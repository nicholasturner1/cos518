              Kel- Talked to Todd about the trip to Dlg for Bryce's bill signing- he agrees that the
              perception would be that this is way too self-serving and "coincidental" that it would
              happen to fall during the peak of the comm fish season- so please scratch that idea of
              traveling to Dlg for it. If Bryce is around Anchorage would he just want it signed
              locally?
