              Speaker Pelosi's office called. The Speaker would like to call you today; likely in regards to the letter you sent
              her. They do not have a specific time and asked if there was a good number to reach you at over the next few
              hours. Would you like me to give them your cell phone? Or would you prefer they call here and we transfer the
              call to you?
