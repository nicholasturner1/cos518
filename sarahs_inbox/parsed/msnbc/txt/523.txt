Subject: mat maid stats




Joey,



Here are the rough stats I put together after talking

to Bob Havemeister.



-The avg. dairy farmer produces 60001b milk per day



-6000lbs=706 gallons



-Mat Maid pays farmers 21.08 per hundred weight



-1,264.80 per day to farmers




                                                    3       ROSTON 00457




Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
-that equates to 1.79 per gallon produced



-461,652.00 per year to each farmer



-2,308,260.00 paid to all farmers



-Approx. 1,288,450 gallons produced yearly by the five

dairies.



-At a retail price of 4.79 gallon , equals 6 ,171,675.00

per year gross



-Since Alaskan milk only comprises about 28% of the

Mat Maid product, multiply gallons of Alaskan milk by

3.5 (imported milk) and you get 21,600,864.00 total

gross (of course this is using the 4.79 per gallon

price and prices vary at different locations)



-Mat Maids wholesale price to retailers in March was

around 4.00 per gal. (I know it was 4.14 for convience

stores, less at big stores). That price has probably

gone up in the last few months.



Conclusion: If Mat Maid were to go to a 100% Alaskan

made product, wholesale it at 4.00 per gallon, the

gross after paying the farmers would be 2,845,540.00.

                                                      4     ROSTON 00458




Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
The question is, is that enough to sustain a small

scale plant? If the wholesale price went up to 5.00

per gallon, gross would go up to 4,133,990.00. We are

only talking liquid milk here.



Keep in mind that the dairies have their own problems.

 Some are debt free and others owe hundreds of

thousands of dollars.



***Note! These are not all official stats so don't

publicly quote them. They're based on some rough

figures given to me.



It will be interesting when you see their books.
