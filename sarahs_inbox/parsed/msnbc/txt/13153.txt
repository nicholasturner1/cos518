            MESSAGE:

            A few weeks ago I contracted your press secretary and voiced my concern for the price of
            fuel here on the Kenai Peninsula. she stated that she would get back to me with an
            answer, I have not received any reply and I really would like to know why the prices here
            on the Peninsula are higher, when we have a refinery located near by where as we get our
            fuel.  I would like an answer to this question>



            Thank You
