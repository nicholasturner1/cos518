            MESSAGE:

            Yakutat has been my home for the past fifty three years. Like most Alaskans I have had my
            opportunities to personally interact with all our governors to some degree and even be
            friends with two but, I have never been so proud to call someone "my governor" as I have
            been since the day I read your family statement regarding Trig and his challenges.



            I am sure I will be disagreeing with you over some of life's little things like CIP
            budgets and gas pipelines but never on the issue of you and your model of personal
            strength, conviction and sense of family.
