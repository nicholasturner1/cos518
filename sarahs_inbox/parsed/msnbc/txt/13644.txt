             I've been worried that either no one knows what to do next, or no one wants to work on
            this one because I've had no assisting movement from anyone on this - so yes, I do need
            you to advise and/or take appropriate action here. Someone needs to tell them to regroup
            and send me another name . I hear their #2 pick may have given up and is applying for other
            jobs, that leaves their #3 (my #1) pick to forward. I don't want to propose replacing
            these bd members - through attrition they're off the bd eventually anyway. But I do want
            the next name(s) to be forwarded asap so we can get moving on hiring a commish.
