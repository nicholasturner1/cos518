            Governor,




            State Supreme Court decision 3-2 holds the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional.




            There are 40 states that currently have parental involvement laws

            There are 26 states that currently have parental consent laws

            There are 3 states that have ruled them unconstitutional:

            California

            Florida

            and now Alaska


         ;Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            More info including the actual ruling are coming , but shall we have Talis work with Mike
            and Sharon on an appropriate response?

            Frank,



                         The Governor should be told that this morning the Alaska Supreme Court issued
            a decision in the Parental Consent case .  The Court by a 3-2 majority, in an opinion
            written by Justice Dana Fabe, held the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional. I am
            the attorney for the State of Alaska in this case and I will be happy to brief anyone on
            this ruling.



            Kevin
