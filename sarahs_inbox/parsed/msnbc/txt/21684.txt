                Governor - I just received a call from a William Schweinitz with Skyline Church in Anchorage. They have a
                prayer group that is praying for you. Apparently you were just speaking with Mayor Joe Williams (KTN) and the
                Mayor was telling you about this group and that they would like to pray over you © the office. In talking with Mr.
                Schweinitz he was under the understanding that you had agreed to do this and would like to set this up therefore
                the phone call. I told Mr. Schweinitz that I would let you know of the call and that either you or I would be back in
                touch with him. Mr. Schweinitz can be reached @: p^vileaed^oi (cell).

                Thanks, Janice
