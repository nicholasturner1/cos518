            Governor:

            I have two presentations for the Cabinet meeting tomorrow:

            1)   It will take at least 60 days for SU to conduct a strike vote. We won't know if they
            intend to do that until after t e arbitrator's decision (on the Class one employees who
           cannot strike) later today. 1privileaed or Personal Material Redacted
           Privileged or Personal Material Red rivileged or Personal Material Redacted     Privileged od
                                                                                             At the
           Cabinet meeting, I'll be passing out the strike plans last done in          an asking
           Commissioners to update them, first with SU in mind, and second - they need to be
           refreshed as a whole anyway. I'll have the lists of SU employees by department for each
           Commissioner, and a list of SU members by community location (trying to anticipate how
           Commissioners will want to see information).

            We will have the arbitrator's decision on Class One employees and I'll be sharing
            highlights from that. I may not talk strategy in front of the whole Cabinet if you have
     i      not been briefed privately prior to the Cabinet meeting.

            2) The second presentation is the roll out of the AO 237 Working            Group report to the
            Cabinet.  I'll have binders for each Cabinet member, one for the            Press Office, for Anna
            Kim-Special Assistant with DOA responsibilities; and, of course             for you and Mike. I'll be
            doing a private briefing with union management after the Cabinet            meeting and then it will
            go up on the web with a media release.
                                                         2

             Thanks - and re: SU I'll just need to know strike plans if it looks like that's where
             folks are headed. Also, the public is not aware of the 40/hr provision that goes along w/
             the raise we're offering. They need to know that, they'll appreciate it, when will
             Alaskans become aware of the offer? It's good for Alaska.

            We'll get on it today. The arbitrator's ruling on Class One SU employees is due today,
            just FYI.  We'll respond after we have a chance to review with Law.

             I'd like to do it tomorrow to get it out of the way. Again , not a big media splash, but a
            sit down with reporters who are interested so they can really grasp where we ' re going:
            con't evaluation of structure , MOV, won 't fight the legislature on its efforts to study
            the move and decide on their pending legislation to move it back... Committment to sound
            oversight and publicly supported permitting process, Etc.



             This media discussion can coincide with our explanation of the state ' s on-line checkbook
            that can begin tomorrow . I'll get an update on that and ask Annette to be ready for that
            tomorrow too. Thanks

             We will be working on the details of habitat roll out today. Have not set a day for
            announcements .  Do you have any preferences ? We will make sure statements and day are
            coordinated with you and the 3rd floor. I just arrived in Anchorage. I will be flying to
            Juneau tonight.  God bless.  Tom
