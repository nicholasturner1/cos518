              Subject: budget

            It was good to get out of Juneau for a day, as I encountered quite a few people who wanted to give
            suggestions on the budget - everyone I talked to is pretty outraged at the size of the thing. Lots of
            examples were given where cuts could/should possibly be made.

            From the $1 Omillion (federal project) rocket launch facility, to Railbelt Energy Funds, $350,000 South
            High's Booster Club request, dust control in Nenana, relection ponds and Fairbanks Dog Park - lots
            more examples. People who have dug a little into it and can not believe what legislators did with pet
            projects and with requests for funding projects on the heels of promises of no more state funds to sustain
            some of these existing projects. And on the heels of campaigns that promised recognition of
            government's proper role.

            Reporters are asking about some of the obvious ones, including ADN pointing out Manly airport
            relocate for a couple million... which I hear would be used to accomodate some who want to fly in but
            just don't want to drive through the community. (It's an example of something obvious that we need to
            look at and ask: it's it an absolute necessity THIS year? Can it wait/be phased in? Is it EVEN
            necessary?)

            Karen - it will be great to see recommendations from your staff re: projects that obviously have to go -
            projects that legislators perhaps had asked for in the past and didn't get - signifying the project isn't
            necessary but were plopped. in in hopes of a new administration having mercy on their project(s). With a
            sensible and conservative look, please have them recommend soon the line items that can wait,. or can
            just be eliminated.

            This will be a lot of work, I'm sure, but we'll set a precedent in this first year that we're serious about
            reigning in government growth by cutting that budget. Thank you.

             Subject: Re: budget
            Governor - we will be reviewing the entire budget and will seek recommendations from departments as well. It will
            be important to be fair and consistent in the analysis . This will take some time as we gather the back up and review
            the justification for the projects. Every item has a constituency! However, I believe we can discern those items that
            government should provide from those that should be supported by the specific group or community. I will work
            with Mr Tibbles and Mr Bitney to being specific recommendations to you. Karen
