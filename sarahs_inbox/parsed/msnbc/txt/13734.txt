            Sorry if this is a duplicate: Tara, you and Rhonda have excellent ideas. I'd like for us
            to answer as many of the questions we can on details and map out a plan before inundating
            the Governor on all this . Perhaps we can. do that tomorrow. I need to find out when we can
            get the bill, and I need to look at pending scheduling requests w/Janice. I"m also copying
            Rosanne as the Communications Dept. needs to be involved in these details. Thanks!

            Kris...




            Tara Jollie and I talked this afternoon about Bridge Signing and the "event " that the
            Governor wants to have in conjunction with it.



            In order to get the ball rolling, we need to figure out:



            1) DATE. (or approximate time frame) Mindy Rowland suggested July, but the Governor
            replied in an email : sooner rather than later . So I'm presuming this means , before her
            baby boy arrives.



            2)   WHAT DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE IN MIND?




            -Does she want to do an event honoring Native women, sort of a positive response to last
            week's talk radio controversy.



            -Or is she thinking that this is the place to launch her efforts to redesign the state
            seal so it reflects Native culture?   Or, is it both?



           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            3)   Is there some significance to Nenana as her choice?           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


            Just some thoughts here to get the ball rolling. We should get Melissa Stepovich in the
            loop to help with the planning. Tara suggested that Ivy Frye coordinate with Janet Mason
            on the schedule.

                                                                2




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01 0015293
