        Yes, Joe Balash did forward a request about a mat-maid meeting for sometime after the
        board met on june 6 ..... I ran it by Mike Tibbles and Mike requested we stand by until we
        learned what the board decided on june 6. I did not receive any further information on
        mat-maid before I left on june B.

         Does anyone have any notice of the Teamsters trying to meet with me two wks ago? This is
        a very significant issue and hopefully the request didn't get lost between the cracks, but
        right now just need to know if they did request a mtg two wks ago. Thanks

         Here's the back-and-forth I had with Barbara Huff.



         Mike said you also asked why I hadn't replied to a question you had

         about Mac Carter. I haven't seen an email like that from you...but the

                                                       2




                                                                                                 P RAGS P01 _0002498
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com      Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




         gist is I think Mac is trying hard to what's right without knowing

         what's right--and the biggest problem we face with him is that he trusts

         Joe Van Treek.



         On Tuesday night when I called him to tell him about the letter and

         request, he was all gung-ho and on board. In fact, he was relieved that

         you were stepping up to keep whatever differences there are between MM

         and DNR out of the way. He told me he thought it would take a slug of

         about $300,000 to re-stock the necessary supplies and keep things open

         at least through the summer and that he would go round up the support on

         the board to honor your request. Later that night I got a call from

         Rhonda Boyles asking me to confirm that what Mac told her was the plan

         was in fact what you wanted to do. However, by morning Mac had been

         turned around.      Rhonda thinks he just gets led around by Van Treek--and

         I think she's right. Not because Mac is out to do the wrong-headed

         thing, but because his vision gets blurry when information is presented

         to him that flies in the face of what he originally thinks is right

          (kind of like some legislators I know).

         Joe:

         Thanks for your response. Based on what you have shared, scheduling the

         meeting after that date is probably an excellent idea.



         We are dealing with some pretty concerned employees who are right now

         looking for answers and direction.     Although we don't believe they are

         the only ones concerned, just the ones we hear from regularly.

         Barbara:



         I can assure you that MatMaid is getting the attention of the

         Governor.     My understanding is that the 600.0 goes through DNR--and

         the leadership of the department is expecting a plan for the funds

         before they are transferred.          The Creamery Corp. and BAC asked for the

         funds and now they are being asked what they intend to do with it.



         I've not been briefed about the upcoming meeting so I'm not aware of

         the options that Van Treek plans to put on the table. I had

         understood there would be multiple options for the board to consider.



         I will forward your request to the scheduling office and see what can

         be done--would it be better to wait until after the meeting on the 6th

         so we see what has been put on the table?



         Joe
