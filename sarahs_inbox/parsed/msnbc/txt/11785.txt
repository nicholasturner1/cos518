             Dear Frank:



             Janet Huckabee is coming to Anchorage tonight.  We are hoping to get Gov. Sarah Palin to
             meet her.  Can you contact her and ask her if this is a possibility? If it is, I am able
             to get Heartbeat Alaska to make an ad to show tomorrow. I would be able to get a few
             Natives together and it would go Nationwide.



             Sorry for the short notice , but God bless you speedily to make the arrangements.



             Thanks,



             B. Akey C.
