             Frank,

             Bryce Edgmon replaced Ben Stevens as the Legislature 's representative (appointed by Governor Palin 4/18/07).

             Per AS 16.45 . 020 commission members (in this case Stephanie Madsen ) can be removed for cause only.

            Hi Ivy,

            I had the same supporters who contacted me about this in early June ask if the state's website was still
            current in showing Ben Stevens and Stephanie Madsen on the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission.

            Governor,

           I met with two strong supporters last night from the fisheries sector that expressed concern about Ben
           Stevens and Stephanie Madsen showing currently on the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission. They
           said it appears they could be removed for cause, and recommended that Ben be removed immediately
           and Madsen be removed when her NPFMC term expires . Their concern with Madsen was that on a
           Commission that involves all western pacific states, she would be serving the interests of her employer,
           At Sea Processors , not the State of Alaska.

            Here are the links:
