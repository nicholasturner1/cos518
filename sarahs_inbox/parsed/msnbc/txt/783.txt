Todd:



I have been working with Erika on getting the

Foundation a gaming permit. I have amended the

Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws. I believe

Darla Buck opened a seperate gaming bank account on

Friday. I'll have the application ready to be filed

tomorrow. The only thing that may hold us up is you

have to have 25 members. Counting our current group

of 12 we need 13 more. I have one or two people who

will join, but I don't think I can come up with 13 so

I am hoping Erika has been successful in finding some

more people.



Because of the processing time for a new permit of 2

weeks, I suggest we continue trying to move as fast as

possible to get our own permit but we could also ask

Juneau High School Football team to add us to their

permit. If our permit comes through in time, we won't

need them, but if we get held up, we can still move

forward with the event and raffle.
