             The crew has informed me that weather in jno is suppose to go below minimums at midnight.
             Sitka is also suppose to go down. They recommend a 9 pm departure. Apparently heavy snow
             with low visability headed that direction. Weather not expect to get better until 6pm
             tomorrow.  please advise.
