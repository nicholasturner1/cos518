           Governor Palin,

           I followed up with Mark yesterday . He feels he's most suited for Juvenile Justice or Human Rights Commissions.

           There are expired terms on Juvenile Justice and a vacancy on Human Rights Commission (Chris Hayes
           resigned). I talked to LaDonna about Human Rights Commission , and she didn 't seem too excited about it. She
           said she would do it, but was more interested in land /hunting issues, specifically unit 13.

           What do you think about Mark for Juvenile Justice or Human Rights?

           Thank you,

           Ivy Frye
