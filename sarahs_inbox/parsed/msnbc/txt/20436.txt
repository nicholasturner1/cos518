                                  Governor Remains Hopeful as Search Continues
              August 16, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today remains hopeful for a
              positive outcome in the search for Deputy Revenue Commissioner Brian Andrews and his
              son Brandon. The two were returning from a family camping trip on Young Lake when their
              plane vanished. Governor Palin and Revenue Commissioner Pat Galvin have been in contact
              with the Andrews family this week.

             "Todd and I continue to pray for Brian and Brandon's safe return ," Governor Palin said.
             "Our thoughts are with Joyce and B .J. and Nikki as the search continues . We join the family
             in expressing sincere appreciation for the efforts of the U .S. Coast Guard, Juneau Mountain
             Rescue, and the countless Alaskans who have volunteered their time, money, and search
             equipment to this ongoing effort."

              Weather in the search area has improved. The search is focusing on the Mansfield
              Peninsula of Admiralty Island.
