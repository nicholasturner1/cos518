             This shouldn't be a problem. When I spoke to Tara earlier she was working on a letter.
             Colleen should be able to attend. Mark is in the office as well so will be there to cover.
             I'll follow-up w/Colleen.

             Governor -



             Nick Begich just called to let us know about the passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones, the
             last native speaker of the Eyak language. She was 89 years old. Mr. Begich's wife is
             Sheila Slate who is the adopted daughter of Chief Smith. Sheila and Chief Jones met the
             Governor at an event at the Alaska Native Heritage center just a month or two ago. Chief
             Slate thought the world of the Governor, and so her family just wanted to let the Governor
             know of her passing. The funeral is this Friday, with a viewing from 11am-lpm and funeral
             service at 1:00.  Then they'll have the traditional potlatch after 40 days.



             Note : We have short staff in ANC so I don't know if we want Colleen or I can check w/Lt.
             Governor on attending this service. Privile ed or Personal Material Redacted so we will be down
             to Abbey, Colleen in office on Thursday and Friday - 01.24, 01.25. Tanks, Janice
