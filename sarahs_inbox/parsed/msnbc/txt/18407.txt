         Got it!!! :)



         They're so sick of all my emails today, I bet they do NOT read the links on down to your
         original message . No problem...



         And I just spoke to Glen Beigel - topic shifted to your, and others , futures. Some day
         we'll chat about the future...

         And I'm going to meet with Glen for coffee next week perhaps.
