         Your last paragraph was communicated to Sheila. Sharon's got the "in" with

         Sheila and so I'm not sure if all has been communicated at this point.

          Larry understands the complexities of interpretting F & G regulations, as

          was evidenced by his having to pay a fine for a timing violation on the

          water.




           (and humorously ,   it's the sign of a true SE fisherman - he's got a small

          violation on his record now, some true fishermen would say)

         As Larry evidently disclosed in the attached email from Ivy - he wasn't even

         on the water when the violation occurred, but he owned the pot so he owned

         up to the mistake.

         Yes.    This was discussed in our meetings with the above mentioned and

         Commissioner Lloyd.       He disclosed it in his cover letter.




         "In the summer of 2006, I owned a king crab pot that was involved in a

         misdemeanor violation (set hours too early). Another individual was

         authorized to set or retrieve my pot under his own permit. I was not present

         for the violation, but was the owner of the pot and received a ticket which

         I paid."

         Sharon : Is this the Larry Edfelt who was cited last year for a fishing

         violation , ABWE Troopers ini Juneau , fishing for crab during a closed

         season?     I haven ' t checked the court computer file yet so don't know how it

         came out . Looks like he put his pot in 2-3 hours before season opened,

         personal use, fined $ 200, crab seized .     Age 63 so looks like the same guy.




         No big deal but maybe earish.



         Regards ,   Sheila

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

         Governor Palin Fills Vacancy on Board of Fisheries




         March 8, 2007, Juneau, AK - Governor Palin today announced the appointment

         of Juneau resident , Larry Edfelt ,   to the Alaska Board of Fisheries .          Edfelt

         previously served on the board from 1992-1997.




          "I am honored that someone of Larry ' s stature and experience has agreed to

         come back and serve the state again on this important board," said Governor

         Palin.     "He's familiar with Alaska fisheries from a number of vantage

         points.     His vision and temperament are just what this board needs."




         Edfelt retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in 1986 ,            after a

                                                           6

        distinguished 23-year career.          He served as a fisheries biologist, Deputy

        Director of Commercial Fisheries, and Assistant Executive Director of the

        Boards of Fisheries and Game before his retirement. He has also worked as a

        charter boat owner and operator. Edfelt is well known around Alaska for his

        humorous columns published in the Juneau Empire and the Anchorage Daily

        News.




        The seven members of the Alaska Board of Fisheries are appointed by the

        Governor, subject to legislative confirmation, to conserve and develop the

        fishery resources of the state.         This involves setting seasons, bag limits,

        methods and means for the state's subsistence, commercial, sport, guided

        sport, and personal use fisheries, and it also involves setting policy and

        direction for the management of the state's fishery resources .               The board is

        charged with making allocative decisions, while the Department of Fish and

        Game is responsible for management based on those decisions.




        Edfelt will participate as a voting member at the Board's next meeting, from

        March 9th to March 13th in Anchorage, during which the board will take up

        statewide finfish and supplemental issues. If confirmed by the Legislature,

        Edfelt will fill the seat vacated by Rupe Andrews of Juneau, who resigned

        last month.
