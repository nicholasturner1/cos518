                  Subject: organ donor?

                Govemor-

                Alaska has reached a milestone . More than half of Alaska 's residents are organ and tissue donors.
                We are the only state to achieve this milestone. I was going to write a quick press release thanking
                donors. Just checking to see if you are a donor - if so I was going to mention it.
