Subject :                Capitol power bill


Todd:



Here's what the state paid to keep the Capitol building in power for the last five months:



May bill: $8200

April bill: $9200

March bill: $9700

Feb bill: $9300

Jan bill: $6600



There are variables at work here that make estimating the next bill kind of dicey, but the person I
spoke with at AEL&P said Juneau as a whole has cut its kilowatt-hour usage by 40 percent. She said
it is not unreasonable to assume that the Capitol could operate similarly conservation-mindedly. The
other factor that may come into play is a trip to the RCA coming up, during which AEL&P hopes to
make the case for lowering the current 52 cents per kwh charge (up from 11 cents before the
avalanche).



Quick math says take the three bills that represent the peak usage ( Feb, March , April) and get an
average of $ 9400 . Reduce that by the 40 percent conservation factor to get $ 5640 , then multiply that
by 4.73 to cover the 473 percent increase in rates , and the bottom line becomes $26,677. Any RCA-
approved reduction in kwh rate from 52 cents would decrease the total further.



In the unlikely circumstance that the building has electric heat, it is reasonable to assume that
decreased heat consumption in June would also bring a reduction in the bottom line.



Let me know if I can be of any further help.
