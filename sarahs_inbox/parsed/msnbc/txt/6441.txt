             Subject: KTVA - A quirk in the law means two Alaskans are without dividends this year
            Governor Palin, my name is Paul Reed and I live in Wasilla. I am retired Air Force as well as a retired
            State of Alaska employee. I am a 28 year Alaskan resident. I would appreciate you taking the time to
            read the linked article and look into the possibility of reviewing the allowable absences affected by this
            issue . Mine and my wife's PFD's have been denied and are now in appeal. I doubt I' ll be able to win my
            appeal based on the way the allowances are written but I feel I am justified in requesting that it be
            reviewed. I realize that you are a very busy person so I have taken the liberty of copying this to several
            other possible interested parties. This was televised back in March and many folks have now been
            involved. Any and all assistance would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

            One more thing on a personal note - Madam Governor without question everyone I have spoken to is
            extremely proud to have you as governor. We here in Wasilla are extremely proud of you, the job you are
            doing and wish you continued success. You have given us back our dignity as a state. Thank you!

            Paul T. Reed
