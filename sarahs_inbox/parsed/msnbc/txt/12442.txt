               They did not tell us about last week' s meeting. This was the human resources
               component of AFN. So, perhaps they feel their issues should be addressed
               separately . They had quite a few items on their agenda ranging from rural law
               enforcement to federal legislation.

                   Subject: Congressional Delegation Relations - PRIVILEGED AND
                   CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE


                   At Senator Stevens' request, Larry and I met this morning with Senator
                   Murkowski and him, plus various staff from all three offices to discuss the gas
                   pipeline and Congressional earmarks, particularly in the transportation area.
                   The meeting was difficult but useful.

                  There are fundamental differences between the State and the Congressional
                  delegation on the gas pipeline. In my opinion, these differences are not the
                  product of inadequate information. Rather, they reflect differences of opinion
                  about AGIA and about what is possible in DC concerning the bridge shipper,
                  changes in the loan guarantee, and the risk of re-opening existing federal law.
                  There was also discussion of whether TransCanada can be held liable for costs

                   incurred by the original pipeline consortium formed many years ago.

                   We raised the possibility that these differences might dissipate once the AGIA
                   process has been completed . Both TransCanada and the producers have said
                   that they want to work with each other , and there is a good likelihood that the
                   issue of fiscal certainty will be addressed once we know what the State is dealing
                   with. Senator Stevens believes that ConocoPhillips might file an application
                   directly with FERC.

                   Regarding earmarks, Senator Stevens thinks that there is a difference between
                   what the State says and does on earmarks . I responded that we don't see all
                   earmarks as bad, only those where there is no strong federal nexus or public
                   support and where there is no open and transparent process. In particular, I
                   cited your response to Carl Marrs and our 31 earmark requests , all of which
                   satisfy applicable requirements.

                   Then , the discussion switched to transportation earmarks . The delegation wants
                   DOTPF to communicate more with local governments about the status of their
                   earmarks . We also talked about how requirements of the Federal Highway
                   Administration play into the process.

                   We said that DOTPF is preparing an analysis of all pending transportation
                   earmarks so that the delegation can see their current status and why some of
                   them have not been implemented. We also asked for early consultation between
                   the Congressional delegation and us to resolve problems before they arise in
                   federal law.

                   Senator Stevens said that he is prepared to respond publically and critically when
                   he sees a discrepancy between the administration 's statements and actions on
                   earmarks. I also had the feeling that he might talk more about infirmities in the
                   AGIA approach.

                   As you know, Senator Murkowski will give her speech to the Legislature on March
                   18th . She would like to meet with you one-on-one to discuss relations among the
                   elected principals , feeling that since she is not running for re-election this year,
                   she might be in the best position to do this.

                   I will brief Mike Tibbles in greater detail and would be glad to talk with you as
                   well.

                   P.S.
                   We met this afternoon with the Human Resources Committee of the AFN. They
                   would like very much to meet with you as well to discuss a number of federal and
                   state issues that they reviewed with us . In the meantime , we will follow-up, as
                   needed , with various Commissioners.
