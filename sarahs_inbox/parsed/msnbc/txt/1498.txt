   Steven Howell from Parnell's campaign called in to deny replacing ads with Palin's name in it.
   He said it was coincedental that the ad was changed, they placed the buy a few weeks ago, and
   that an ad with Palin will run again in a few weeks.




   Kristi Green/Leaf/Babcock just called in to defend Chuck Kopp. She said he's a great guy, loved
   in the community, and she doesn't believe the sexual abuse allegations.

    Just listened to Ramras on Fagan. He said Baily and Frye are fine enough people but
    he's not worried about what is found on them in the emails. What he's worried about is
    fine individuals like John Bitney and Mike Tibbles. Also, Todd Palin has been doing
    more than literacy campaigns and breast cancer awareness and that's clear. Ramras says
    he saw you going from office to office durin ACES. He's also watching with amusement
    Sean's chameleon act, and said he should have been running his own campaign all
    along. Dan played the clips of Sean's ads. One with Sarah's name in it, and the other
    without it. Frank, did Sean really do this??
