                        Sharon:

                        LAW was able to get a bill draft done . It is being circulated now for final comments from agencies and
                        any last minute edits. If there are none, and I should know by 1 :00 pm and will call you to confirm either
                        way, this is a bill draft that could be posted as an intemet link and referenced in the press release.

                        Thanks,

                        Randy
