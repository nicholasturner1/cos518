            Dear Governor Palin, We have prevailed over the effort to enjoin seismic testing for oil exploration.
            Attached is Judge Beistline's order from today. The injunction to stop testing was denied and dismissed.
            It is a good win. It will probably be appealed. Tails

            Congratulations to Jen Schorr and Jon Katchen for their part in this successful decision from Judge
            Beistline in the seismic surveys matter. Our intervention was granted and the state's interests considered
            in the decision denying the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion.
