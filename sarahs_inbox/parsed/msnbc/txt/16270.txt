            Hello,



            It's been 15 days since I received your inadequate autoreply from this governor's office.
            Please reply with an appropriate answer and with the reassurance that I will not be
            getting anymore calls from Ivy Frye 623 698-6986 or any other number associated with Ivy.
            I would like to request a list of phone numbers that are assigned to Ivy Frye. You do
            realize that Ivy called me for the sole purpose to tell me that I better stop blogging on
            ADN. I'm not sure what you are up to Sarah, but I expect a real response with an
            explanation from you.
