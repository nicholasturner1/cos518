           Superior Court Upholds Lieutenant Governor ' s Initiative Decision




           February 29, 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - Fairbanks Superior Court Judge Douglas L.
           Blankenship ruled on Thursday that Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell took proper action
           regarding the 07WATR and 07WTR3 initiatives .   The initiatives propose requirements to new
           large scale metallic mineral mining operations in Alaska.

            In his ruling dated February 28, 2008 , Judge Blankenship concluded that, " Lieutenant
            Governor Parnell was correct in refusing to certify 07WATR because it is an appropriation.
            The lieutenant governor's certification of 07WTR3 as a regulatory measure was correct."




            Lieutenant Governor Parnell commented on Thursday's ruling, stating that, "It's important
            to get certainty and finality on these significant water and mining issues .  Though the
            decision will likely be appealed., it brings us one step closer to an Alaska Supreme Court
            decision on whether the initiative is the proper route for deciding these issues or
            whether that is the Legislature's exclusive domain."




            If this decision is appealed as expected to the Alaska Supreme Court, it will most likely
            be consolidated with the lieutenant governor' s appeal of a separate Superior Court
            decision ruling in favor of the initiative sponsors.
