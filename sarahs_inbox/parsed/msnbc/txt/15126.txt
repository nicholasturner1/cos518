             We'll get a transcript asap. Harris had some pretty tough words tonight.

            What?? We're not calling the energy sp session b/c of harris' letter!! Mike Ross has it
            wrong. We were talking about this weeks ago-back when we were discussing suspending the
            gad tax. Gov Palin had foresight on this one-i have the emails to prove it.
