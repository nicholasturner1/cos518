        We have just enough wine for these next two events- and then we'll be an alcohol free
        home.




        We ONLY have enough wine at the House for this week- the rest (hard liquor, beer & wine)
        was removed yesterday and this morning.

        They can keep the wine/champagne in fridge - its the hard liquor that's gotta go

        Serving wine at Foundation Fundraiser and Juneau World Affairs Reception yes/no?



         I wanted to double check about serving wine at either of these events. I assumed we
        would not serve wine, but wasn't sure if we'd begin the new policy this week- or wait
        until next week when it's put forth through the media.




         They've taken most of the inventory out of the House, but they have the beverage fridge
        and the basement closet to finish up tomorrow.



         Thank you,


                                                                1
