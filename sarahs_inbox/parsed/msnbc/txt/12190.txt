                MESSAGE:
                Governor Palin:

                I just wanted to say that it was at this time two years ago when you and I were in
                Juneau and rode back on the plane to Anchorage together. You were just starting to
                seriously think about running for governor and I encouraged you to do so.

                I want to tell you that I think you are doing an excellent job as governor of our
                state and representing the needs of Alaska!  I had this "intuition" (that nurses
                have and nobody can explain) that you were the right person for the job. Don't let
                anybody sway your common sense and gut feelings about what is right in making your
                decisions.  You have that "nursing intuition" for our state.

                I am proud to have supported you then, during your campaign, and now as our
                Governor!  You are an example of what it means to be a woman in Alaska! Thank you!
