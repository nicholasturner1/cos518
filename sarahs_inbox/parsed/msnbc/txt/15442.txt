             Governor,

             As you finalize your vetoes of the 2009 Capital budget, I would like to make a pitch for those items in the capital budget that
             are for roads and buildings - those appropriations that employ Alaskan and build something tangible.

             As we ramp up to be ready for the construction of the gas line , it is imperative that we continue all the efforts across the state
             in workforce development so that we not only replace the workers retiring for the industry every year, but we increase the
             number of Alaskans trained and working in construction.

             Essential to this increase in the workforce is an increase every year in the states capital budget so there are projects and jobs
             available for those entering the construction workforce. More workers = more jobs = more projects = bigger capital budget

             Increasing that number of construction jobs every year in anticipation and readiness is the single most effective thing we can
             do maximize the benefit of gas line construction for Alaskans

             In Bullet form:

                   As we put effort into workforce development, we need to have jobs for the apprentices entering the workplace
                   Contractors need projects in order to employ the new entries into the workforce. Presently employers are limited in the
             number of apprentices they can hire because of the amount of work there is
                   We need to steadily increase the States Capital Budget and the amount of construction projects on the street for the
             next 6-8 years (at least) to provide an growing workforce to be ready to jump to the Gas line project in 8-10 years

             Will we overheat the economy? NO.

             I am not concerned about overheating the economy . I am concerned about cooling off the workforce as we attempt to expand
             it. We need a healthy capital budget to be prepared for the gas line construction to maximize the benefit for Alaskans.

             Thank you for your consideration.
