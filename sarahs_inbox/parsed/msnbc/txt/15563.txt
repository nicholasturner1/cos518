            Karen, 600 words is fine if your submitting an op-ed; 250 words for a letter to the
            editor. I'll take a look now. Thanks for writing this. Ivy

           Governor and all - attached is a draft - not even close to 225 words! I

           have 636!     I appreciate help in paring this down but don't want to lose

           some of the key points - I can certainly make any suggested edits here

           so we don't get too many versions out there - also, don't know if this

           is coming from you or from me. Would be very easy to change for your

            signature!



            let me know how you would like me to proceed with this - thanks! Karen

            Yes, I agree for that to be mentioned . We need this message as soon as

           possible as lawmakers are all gathered together over these next few

           days.

            If possible we need to include something on how the huge Ed funding

            should've alleviated the need for all of these individual tiny projects

            to get funded. I hear over and over that the jam up in distribution is

            at the District level here in Anch, the inequities, etc in how funds ae

            distributed within district.

           We really need to message this right (hopefully it's not too late to do

           so) re: "cuts" in so many cases were not CUTS to exisiting levels of

           operating funds, they were reductions in the increased requests by

           lawmakers.



           Also, the letter needs to explain our desire for balance along with the

           other principles we used to prioritize.



           Also to remind pers/trs relief, increased muni shares, huge savings.

           A111 those things were lost in mainstream media coverage of our budget.



           A sentence in there must explain we have just allocated the largest

           amount of money, ever in state's history, for education (and still it's

           bickered about that it's not enough, so says a mayor or official or

           two)!
