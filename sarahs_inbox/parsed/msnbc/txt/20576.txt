             Thank you folks...I assume they didn't rule in time for today's appeal. Thank you for your work on this.

               Laura Ingraham just mentioned the governor as a good VP pick on Greta van Susteren (sp?).

               Right. She usually just reads part of it - not the whole thing. But like you said, we can distribute it.

               Not sure if she'll actually read the whole thing, given that we're trying to keep this fairly succinct, but we would
               distribute it to reporters.

              Tara and Abbey,

              I am sending verbage for a proclamation to Jessalynn . She is going to expedite it through the process and get it
              back-to us ASAP Monday . The Governor will be reading the proclamation at a bill signing event on Monday. If you
              both could please help us work with Jessalynn to get it printed off on the right paper and put in the binder for the
              Governor Monday that would be very, very helpful . Thanks!
