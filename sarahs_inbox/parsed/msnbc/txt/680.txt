Sharon,



FYI.



When I spoke with Harris I didn't mention Bitneys name

at all.Bitney is a master at having other people do

his dirty work,his co-workers.For Dillon to say that I

have great influence (I don't) would only come from

Bitney.



Do you remember what happened right after I'll called

Harris,Bitney wrote a letter to the editor for Harris

supporting me going back to work.



Thanks Todd
