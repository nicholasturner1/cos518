          Back in August , we were told by PFC that they decided not to hold an annual dinner at the
          annual meeting this year .   That meant that the traditional announcement venue wouldn't
          occur . Because of that , we were told it was up to the Governor and Revenue how the
          announcement would be made .   I told them we would figure out a venue and make the
          announcement .  The plans for a September 19 announcement proceeded from there .  It was the
          last I heard from PFC, and I never got the impression that they felt slighted or had an
          alternative venue.



         The meeting starting tomorrow is in Fairbanks .  I see on the agenda that they have a
         "community reception " scheduled for Monday at 6, with "dinner on own " after that.   I'll
         check with PFC staff to see what may be the source of the Ear comment .   If it seems
         appropriate , I'll ask someone to contact Toomey with a correction.



          -Pat

          Governor,



          Received now. I was not aware of any need or discussion to hold it in Fairbanks.



          I read the Ear story today suggesting that the announcement was originally scheduled to
          take place in Fairbanks tomorrow . That is news to me . It had been scheduled by Revenue
          for last week.

           Pat and Mike - in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd , I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks , and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event " out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate , and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea , I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past , except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate , hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.



           If this was " hijackiing " it or it was out of line ,    surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
