           Governor:



           A draft response to the Juneau Delegation's letters (May 5, May 20) on the energy
           situation in Juneau is attached. If the preference is to not respond, please disregard
           the draft.  If the choice is to respond, please send edits to me. As enclosures I have
           the RCA letter orders and the Empire article citing June 8th as the estimated date for
           restoring hydro power.



           Thanks



           Randy
