             Amen! The reporters should have asked - they let her get away with way too much. Thanks!

             That was fun last night,

             And now we have our pass to refuse other offers of help - we killed too birds with one
             stone.

             I'm going to do some follow up this morning ..... this might be our chance to catch her in a
             lie if indeed there was no verbal invite.

             Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
             again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
             lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
