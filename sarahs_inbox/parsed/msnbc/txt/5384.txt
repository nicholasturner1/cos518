                  Subject: Travel and ethics clarification , 2:00pm March 13

                We have scheduled a meeting on Tuesday , March 13, at 2:00pm for discussion about travel and ethics for the
                Governor and First Gentleman . There seems to be confusion on the answers to questions about First Gentleman
                and children ' s travel and per diem, using the King Air, TA's, per diem, and so forth. The idea is to do things right
                from the get- go so we don't have any questions about how we should have done it later.

                If AG Colberg , the designated ethics supervisor for the Governor, and Linda Perez could be available to answer
                these questions, hopefully confusion about what is okay and what is not okay for the First Family can be
                eliminated and our First Family will not need to spend time worrying about this.
