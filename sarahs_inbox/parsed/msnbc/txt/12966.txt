                 John: Thank you for your pleasant and insightful email in regard to our management of wildlife in Alaska.
                 With informed citizens such as yourself I am sure all of the wild critters in your state are carefully and
                 humanely managed. In case you are not aware 80% of the prey species in Alaska that die each year are
                 killed by the helpless and innocent bears and wolves you refer to in your email. I suspect our moose and
                 caribou don't see them in the same light as you do, but then I am sure you are much more informed than
                 they. As far as you visiting our state, I would have to discourage you from doing that as there are a
                 number of vile, despicable and loathsome people here who do eat moose and caribou because they don't
                 have a Safeway to buy meat from or have a slaughterhouse to do their killing for them. I am sure you
                 have both so you can be a person of conscience and be nobler than these poor wretches. By the way,
                 these vile people harvest about 5% of the animals each year. In regard to your wish for the disposition of
                 our souls I hope you are mistaken, but if not I am sure I will see you there. Sincerely Bob

                  Dear Alaskan wildlife officials,

                 Just wanted to thank you for making my decision , and that of everyone I know, an easy one to never set
                 foot in your state or knowingly support anything that has to do with Alaska . Your continued
                 slaughtering of wolves from the air and otherwise , and decision to do the same to bears, is reprehensible
                 in the extreme and will not be tolerated by people of conscience!

                 I don't give a damn about your bogus , unfounded rationale of increasing ungulate populations for
                 subsistence--read trophy and sport--hunting, only a vile, despicable , loathsome human being could
                 approve of and/or participate in such a barbaric , inhumane endeavor. What the hell gives you the right to
                 arbitrarily massacre other sentient beings to euphemistically "manage" them?!

                 Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world , but if we did anyone involved in and/or supportive of
                 these decisions would suffer the same fate as what is being cruelly inflicted on helpless , innocent wolves
                 and bears. Although I'm not a religious person , I take great comfort in knowing that all of you will one
                 day be burning in Hell for your evil actions!

                 Scornfully,
                 John Sodrel
