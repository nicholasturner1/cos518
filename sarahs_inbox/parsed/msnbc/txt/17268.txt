         Thanks Governor.       We agree that state employee/helicopter intervention

         should be a last resort. We're investigating options for incentives: fuel

         reimbursement, harvest dividends, etc.



         It is unfortunate that this has focused on you. I'd like to shift the focus

         back onto the department.



         DL.

         I didn't know daily news was already publishing on wolves. Bottom line:state

         helicopters should be last resort ,     they're expensive and take opportunity

         from locals.



        We need to pay for locals ' fuel , bounty on predators , etc. Until

          these offers are exhausted we need more aggressive pursuit of incentives

        provided to those most affected by the predator problem.



        Also, curious as to why Board passes buck to governor on this one but not

        other biological management decisions ? Makes it political .



        We have to act quickly on this as predators are acting quickly and rural

        families face ridiculous situation of being forced to import more beef

        instead of feeding their families our healthy staple of alaskan game.

        Nonsense . Unacceptable - and not on my watch.

        Todd interviewed buddies who live out there... Some confirmation that state

        intervention isn't first choice w/the locals. But we need to incentivize

        here. $ for trappers included.

        Helping hands




        Posted: March 8, 2007 - 2:09 pm



        Remember the state senators who were disappointed about having to foot their

        own bill to the annual Energy Council conference in Washington, D.C.?



        Well, a talk show radio host heard their story and offered to help them out

        to the tune of $500 each. Mike Porcaro of station KENI-AM in Anchorage had

                                                                3

         some of the boys from the Senate minority -        Sens . Gene Therriault, Tom

         Wagoner and Fred Dyson - on a show last week and pledged to help them fund

         their transportation costs to the oil and gas fest. Sure enough, the radio

         host confirmed earlier this week to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that he

         had signed off and sent each of them a check.



         In a press conference call this morning, Therriault said he and his

         colleagues were in DC to spread the news about Gov. Palin ' s new AGIA bill on

         the gas pipeline and reassure the nation that Alaska was serious about

         getting its natural gas to market . He said he ' s been meeting with

         representatives from pipeline regulator FERC and other federal and state

         representatives to explain how the Legislature in Juneau will be tackling

         AGIA to get it worked and passed this session.



         in the kudos for the Daily News department - Therriault said he's been

         explaining the differences between the Murkowski plan and Palin's AGIA

         legislation using a diagram and chart published with last Saturday ' s Daily

         News story on the bill ' s introduction.



         Thanks for making us look good,       senators.



         Therriault and the Senate minority gang are attending the conference with

         several other Alaskan legislators from both chambers . They return next week

         to get started on the first AGIA hearings , among other things.
