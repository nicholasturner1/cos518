            I returned Suzanne's (Rep Meyer' s cos ) phone call yesterday re: the op-ed. Below is her
            response.



            His office is saying they haven't heard from the 3rd floor re: a hearing request for this
            bill.  I work on hearing requests all the time. I'm more than happy to draft the language
            and send to Russ to expedite the process-it will take 10 minutes tops, I know the bill
            backwards and forwards.  I could even send it to Kris to send to Russ as to not step on
            toes.

            Ivy,

            Thanks for the phone call yesterday . We appreciate it. The funny thing is, I went back
            and looked at hearing requests that I have received, and we haven ' t even received a
            hearing request from the administration for HB 106.



            Suzanne
