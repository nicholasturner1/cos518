           MESSAGE:

           I'm excited to read your article regarding the Alaska Construction Academy in your recent
           newsletter . Elders and people with disabilities in rural Alaska are in need of
           construction workers who are licensed , bonded and insured and capable of developing cost
           estimates and completing the work for building ramps and doing archetecturally accessible
           home modifications.



           Please include these issues within your Academy curriculums and increase the availability
           of Alaska Construction Academies in rural locations in Bristol Bay, the Yukon Kuskokwim,
           Bering Straits, and Northwest Arctic. I work with these issues and travel to these rural
           locations with both Arctic Access and Access Alaska, Alaska Independent Living programs.
           Thank you for your attention, Audrey Aanes
