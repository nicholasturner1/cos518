                Thank you.

                NOTE:

                There are also now 3 entities wanting the cost and project information from KABATA ; FHWA, the State, and
                AMATS. FHWA must approve the project and sign the Record of Decision (ROD) for the project to move
                forward. Frank Richards and I met with FHWA last week. FHWA has been working on their own review of the
                project and have a lot of the same questions we do . FHWA will probably not sign the Record of Decision on the
                NEPA process KABATA needs to actually build until KABATA provides satisfactory answers to all the questions.
                FHWA also asked if they could work with the State to review the project, which we agreed to do. AMATS has
                also asked KABATA for cost and project information . AMATS could amend their Long Range Transportation Plan
                to remove the project which would stop it cold.
