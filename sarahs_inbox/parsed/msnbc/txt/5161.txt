            Bob,



            Just wanted to send you a quick update...



            We continue to explore ways in which to make your great idea work!



            One of the challenges is that current gaming regulations state that the permit holder (the
            non-profit, not the state) conducting the raffle must own the prize free & clear. So,
            maybe three non-profits could get together, buy the jet, raffle it off and then the
            proceeds could be distributed for charitable purposes...



            I'm still working this and will keep my favorite DJ posted! I'm going into a meeting, but
            I'll call you later today.



            Kris
