               This was sent out to all papers tonight. There's an additional table which lays
               out all of the changes to the contract. Randy Ruaro has it, I believe. We will be
               posting this on the DOA main webpage tomorrow, so it'll be easily accessible -
      I        you won't have to fmd this email.
