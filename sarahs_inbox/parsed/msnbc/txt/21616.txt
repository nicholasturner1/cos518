                  Subject: leaving DOT

                Governor

                I am writing you to officially tender my resignation as Deputy Commissioner for the Alaska Department of
                Transportation and Public Facilities . I plan to stay through December to help finalize our'09 budget and tie-up a
                few loose ends.

                Working for the people of Alaska for the past five years has been a very satisfying experience. I have especially
                appreciated being able to continue my employment as a member of your administration . Between the
                professionals here at DOT/PF and your office's incredibly helpful public servants, most notably Mike Tibbles,
                Randy and Russ , I could not have asked for a more professional , talented or dedicated group of colleagues.

                While I will miss this job and my friends at DOT, I feel that it is time for a new challenge and experience and thus
                will be accepting a position in the private sector . If there is anything I can do to be of assistance during my
                replacement's transition, please know that I will be available to assist in any way possible.

                I also want you to know if there is anything I can do to assist you personally as Governor , I am also available.
