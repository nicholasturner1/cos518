                Hi Governor Palin,
                         I'm a reporter with the Topeka Capital -Journal in KS. Just for fun, I'm working on an article posing
                the question of what Bill Clinton will be titled if his wife is elected president . Up till now it's been "First
                Lady ," but what will the guy in the equation be called if the president is a woman? To bring it down to
                earth a bit more , I'm contacting some girl governors to find out what their husbands are officially called.
                Of course, we have a female governor here in KS, and her husband has adopted the title of "First Dude."
                What does your spouse like to be known as? Just for a good time, and thanks very much!
                Anne
