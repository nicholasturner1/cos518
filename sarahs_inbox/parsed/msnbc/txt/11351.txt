              MESSAGE:

             I am with the Personal Watercraft Club of Alaska (PWCA) and we have sent Governor Palin 4
             letters over the course of the last 9 months. We have not had any reply from her office.
             Although we have not agreed with the past administrations politics regarding land/water
             equal access issues we always received a response directly from the Governor in regards to
             our letters.



             PWCA would like to arrange a meeting with the Governor directly to discuss our concerns
             regarding equal access use of Kachemak Bay. Personal watercraft were unfairly banned from
             the area under the Knowles administration. With new watercraft meeting and exceeding all
             new emission standards we feel it's time to take another look at this unfair ban on these
             type of boats.



             Governor Palin can call me, email me or snail mail me directly. I am the secretary of the
             Personal Watercraft and would be able to confirm a time and place for a meeting with
             Governor Palin.



             Sincerely,
