           MESSAGE:

           Dear Govenor Palin,




           My wife Nancy and I want you to know how blessed we are by you and your family' s attitude
           towards Trigg and his blessing in your life.



           Nancy and I are equally blessed by his presence in our lives as members of your great
           state . God has blessed us all by giving us a Govenor and family who have been deemed
           worthy of one of God ' s great blessings.



           Imagine, we are the only state in the entire union who has a "First Trigg."



           Thank you
