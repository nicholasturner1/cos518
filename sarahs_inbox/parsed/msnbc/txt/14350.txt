           My heart is heavy and grieved to see and hear what is

           going on between the two of you. I urge you both to

           find a spiritual peacemaker that you both can trust

           and both of you get together with him (her)and God and

           get this taken care of - before - if it hasn't ready

           affected you both spiritually. I am crying as I write

           this as I care so much for both you. Love edna




                                    THERE IS A GOD AND HE CARES FOR YOU!!!!

              Governor,

              You are confirmed to attend the Alaska Native Justice Center 's "Building Momentum " conference in Anchorage on
              Monday morning . The event begins at 8:30 a . m. and , as it stands now, you are scheduled to speak last, at about
              9:10 (approximate time). If you arrive at 8 :25 a.m ., you will be seated onstage at a head table with the other
              speakers (the attendees will be finishing breakfast); if you choose to come later, you could arrive at 9 :05 a.m., sit
              at the back of the room until you are introduced, take the stage to deliver remarks , and then leave the event.
              Please let me know if you prefer to arrive at 8:25 or 9 :05 a.m. Also, if you'd like to speak first, that is also an
              option.

              Please respond at your earliest convenience . Kris will be dropping off information related to tomorrow's Bike
              Blessing as well as Monday 's conference with you tonight. Thanks so muchl
