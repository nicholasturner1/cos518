                 Subject: Resignation
                 Ma'am,
                 Having received telephonic notification from a staff member that my volunteer services are no longer
                 desired by your office and that I would not be reappointed, I believe it is in our best interest that I resign
                 immediately, thereby allowing earlier appointment of a replacement. That being stated, I hereby tender
                 immediate resignation as a board member on the State Board of Education and Early Development, as a
                 commissioner on the Alaska Postsecondary Education Commission and as a commissioner on the
                 Education Commission of the States.

                 Please know that I am humbled and honored by having the privilege to serve this state and the cause of
                 public education during these past years. Please also know that I firmly believe that I have made a
                 significant, positive contribution to the same.


                 Ma'am , I stand ready to be of further service to our state if ever you desire - just call.


                 Respectfully submitted,

                 Richard I Mauer, MEd, MPA
