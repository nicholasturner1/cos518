           It's state mileage .     They do not use anyone's personal mileage. Janice

           I just googled on mapquest and to drive from Washington, DC airport to The Ritz Carlton is
           140.82 miles which came out to 2 hours and 49 minutes. This would be an idea if we could
           get you and the family into DC at a good hour to then drive to PA. We will research in
           the morning and let you know all options. Remember when they purchase air reservations
           they are full fare so that if anything changes we are reimbursed. They do use state
           mileage when possible which can bring some of the airfare down. Janice

            and ak aiines flies straight through.
