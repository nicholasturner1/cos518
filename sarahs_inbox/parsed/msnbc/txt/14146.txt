                 Subject: Arctic Parliamentarians/letter of Invitation
                 Senator Murkowski's office asked me to send you the attached invitation and
                 agenda for the August meeting in Fairbanks of the Arctic Parliamentarians.

                 As you will note, the Parliamentarians would like the Governor to give the
                 welcoming remarks on August 12th. The agenda describes a number of
                 interesting issues that will be considered during the meeting.

                 When convenient, please let me know whether the Governor will participate.
