         Meg:     Totally agree with both your points here.



         Talis:

         My challenge on these points is working so closley with many who were close to the ppt
         issue and because they have so much on their plates they don't seem as enthused about
         digging deep - and they may enjoy working in the isolation provided by Juneau more than i
         do (to me, this isolated environment seems unfair to the rest of concerned Alaskans).



         Ppt investigation is hugely important and i need objective minds delving into it - we need
         new blood taking a look at this issue. We need the independent investigation.



         Its a challenge - getting to the bottom of ppt vs gross has to be tackled.

        I am a vote for independent auditors / investigators. It is important, especially with due
        caution that the process and the vote were influenced.




        Additionally, Sharon mentioned your thought of Anchorage for the special session - I can't
        imagine a better place . Perhaps the close proximity to more of the people in this state
        will help to minimize undue influence.

         email exchanges , or in person , we need to hustle on formulating plan to reassure public
         that we're on it.




         Included in this discussion needs to be PPT rate, PPT vs Gross, any violation of state
         laws in process of adoption of PPT last yr., etc.




         Thank you.




         Please be thinking about this, and consider my request to have independent
         auditors/investigators help us tackle this monumental issue.




         I will be responding to legislators in their request for special session on PPT soon. Want
         to make sure we're all on same page before responding to their call for my attention given
         to the idea of PPT Special Session. (BTW, I'm game for session on this in the fall if need
         be.)

             We are all set for an interview with the Alaska Journal of Commerce regarding agriculture
             issues, on Tuesday, May 22nd at 1:30pm in the Anchorage Governor's office.

             I will have topics / questions Friday morning. We already have the DNR briefing on ag
             issues.

             Thanks,

             Meghan,

             Thanks for working this out. It is understandable that the Governor has been preoccupied, however
             "As the world turns" the Ag Industry up here Is in disarray, if you get my drift.

             I look forward to our meeting and will forward questions to you. What timeframe should I shoot for to
             deliver something to you? I am working on trying to get an Interview with Chad Padgett at USDA but
             he has been avoiding my requests to talk to him, and need some information to make this meeting
             complete.
