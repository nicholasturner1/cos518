           I just called Russ and he said to ask Karen your question below -- that she handles that.
           I will follow up with Karen.



           NOTE: FYI, he told me that all of them - Russ, Karen, Mike T. -- were perplexed with your
           questioning of them late Friday night via email. He said there are things we have no
           control over -- like when we get the budget. They can give it to us at the same time as
           the special session and we can't do anything about it.

           First we have to make sure COS and Russ asked, gave definitive timeline, was refused by
           which lawmakers, etc. We need backup paper trail for all that be we know lyda and harris
           will claim we didn't "communicate" any of this to them.
