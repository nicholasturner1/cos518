           On Tuesday, the Governor agreed to let Melissa deVaughn shadow her while wandering the halls
           and conducting meetings, etc. in Juneau. Melissa is doing a profile of the Governor for the
           December / January issue of Alaska Magazine. Melissa will talk to her a little, but spend most of
           the time just observing re: how she works.

           Is there a time that's better than another for this - when perhaps the Governor is doing
           something? If anything needs to be "off the record," no problem. Melissa is aware and will respect
           it.

           FYI for you, Melissa 's numbers are Privileged cell and 688 -7626 home.

           Thanks,
           meg
