             Sharon/Beth- I wish the AP would have been fair in this story and asked more datails. I'd
             be happy to talk to reporters about this type of issue - or any other issue. Mayor
             Williams is the one who's cancelled mtgs on US, he's hung up on us, he followed me out of
             the AML mtg and stood there while I spoke to the two reporters yet wouldn't speak to me.
             He's the mayor who invited me to come to his house for dinner - I spike with him on a
             plane - he did not like that I told him it's tough to schedule dinners like he was
             requesting when I didn't have a calendar in front of me. We 've tried to coommunicate with
             him since that, he's refused to communicate.



             The other AML official quoted in the story has never contacted us for any mtg.



             Please take the opportunity to clarify with reporters, or if reporters want to speak with
             me on this or any other issue, send them my way please.

             It. Governor: if at all possible,        if we ' re missing any appts that are

             being requested by local officials,        can we tap into your office for

             assistance ? There are only so many hrs in the day,            we're not refusing

             anyone an opportunity to meet with me and /or third floor officials, but

             evidently some AML members don't think we're trying hard enough. I am

             canceling more internal mtgs with staff to meet with others, but

             still...   there are only so many slots in one day. Thanks

             Janice- has mayor Williams        (ketchikan)   even asked for a mtg during this

             week's visit? Has Tim Beck?



             Sharon/Beth- if u get the sense this gripe is growing legs (as my gut is

             telling me), pls respond with a stronger, proactive statement re: we DO

             rearrange scheds to make sure every mayor requesting does get a mtg.

              It's a scorcher . Mayor Williams ' complaint (and Tim Beck ' s)      that I

              won't /didn ' t spend time w/ the Mayors ... sheeeesh...



              Sharon ' s comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our

              office . That ' s our committment.



              I don ' t want this issue to grow legs ,   so whatever we have to do to make

             sure we're not double - booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that

             they're being ignored - we 'll do it.



             Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I

             have not done that and it ' d be refreshing if reporters asked for facts

             to back up complaints like that ... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug

             local officials into the schedule as best we can - even if that means

             cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches . Thanks
