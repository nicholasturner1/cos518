  Subject: Upcoming travel for the Governor
  The Governor will spend Easter weekend (April 7-8) in Juneau. On April 9 she flies to Phoenix for the
  2007 Governor's Education Symposium (Lynne Smith is also going), and returns to Juneau Friday April
  13. She'll be in Juneau April 14-17. The Governor needs to fly to Anchorage on Wed, April 18, on the
  evening flight with all three girls. They will then drive to Glennallen with First Gentleman Todd Palin the
  next day, March 19, to attend a family basketball tournament, speak to high school students, meeting
  with Elders, and community/family dinner in Glennallen. They will overnight Thursday, March 19th and
  Friday, March 20. On Saturday, April 21, they will drive to
  (Wasilla?) or Anchorage and fly home on the afternoon flight to Juneau (the Governor and the girls).
  Sunday, April 22 is the Juneau Prayer Brunch so the Governor needs to be in Juneau. On Monday, April
  23, the Governor needs to go Juno/Anch/Juno by herself-she will be attending a lunch in Anchorage,
  then she needs to return to Juneau. Mr. Palin , please let Erika and/or me know if you'll need to be added
  to any of these flights or arrangements! Thanks.
