          Governor-



          Kyle Hopkins would like 10 minutes with you tomorrow to talk about the Knik Arm Bridge. He
          spoke with Randy about where the project stands now. He would like to ask you about how
          you see the project fitting into Alaska's future. It sounds like it is a pretty long
          feature that will run this'weekend. Please let me know if I can schedule this.
