            Governor - In looking at Monday, 06.16 schedule I think we should fit in this meet/greet
            after bill signings at 1:00 p.m.



            Also, the question regarding the McNeil River Trip - I talked with Comm. Lloyd last
            evening as he was inquiring and I let him know that we would like to look at a 1 day trip
            for you.  He is going to inquire regarding the tides and if it looks feasible we can put
            you on for a 1 day or 2 day if you prefer. The others in the party can do the same or
            stay for the 4 days - just let me know and we will get this in the works. Janice
