         Hi Commissioner Monegan: if ever it's convenient for you, let's do an announcement
         introducing our DPS team to the public - those on your leadership team whom aren't well
         known yet to Alaskans, esp newer Alaskans. I think as outdoor rec and fishing season kicks
         in we should let folks know of Brown Shirts Blue Shirts personnel and plans especially.
         Thanks!

         Good to see you last night at Moose Dinner ,            Commissioner Schmidt.



         I'm anxious to hear more about the mega-prision vs regional expansion. I know we're in
         total AGIA mode, but soon will have to make decisions on the issue. Thanks for working on
         it! And we'll set up a mtg either in Juneau or Anch to go over any new info.



         Again, thanks for your good work on that and so many other issues. It's interesting to
         consider the mega prision issue in a light that can shine on hard numbers and rising
         costs.
