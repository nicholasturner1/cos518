             1. I stopped by the Air Carriers Assoc Board mtg in fbx. where they let me speak and take
             questions . They were kind and gracious , and said to pass along their thanks to you for the
             low interest loan program for pilots.



              2. Ann Ringstad of UAF wanted to say thank you to you for the way you treated UA's
             operating budget . She said it was the first time any gov she can remember treated deferred
             mtnce seriously and they appreciate it.
