        Mayor just called back. He wants a call asap, said, "you tell her I'm absolutely
        infuriated.".   Can't help but think they weren't aware that this gap wasn't going to fill
        itself in the current national climate.

            Yes I called Juneau personally.... and forgot to cc Sharon.



            Janice is printing off and handing to Mike, and Randy spoke with Mayor Williams earlier.

           Gov's office here had a call from Ketchikan Borough Mayor Joe William's office.   He wants
          to speak to the Governor asap .  I called to get some follow up and the Mayor's currently
          in a press conference on Gravina.   Their news director will give us a call or send us any
          press release , points, etc that they have which I'll forward as soon as I get.  His # is
          254-0134, but I hope to have more details shortly.
