        This just looks like more of the Republican Minority v. Democratic

        Majority talk. It's not directed at us. My guess is they are just

        finding fault wherever they can with Lyda' Majority. (Recommend we

        just stay out of it except to the extent we offer up our own

        consultants to address their questions.) Sean
