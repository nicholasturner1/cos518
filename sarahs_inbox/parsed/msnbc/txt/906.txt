 And, the governor does not ask a persons gender or race to determine whether or not they are qualified
 to serve-she never makes race an issue. This came up last year too-Rev Greene wanted specific info.

 FYI on this attachment. Leg Research requested (for an unknown requestor) the race, location, and
 gender of all of the Governors Board , Commission & Task Force appointees since she took office.

 I got this to Sharon on how to get this info out prior to the requestor sending out... and on our terms.
