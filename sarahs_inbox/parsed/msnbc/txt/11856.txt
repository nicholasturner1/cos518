             Please leave habitat permitting with DNR.



             It is a huge mistake to move it back to ADFG.



             We are a fishing community and this is going to kill all development in

             our state again.     We love ADFG, but this is moving backwards. Habitat

             permitting belongs with Natural Resources not Fish and Game. We don't

             want to go back to washing sand off rocks before placing them as rip rap.

             We are still paying huge electric bills from the millions of dollars added

             to the power creek project from overzelous ADFG habitat biologists who

             stated it was their job to "stop any project they can".



             Please don 't do it.
