               Subject: Haeg v. State Oral Arguments Reminder
               Dear Friends/Family/Guides,

              I would like to remind everyone to please attend oral arguments in the Alaska Court of
              Appeals May 8, 2008, 1:30 - 2:30 p.m. at the 5th floor courtroom of the Boney Courthouse
              building at 303 K. Street, Anchorage.

              Attorneys are flying in from the lower U.S. just to attend and at least a Section Chief of the
              U.S. Department of Justice will be there.

              Afterward (3:00 p.m.) everyone can meet at the Snow Goose Restaurant & Sleeping Lady
              Brewery 717 West 3rd Avenue Anchorage. Please let us know if you plan on attending this
              (waitress issue).

              If you need transportation from the Kenai Peninsula let us know as a couple vehicles still
              have room.

               Respectfully,

              David S. Haeg
              262-9249 phone
              398-6403 cell
