              Subject :               Army mtg


              J- An army recruiter will be in Juneau on Tuesday and wants to meet with me re : western
              region recruitung efforts.  I told one of the captains that I'd love to if I'm here at the
              same time they're here... but I am scheduled to leave sometime Tuesday.



             Sgt. Nagel is one who contacted me: Privile ed is his cell - I told him a scheduler would
             call to coordinate this mtg if it's possible. When you get a chance could you touch base
             with him to see if it would work? Maybe I'd see him at the airport even if our fits cross.



             Thanks!
