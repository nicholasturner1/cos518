              Sounds good. I can give #s of expected growth so as to be realistic, and still be
              positive.

              The headline article about slowing job growth in Alaska made me think about the lines in

              the sos related to the same topic. While you're in Bethel today, I'll take a look at that
              paragraph and see if there isn't a·different way to tackle it.



              By the way, Kate ' s excited to work with you on the ChangePoint Refresher topic. I told her
              to go for it and help out.
