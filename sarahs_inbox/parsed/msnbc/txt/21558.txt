             Ok boss , Pat and I are getting nervous that you haven ' t responded or provided any
             feedback .  If you don ' t like our approach , we can go back to the drawing board tonight.
             Tomorrow will be a busy day, though , and we want to get it in for Friday.

              I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team , and have no idea if drafts are in the
              works . So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don ' t know if
              something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




              Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
              this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
              thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.
