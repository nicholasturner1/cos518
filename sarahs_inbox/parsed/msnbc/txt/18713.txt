       Thank you so very much for all you did for the football players. I sincerely hope they
       appreciate all your efforts - I certainly do!



       Let's schedule the Juneau kids for the week of Sept 21 or Sept 28. If coaches like the
       " night before game" meals , you guys pick the Thursday and I 'll look forward it.



       Thank you!!!
