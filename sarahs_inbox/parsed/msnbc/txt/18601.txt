        Governor,




        I didn't get Kates email referred to in Tom's email. I suspect she wants a more
        agressive schedule for the State' s response to climate change.



        Currently, we are forming workgroups who are advising the subcabinet in particular areas,
        including what are the most immediate needs in terms of threats to villages and state
        infrastructure.

       I am currently on my way to Seattle for the Pacific NW Clean Seas (Oil Spill Prevention)
       conference.  I will be back in Anchorage late Friday afternoon. Please let me know if you
       would like to discuss our Climate Change actions and opportunities further. I would
       appreciate this opportunity.



       Larry

        Governor,  I thought a lot about whether I should pass this on but decided you would want
        to see what the conservation side is thinking. I don't agree with all the comments but a
        lot matches our thoughts and I respect Kate. Tom
