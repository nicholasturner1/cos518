          Somthins ' up... and I'll be patient as I wade through this and nicely get to the bottom
          of why they didn't communicate " the plan" , if there was one.

          No idea until the day you decided to go forward and Mike said " Missed opportunities,
          missed opportunities ". My general sense was that this had been going on for weeks.



          Here ' s the deal , if something had been planned for next week , why didn' t Mike just say so,
          "We have a plan for next week for this to go out?" Very simple - but I guess I'm just
          missing something here.

           I think everyone had expected the press release , op-ed and press conference would be next
          week , not this week . Randy had put together a very thorough checklist for the entire
          operation -- for next week . Oh well.



              But the real issue is why are you up so early ,           at work ? At least for me it's almost 10

            Thank you very much .      I appreciate your advice.



            I assumed everyone had their marching orders from Monday on , as the leg liason group was
           in on helping craft the press release - they were even physically in the Anchorage office
           helping with the issue before heading back to Juneau - and they seemed anxious to have all
           ducks in a row before releasin
