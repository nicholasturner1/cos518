               Karen, we thank you so much for a real "person" reply instead of the typical
               canned response. We are pleased that the supplemental does not contain
               what we feared. Please keep a "sharp eagle eye" out for any monetary
               request that has "Sterling" on it! Things locally are done generally on a "secret
               agent" basis.

               If we were in Sarah's shoes, we would VETO the supplemental budget
               because that format as we see is "strictly for dire emergencies!" It has been a
               vehicle for "vetoed pork items" as noted recently. Find us an item in the
               supplemental budget that is not pork or could be handled by private citizens?

               We have also noted in the past that expense items end up in the capital
               budget and vice-versa. We wonder if the cost accounting treats those items
               fairly as listed in that type of budgeting? If not, then all those budgets should
               be visited and "red penned" until the Legislature prepares the budgeting (with
               the help of hundreds of government accountants) that know the difference
               between "Capital and Expense" budgets and the accounting for the spending.
               The budget is a guess and the spending is the performance against the
               guess. We have also noted that things are under-funded purposely and added
               on in ensuing years, including spending without auditors notes in the annual
               audit.

              You see this day by day and we see it maybe once per year , after the audit, if
              we request the audited financial statements in printed format (CAFR).

                Dear Mr. and Mrs. Arnold - As you know, Governor Palin vetoed a $300,000 request for the Sterling
                Community Club, Inc., Sterling Community Center, in the FY08 capital budget. I have looked at the
                projects included in the bill, SB256, currently pending action in the State House of Representatives, and
                do not find that this project is included, either at $300,000 or $100,000. I recall our conversation last
                summer and appreciate your feedback. The bill is currently schedule to be heard on the House floor on

                 Dear Karen,

                Last year we were able to stop $ 100K with regard to the Sterling Community
                (Contractors) Club including a telephone call we made to you personally. We
                hope this item did not make the "supplemental budget" that the Legislature is
                fighting Sarah over. The property is full of benzene from the "Zip Mart" fuel spill
                estimated at 100K gallons. Benzene causes cancer! All it takes is a strong
                enough "spring ice heave" that breaks the black clay barrier, then the Benzene
                is on top of the ground for the children to play in. This is the kind of "nitro
                glycerin" that is at stake here ! Does the State want to deal with this type of
                potential threat?

                The Community Club is made up and run by several local contractors. Those
                folk do not represent the views of the "majority" in Sterling. "Amazing Grace"
                Merkes has been down there on the borough dime recently probably pushing
                Head Start on the condemned property. Some how Gracie was able to con the
                Denali Commission to give the Sterling Community Contractors Club $ 1 million
                to draw up building plans for the condemned site. Uncle Ted probably "ear
                marked" it! Who knows, because everything is done in secret. Too many "Secret
                Agents" in all forms of government!

                Grace and her crew held a meeting at the Seniors Center a few months ago
                with Tim Navarre moderating, a quiet meeting (little notification) and 26 showed
                up; 20 representing the contractors club and Grace's relatives that make up her
                Head Start. This whole thing stinks to high heaven! In the past years when the
                whole community voted, Gracie and her relatives and friends lost "big time." All
                the funding Amazing Grace goes after for Sterling is done in a manner secretly,
                even the process she uses on the borough assembly. You call the borough and
                no one knows about anything about proposed funding for Sterling that most of
                us are against.

                If the $ 100 K is in the supplemental, please see Sarah and squash it! We would
