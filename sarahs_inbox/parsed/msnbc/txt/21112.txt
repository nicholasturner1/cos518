          Sharon- the correction Kizzia should make in his stories today is that Ken Jacobus,
          Wasilla City Attorney (at the time), was hired by the Wasilla City Council to represent
          the city - it's the council's job to interview, hire and fire the city's attorney and city
          clerk.
