                 Everyone,
                 The energy issue is going to attract a tremendous amount of debate and attention once the legislature
                 turns to the issue , which will be next week. In the meantime there has been a regular stream of sidebar
                 meetings on the issue . In a nutshell there is no consensus position on what we should with the
                 Governor's $1200 rebate and her PCE proposal.

                 I've been meeting with both urban and rural legislators every day. If you followed the House C&RA
                 meeting this morning you would quickly understand why some legislators are saying the energy issue
                 might be dicier than the gasline proposal.

                 I'm doing everything I possibly can to push the issue of short term relief. Bush Alaska needs it to
                 survive the winter. I've been talking with everyone : republicans and democrats alike. Let me also say
                 that we're dam fortunate to have Lyman as Co-Chair of Senate Finance. The other plus is the
                 Fairbanks delegation is fully engaged.

                 The issue is code red for Bush Alaska. I appreciate BBNC's (and everyone else's) efforts to step up
                 and make a difference for the region.

                 Bryce

                FYI
                Donald Nielsen writes: (Letter sent to April @BBNC 7/14)
                  I'm sorry I wasn't aware of the summit that was held in Dillingham. I
                  am assuming that villages with concerns such as South Naknek with
                  its current energy crisis should go through BBNC to ensure we speak
                  with a collective voice to address our current crisis . If so, are you
                  the contact person?

                  If this is the case , South Naknek Village Council communicated to
                  governor Palin in late June and early July that her $1200 .00 proposal
                  does not come close to helping anyone in village Alaska nor does
                  dropping the taxes at the gas pump . We have calculated for South
                  Naknek, the current cost for heating , fuel, electricity, water & sewer
                  and gasoline will cost each household approximately $18000 to
                  $20000 for the coming year. This high cost for energy does not
                  address all other annual vital needs such as food, etc.

                  Our current heating fuel cost is $6.50 per gallon , we are not sure
                  what the increase will be when our fall fuel barge arrives. I'm sure
                  an additional $1 will be added. Electricity water and sewer are
                  attached to high fuel cost . Gasoline is near $8 and rising. There is
                  no doubt fuel cost in the upriver, lake area and the Peninsula
                  villages will experience even higher costs.

                  This crisis is immediate and if not addressed before mid Sept. (when
                  the fuel barges stop running), the costs will even be higher, that is if
                  anyone could afford it. There is not a family here that can afford the
                  current prices. So between now and the end of August what are the
                  plans? I do not see anything concrete that would help our
                  immediate needs.

                  All of the other items discussed are important and needed , however
                  more long term in nature and should be pursued regardless. Our
                  immediate concern is the here and the now . Families are worried
                  about where to find the money for the next 50 gallons of heating fuel
                  and where do they find the next 5 gallons of gas to pick their net.
                  This issue alone is where the state needs hard hitting now. Unless
                  the state addresses the current crisis regarding high energy costs,
                  all of the other items discussed at the summit will not matter.

                  Village people will be forced from their villages come Sept. if the
                  state does not step forward and help now. Out migration has been
                  accelerated the past couple of years with the high cost of living
                  and villagers are now getting desperate.

                  Fish base prices are 12 cents per pound less than last year. Bay
                  Watch paid their fishermen off with 50 cents a pound , and they are
                  generally the highest paying processor in the Naknek River.
                  Since BBNC has taken the lead role to address the energy crisis I am
                  hoping my statements can be included and pursued along with
                  everyone else's. I'm not sure if other villages are aware of BBNC's
                  lead roll on these issues . Have they been contacted ? Has there
                  been discussions with the Governor or Staff? The Governor needs to
                  get on board immediate/y, as does Bryce about our immediate
                  energy crisis. There is no time to waste. Everyday counts. Please
                  keep me informed. Thank you very much for your efforts.
