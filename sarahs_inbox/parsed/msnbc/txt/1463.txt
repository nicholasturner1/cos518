                           like to include them in his production on Bristol Bay's Commercial Salmon
                           Fishing. They could also talk briefly about Alaska and fishing in general as a
                           passion and a part of their life style.

              Comments: Crome - I don't know the Governor's plans for these dates. It is not worth a special
                        trip. This is a pretty low profile TV show that airs on the Great American Country
                        channel. But if she's out there anyway it would be worth doing. Also, I don't know
                        of any grant funds available of the type he's looking for.
