             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the birth of your son, Trig. If you think you're in the spot light now
             as Governor , just wait till the public gets to know your son as he grows up!



             I'm glad you voiced your blessings...



             Sincerely,

             "Very happy family with 9 year old daughter who steels light regularly,"

             Stokes, Kimberly, Harrison and Frances Ann Smith
