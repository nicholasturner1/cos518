             Governor,

             A quick update:



             House Finance: "Session has been tentatively scheduled on Saturday, November 10th, at
             6:00 p.m.   The starting time is dependent on the time House Finance adjourns and on how
             much time the drafters will need to complete the Finance Committee Substitute. The plan
             is to have HB 2001 in second reading on Saturday." Rep. Chenault's committee substitute
             will include the 25% rate and the ACES original progressivity. We are optimistic that the
             committee will amend it to have higher progressivity and restore many of the other ACES
             provisions we want to have in the final bill. It's looking like the House version will
             pass first.



             Senate Finance:  Introduction of committee substitute bill scheduled for Saturday,
             November 10, 1:30 p.m. We are less optimistic that what comes out of this committee will
             include our provisions, but are fairly confident we have the votes on the floor to correct
             that problem.



            To summarize , we are in relatively good shape right now and believe we have some positive
            momentum.  I spoke with Mike and Joe this morning about possibly having you make further
            phone calls, but we don't have any specifics yet. We will keep you updated on significant
            events.



                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSPO1_0007707
