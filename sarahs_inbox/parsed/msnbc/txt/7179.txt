              Subject: phone numbers for Sharon and Richard

            Governor,

            Sharon Illsley (KNI district court ) can be reached at Privile a Richard Postma (Anchorage District Court) can be
            reached at 269-5156.

            I will call the unsuccessful nominees, contact Chief Justice Fabe, and let the press office know to send out the
            release when I know you've officially appointed these folks. I passed this information on to Gary Wheeler as well.

            Thanks so much,


            Ivy Frye
