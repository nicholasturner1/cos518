Hello Governor Palin,



I am a UAS student and a work-from-home mother in Ketchikan. I really appreciate the amazing
example you set by keeping your son with you while you continue to work. To thank you for this, I
would like to give you one of the silk ring slings I make to carry your little boy in. Do you have a color
preference? Would this gift be acceptable?



Thank you,



Dawn Schlosser
