  Hi Todd,

  Hope things are going well for you up North; sorry to hear that traveling this weekend was a
  problem/challenge for you and your family.

  The Governor had mentioned that you'd be in Jnu. during the time she's in Phoenix (Education Summit).
  Her calendar shows that she's leaving Monday, April 8th and returning Thursday April 13th (The calendar
  didn't list times/fits. yet). I can re-book your tickets, if you'd like- just let me know what works with your
  schedule.

  If you are here- it would be a good week to have the Foundation luncheon, as it would give them at least
  one weeks notice to attend. Anytime would work.... or we could just schedule it for Thursday, April 12th
  11:00-1:00pm. It would give you the earlier part of the week to get some things done before we meet with
  the members. I could email invitations today or tomorrow- whatever you decide, works for us at the
  House. The only thing so far- that's scheduled at the House that week (4/9-4/13) is World Wide
  Technologies, they will be installing the new phone system.

  Thanks!
  Erika
