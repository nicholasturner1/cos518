                This is just to show I submitted this letter to the editor yesterday, and it may not be published,
                but, I thought you might like it. Please give my regards to Sarah Palin, by saying "A baby's
                entrance into the earth makes it renewed in innocence." Said by a great church leader. Please
                give a copy of this and the last email into the hands of Sarah, I know she would appreciate "a
                little" freshness, despite all the hectic hecticness of all things in the political arena. It doesn't hurt
                to give it into her hands, it's just a little thing. Thx.
