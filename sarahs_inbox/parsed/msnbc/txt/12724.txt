            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov .   Palin,




            Congratulations on your pregnancy.



            A former Alaska resident, I was inspired to check your biography after reading the news.
            Your name sounded awfully familiar, and I was trying to determine if you were the mayor of
            Wasilla whileI was in Anchorage, in the late 1990s. Surprisingly, your official biography
            is rather vague on this. May I suggest you have your Web people fill in these details?
            Others may want to know, especially if you end up as McCain's running mate!



            Thanks and regards,

            Gary Kirchherr
