              Tara and just went and grabbed some dinner before she went to the airport. we both toasted
              to your success!  We got to talking about the last year and are just both amazed at your
              accomplishments, leadership, and how you've brought so many of us together. I mean, tara
              will be a lifelong friend I'm bonded to b/c of your campaign. Same w kris and frank, your
              girls and parents. Anyway, we're very proud of all you've done this last year-beating 2
              governors, ethics reform, agia, aces-just to name a few! This is a very
              important/historic/monumental time in

              Alaska and I'm proud to be a small part of it b/c of you. I remember my first fundraiser
              of yours-nov 2005 at joanne and dorwin's place on the hwy and still can't wrap my mind
              around how all of our lives have changed since then. I know you're modest and way too
              humble to agree with me, but it's the truth!

              Have a safe trip home. Tell my favorite girls I say hi. And, take some time to enjoy this!
              As always- you're awesome.

              Ivy
