        Good morning.



        Was this letter sent to our Senator yet? You can use signature machine to finalize and fax
        to DC, followed by mailed hard copy.



        Thank you!

        Subject: Senator Stevens/Congratulatory Letter



        In view of the attached article from Congressional Quarterly, I thought that you might
        want to write a short congratulatory note to Senator Stevens. So, I've drafted the
        following for your consideration:



        Dear Senator Stevens,



        I read with interest the Congressional Quarterly article about your longevity in the US
        Senate.  Congratulations on becoming the longest-serving Republican Senator in the history
        of the Senate and on your status as the seventh longest serving Senator ever.



       Your longevity is admirable on its own merits, but what you have done with that tenure is
       even more impressive.  Your mastery of a broad spectrum of issues and your important
       leadership role in the Senate have greatly benefitted the people of Alaska and the nation.
       Alaska is a much finer place because of your almost 13,990 days in the Senate.

                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSPO1_O0O1O38

         I look forward to continuing our work together in behalf of the people of Alaska and to
         learning from your fine example of dedicated public service.



         Sincerely,



         Governor , I hope you ' re doing well .   We haven't talked in a while, but I think things are
         going pretty well on the DC front.




         Please note that my email address has changed . My new email address is
