          Janice- I still seem to be way behind in getting accurate emails and contact info into my
          blackberries.

            I call Sharon, I get Mark Kelsey; I email LeDoux, I get a kodiak school district old
          account; I don't have Deputy #s plugged in (like Glass), etc. This week let's have
          delegated to one of the Juneau receptionists that task and she can make sure they're all
          plugged in.
