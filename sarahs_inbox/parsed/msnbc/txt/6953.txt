            I called Bill to let him know he would be removed from the Council. He said, "good."

            In looking at the fact sheet, this council is under the Office of the Governor.

            However, commissioners serve on that council so I'll get w/Ivy on notification; etc.

           Meg: we'll obviously want a press release citing our removing Bill from his state service.

           Kris - pls let the commissioner who would hold the umbrella over this council know of my action in
           removing Bill.

             Kris is right. Bill is a member of the AK-Alberta Bilateral Council . This board serves at the governor's
             pleasure. I will draft the letter of removal now and also contact him, and send an electronic copy of the
             letter to the press office.

             Thanks,

             Ivy

             yes - pls follow up with Linda or have someone do follow up for you.
             pls work with ivy to remove bill from any and all B & C's he's on.
             pls work with Gary/Bob at Security, as I was told by a security person yesterday that bill allen
             did travel with Murkowski - don't know how many times, but they'll know.

             Ivy - we'll ask Meg to do a presser today on removing bill allen from B & C service.
             Kris - pis CC-in Frank Bailey on these issues, thanks.

               I just learned that Bill Allen has served , and still serves, on the Alaska-Alberta Bilateral Council.
               This council is under the purview of Boards & Commissions. In that capacity , Bill Allen (and also
               Rick Smith) attended the working group meeting in Edmonton in May of 2004. Murkowski
               attended as well as Greg Renkes and a number of other state officials. I have a list of attendees
               that I'll be faxing to Kari. The next working group meeting was in March of 2006 in Juneau.
               Both Bill Allen and Rick Smith attended . I will fax a copy of that agenda and participants as
               well.

               In November of 2004 , Bill Allen attended the Council of State Governments trip to Thailand with
               Murkowski, Mrs. Murkowski and Margy Johnson . Murkowski was president of CSG at the time.
               Veco sponsored the trip for $ 15,000. Documentation will be faxed . Following the CSG trip to
               Thailand , they all traveled to Taiwan.

               Linda Perez should have further details on expenditures, etc. or any domestic travel . Please let
               me know if you'd like me to follow-up with her.

               Kari - would you document for me the times Bill Allen accompanied Murkowski and/or
               Clark on trips, incl the international travel(s) - some of these also included Margy
               Johnson.

               It will be necessary for you to ask other commissioners/staff for info on this.

               Kris may be able to get some of that info with you. Thank you
