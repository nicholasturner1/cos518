 Todd - In going over scheduling yesterday - This invitation was for the Governor to attend the North
 American Outdoor Institute - Oct. 19 -21, 2007. For two days Alaskans will be able to learn from the
 professionals that provide emergency services in the backcountry and at the ski resorts, etc. The
 Governor will be unavailable and wondered if you would be attending any of these events. This is @
 Kincaid Park. The request came from Debra McGhan of Wasilla.
