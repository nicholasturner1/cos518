            Dear Kari,

            Today my husband and I are driving to Haines , where we will board the Alaska ferry for our trip to Governors
            State University , where I will officially become president on July 1.

            I want to be sure that Governor Palin has my new contact information . She had indicated that she would like to
            speak with me about higher education in Alaska , and I am ready at any time to talk with the Governor . I certainly
            realize that she has been especially busy lately.

            My new e-mail address is E-Maimon©govst .edu. My new cell phone is : Privileged or
            When the ferry reaches Bellingham, WA, we will begin our drive across the country . I will have my cell phone on
            whenever we are in range. So the Governor is free to call or e-mail at any time.

            Please convey to the Governor my best wishes for her continued success in leading Alaska , a state that will
            always be in our hearts.

            Best wishes,

            Elaine

            Elaine P . Maimon, Ph.D.
            President-designate, Governors State University
