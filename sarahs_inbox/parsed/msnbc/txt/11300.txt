             what was the quote emailed from Sharon? What Russ said yesterday was fine tho we'll be
            expected to say more soon. I agree with Doogan. He doesn't deserve to be caught off-guard,
            he gets enough of that within.

               By SEAN COCKERHAM

               scockerham@adn.com



               (01/19 / 08 04 : 21:36)

               JUNEAU -- The war over oil taxes was rekindled Friday with a bill that

               would roll back parts of the multibillion- dollar tax increase on the

               North Slope oil companies that the Legislature passed only two months

               ago.

               Senate Resources Committee Chairman Charlie Huggins sponsored the bill.

               It would reverse the Legislature' s decision in the November special

               session to make the oil tax hike retroactive to June 30.

               It also would abolish the limit on how much oil         companies can deduct

               from their tax bill for operating costs at the Prudhoe and Kuparuk

               fields . Those are the two biggest and oldest North Slope oil fields.

               Huggins said putting a cap on deductions was never studied in Senate

               committees before it became part of the bill. And making the tax

               increase retroactive to June 30 wasn ' t fair ,      the Wasilla Republican

               said.

               "If I was an IRS man and said I was going to make a retroactive tax

               provision for you and your neighbors and everybody else in the United

               States ,   you would not be too happy,"   Huggins said .   "For us to just

               summarily do that in Juneau to one of our business partners is a

               questionable process ." His bill would make the tax effective on Jan. 1,

               2008.

              Anchorage Democratic Rep. Les Gara said reversing the retroactive part

               of the tax would cost the state about $600 million.

               "I don't think giving state money back to oil companies who are making

               record profits is the way to go," Gara said.

              Anchorage Democratic Sen. Hollis French pledged to fight Huggins' SB

               242. French said he expects it's going to be contentious.

               "My first thought was, here we go again," said French .        "I'd hoped we had

               finished that debate and put it behind us."

              The limit on how much the oil companies can deduct from their tax bill

                                                                6

               was a huge issue for Democrats in the November special session on oil

               taxes.

               They managed to amend the tax to cap the growth in operation - expense

               deduction at Prudhoe and Kuparuk to no more than 3 percent a year.

               Many Democrats said they would never have voted for the oil tax without

               the cap on how much companies can deduct . One problem with the previous

               tax was that it wasn ' t bringing in nearly as much money as the state

               thought it would because of rising deductions , they said.

               Democrats called the cap a compromise that let them accept an oil tax on

               profits.

               Many really wanted a tax on the gross value of the oil -- which they

               argued would be less vulnerable to manipulation by sharp oil company

               accountants claiming deductions from their state tax bills.

               The cap on deductions is to go away after three years unless renewed.

               That's a sign lawmakers aren ' t comfortable with it , Huggins said, and

               are worried about what it is going to do to oil production in the state.



               FAST TRACK

               Senate President Lyda Green sent the bill to only one committee . That's

               an indication she doesn ' t want it held up . The bill is going only to the

               Senate Finance Committee , where Sitka Republican Sen. Bert Stedman said

               that he'll hold hearings on it.

               The Senate passed the oil tax hike in the November special session over

               the objection of majority Republicans including Green, Huggins and

               Stedman . An alliance between Democrats in the bipartisan Senate majority

               and Republicans in the minority caucus got the tax through.

               The all - Republican minority had tried to keep the tax from being

               retroactive . So they could have sympathy for Huggins ' s attempt to roll

               that back.

               Senate Minority Leader Gene Therriault said he's surprised, though, that

               Republicans in the majority want to change the oil tax again so soon.

               Part of the argument in November against raising oil taxes too often was

               that it creates an unstable business climate , Therriault said.

               State House Speaker John Harris , R-Valdez ,   supported the oil tax
                                                              7

               increase but did not like the fact it was retroactive. Harris said he'd

               consider Huggins' bill if it can make it out of the Senate but does not

               know how he'd vote on it.

               PALIN SURPRISED

               Gov. Sarah Palin was the one who proposed the oil tax increase. Palin

               administration officials were surprised to learn of Huggins' bill on

               Friday.

               "I think it would be something that would inspire a lot of internal

               discussion," said Russ Kelly, the governor's legislative director.

               The oil company BP had a cautious reaction to the proposal to get rid of

               the retroactivity and the limit on how much it can deduct.

               "These are two elements of the (oil) tax bill that concerned us very

               much," said BP spokesman Steve Rinehart .   " But we are still assessing

               Senator Huggins' legislation."
