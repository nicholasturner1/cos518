            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,



           I am a Christian, wife of a retired military officer, Mom, former public school teacher &
           currently home school our three children. I have been a resident of MN, ND, AZ, & NY. I
           KNOW firsthand the effects of illegal immigrants on safety (I was almost assaulted by
           illegal farm workers while I was in college), had them try to break into my house in AZ,
           saw them overrun the schools & clinics in AZ. I also saw what BIG government did to nice
           places in upstate NY. Please tell me that you do not support John McCain & his amnesty
           ways.  It is anti-American that we as Christians cannot be heard because of
           McCain/Feingold prior to elections when such matters need to be fresh in people's minds.
           Huckabee may have been a pastor, but he certainly does not seem to be conservative either
           in many ways.  Yet, the news reports you as saying you would like to speak to McCain &
           Huckabee, what about Mitt Romney? Though I do not see eye to eye w/ Romney on everything
           including his religious affiliati

           on, but he is pro-life & he is strong on immigration & the economy. The most CONSERVATIVE
           candidate still in the race. I wish the others were as concerned about reaching the
           conservatives in their party as they are about embracing the democrat agenda. I hope you
           read this as well as the attached link & I would appreciate a repsonse.



           Sincerely, Karen Bembenek
