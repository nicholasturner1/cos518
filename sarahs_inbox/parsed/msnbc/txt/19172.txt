        Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
        that the state thanks them for their service and now i s time i s overdue) to move on.



        What process are you, as COS, usin to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
        hands (I spoke with Emil about Privile  yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
        Leo about Privileged .. I'll cc t em in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
        the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



        I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
        ended . If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
        overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Mato
       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


        Thanks
