         I met with your special assistants today to talk to them about the boards that fall under
         their departments and any suggestions they have.for good people they met throughout the
         session that would be good board members. I asked questions based on character,
         background, the way they felt the direction of the administration was going, where they
         work, the issue(s) they were talking to the special assistants about, etc.   They provided
         a lot of helpful information and gave me some good names of people to consider for some of
         the technical seats we've been trying to fill (ie: doctors, attorneys, archeologists,
         consumer/provider).  I will vet the names and bring you guys a final list for your
         consideration.



        I also sent an email to Kris (Perry) for her thoughts on people that we need to get
        plugged in.  I hope to touch base with her soon to share some thoughts.



         Thanks.    I hope Fairbanks was successful.
