            Steve is still out doing townhall meetings this week. Since we haven't heard from him
            yet, I assume he is out of range. If we still have not heard from him when the presser is
            scheduled to begin, I will attend.

            Someone from our office needs to be there and let them know we are there... in case they
            have need for our clarifications. Let me know who'll represent us there. Thanks. Also tp
            remind them of Stevens positive words about our plan that he shared again today at Export
            Luncheon.
