         Not sure if anyone else has replied to you yet on this. While i too am concerned about
         leaks and trust, this was one that became known on Friday. Chris. was notified on Thursday
         and had an interview in Anchorage on Friday. They accepted and Mike announced the new
         structure at staff mtg on Friday. I apologize for the apparent disconnect in
         communication.

         Wonder how the Bitney replacement mention already got in the 'Ear.



         Sheeeesh- I can trust people in this business as far as I can throw them. Have the two
         even been officially offered, and accepted, the jobs yet?



         Reading the 'Ear today was another lesson for me that nothing is considered confidential
         to some folks, so fewer and fewer people should be brought in to "think out loud" re:
         admin business.
