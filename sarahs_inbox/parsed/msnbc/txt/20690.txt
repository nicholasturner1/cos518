              We are so proud of you. All of Alaska is so proud of you. You hit that speech out of the ballpark - with only one
              hour to rehearse it? It was surreal for us as your staff to watch you on TV on stage with Sen. McCain ... like an
              out of body experience . We were in tears. God bless.

              Subject: Governor's web page unscheduled service interruption




              The Enterprise Technology Services Help Center has been advised of a
              service interruption to the Office of the Governor's web page.
              This service interruption affects any person attempting to connect to the Office of the Governor's web
              site.
              Technicians are working towards resolving this problem, related to an extremely high volume of traffic
              due to the recent announcement of Governor Sarah Palin's selection to be the Vice Presidential running
              mate of John McCain.
              Duration of the interruption at this time is unknown.

              If you have questions, please call the State of Alaska Service Center at
              1-888-565-8680 and press option 4 for the ETS Help Center.
