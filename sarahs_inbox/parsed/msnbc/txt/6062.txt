          Since Bitney obviously didn't communicate with Legislators as my leg liason through this -
          pis call Hollis as Sean suggests. I also got calls last night from folks (even a city
          official) that some of the items we kept in the budget were NOT their city's priority -
          yet we cut things they had worked on as "highest priority" with their legislators. We
          didn't get the word thru the Leg Liason office what those were.



          Also, Rep Nueman is trying to stir things up about us with budget cuts - he went right to
          the movers and shakers to bad mouth the vetoes, I'm told.

         Just a few tweaks in an otherwise good budget release.
