           Dear Governor Palin;




           My wife and I recently had the opportunity to visit your great state. We set sail on
           08/08/08 and returned on 08/16/08. We took the inside passage with Celebrity cruise lines.
           Your state is amazing. Wildlife, mountains, Glaziers, scenery, etc. We found the people to
           be very polite and caring.




                                                                1
