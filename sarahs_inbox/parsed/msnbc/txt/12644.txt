            There is only a very select few I completely trust also. From what we experienced I am
            sure the tentacles of history, money and power reach too far. Thank God things are
            changing.  We just need to keep praying for wisdom to do things right. We have lots of
            energy to correct this, also our heads are thick - banging them on the wall doesn't seem
            to hurt :)



           Don't forget - we are here because of you!                 God bless. Tom

           Tom: an aside- but surely Clark's plea vindicates us with oil/gas efforts? We inherited
           such a clustered up tainted, corrupt mess. It's such a gross thing to consider that this
           recent revelation is probably just the tip of the ice berg re: Clark and Murky's
           activities. I just read a list of Murky's campaign fundraisers/treasurers... The list
           itself tells such a story.



           The list speaks to other tainted issues like CON, fisheries and ethics reform efforts and
           why we feel we're beating our heads against the wall some days. It also makes one even
           more curious about the motivation of some of the Mukry hanger-on-ers in Juneau... many
           whom I still don't know well enough to be able to trust.



           Just thinking out loud - and sharing with you how much I appreciate all of you and your
           kick butt work for Alaska!!!

              I'm delayed again in Seattle - the coonecting flt's already gone . Won't get in til 8
            tonight , via milk run . Checking on other options , perhaps flying to Anchorage instead of
            waiting here til 3pm to try to get a seat on that next Juneau flt.



             Pls announce Steve anyway today . Have him say a few words after an intro by any DNR
           folks who may be available ? If no one ' s around then wait til tomorrow, tho I hate for
           press to know I was out of town for a day and couldnt get back in time for scheduled
           Juneau committments.
