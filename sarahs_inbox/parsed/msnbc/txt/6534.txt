           Dear Mr. Hogan,



           It has now been over three weeks since I contacted you about this problem

           with licensing, and have not heard back from you. Since then employee V.C.

           clearance came in and it took 38 days. Still waiting for the results of two

           other employees, submitted on 7/19/07 and 7/31/07. We are critical on staff

           due to the failure of the state to provide timely clearances. I feel you

           have had enough time to address this problem and haven't. if we can not get

           any resolutions by friday, 8/17/07, I intend to file a complaint with the

           state ombudsman's office. I'm sorry to have to go this route but our

           residents are suffering because of your departments failure to do their job.



           Sincerely,



          Mark Arnold
