                Couple of things went into consideration here.

                First, our core supporters are fine, but that count only gets us to 10. We have amendments to worry about
                and possibly the effective date. Some of the folks on the edges asked if we could get letters to the editor
                and emails coming. This action alert was supposed to help drive emails and phone calls. There is a
                seperate track for letters to the editor.

                Second, the list this was sent to is the newsletter list. It is far fewer in number than the business license
                list and its been in circulation for some time. People who don't want to be on it have probably let us know
                and been removed. I will verify whether it is an opt in or opt out system in the morning and be sure to
                stress that with press in the am.

                Third, our solid supporters in the majority may not have a majority of their caucus...its close. They are not
                of a mind to push very hard without some cover. They need to be able to point to some outside forces if
                they are going to push against their leadership. Our only apparent ally within the leadership is Gary
                Stevens, and he's not exactly known for his fortitude.

                Finally, I want to apologize to Mike, Kelly, and particularly to the Governor. I should have talked directly to
                each of you and did not That's not team play and there may have been different judgements by each of
                you given these considerations. I didn't give you that opportunity and that wasn't fair. I am sorry.

                We took heat before for using this tactic even though it was my idea. I thought things were looking
                promising for the senate to pass AGIA. Seems like a desperation move. Will Leggies feel too much
                pressured about this. Think this was necessary? Hope it does not back fire.

                                LEGISLATIVE ALERT- CALL YOUR ALASKA SENATOR TODAY!


                     Top 10 Reasons to Vote "Yes" on Authorization to Issue the AGIA License to
                          TransCanada Alaska Company , LLC and Foothills Pipe Lines, Ltd.

                 1. TransCanada Alaska Company, LLC ('TC Alaska") and its parent corporation , TransCanada
                    Corporation , are high-quality companies in the business of building and operating natural gas
                    pipelines throughout North America.

                 2. Through an AGIA license , TC Alaska makes legally enforceable commitments to:
                       . Hire Alaskans;
                       . Meet in-state energy needs;
                       . Adhere to a firm timeline for project development all the way through FERC certification;
                          and
                       . Reduce tariffs and increase expansion opportunities that encourage exploration and
                          development of the North Slope gas basin , which provide the basis for long-term careers,
                          economic security and energy security for Alaskans.

                 3. If TC Alaska violates any legally enforceable commitments made under the AGIA license,
                     consequences include recoupment of state reimbursements made under AGIA and state
                     acquisition of project data acquired by TC Alaska during the license term.

                 4. TC Alaska offers a project that is economically and technically viable, and that maximizes
                    benefits to Alaskans.

                 5. TC Alaska faces fewer permitting obstacles in Canada , and, as an independent pipeline
                    company, does not raise the antitrust legal issues that might affect a producer-owned gas
                    pipeline.

                 6. Award of an AGIA license to TC Alaska provides the opportunity to bring all parties together while
                    still protecting Alaska's interests.

                 7. Award of an AGIA license does not commit the state to anything more than the inducements
                    specified in the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act:
                        . Up to $500 million reimbursement for qualified expenditures;
                        . Benefits of an AGIA coordinator and expedited state permit review;
                       . Exclusive enjoyment of the AGIA inducements prior to the commencement of commercial
                           operation.

                 8. Award of an AGIA license to TC Alaska allows the state to assist smaller pipeline projects that
                    can provide gas for instate needs or spur line projects off the AGIA mainline.

                 9. A gas pipeline company owned by major North Slope oil and gas producers, and that is not
                    licensed under AGIA, may be subject to management decisions that reflect the best interests of

                     the owners, rather than the pipeline company. For example, the gas pipeline company may
                     benefit from expanding the pipeline, but if such an expansion competes with producers ' interests,
                     the producer-owners may not allow the expansion.

                10. Without authorization to issue the AGIA license to TC Alaska, Alaska will once again be
                    dependent on the major North Slope producers for pipeline development and that means:
                       . Project development on the producers ' timeline that fits with their worldwide plans;
                       . Negotiations on fiscal concessions with the producers holding most of the cards; and
                       . Far fewer tools to protect Alaska 's interests or to develop Alaska's natural gas resources in
                          a way that maximizes benefits to Alaskans.


                   Call your Alaska State Senator TODAY and urge him or her to vote YES to award the state
                                                    license to TransCanada.
