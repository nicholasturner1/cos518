                I will emphasize to the Senator that the Administration is very much on board
                with in-state use and also our plan for using petroleum revenues to address
                short term needs, particularly those related to energy costs.

                I think this is all we may need to do for now. In honesty, messages from the
                gas team have not registered well with the Senator although this may change
                in the aftermath of your recent meeting with him.

               When I wrote you earlier, I was unaware of the Senator's plans - and he did
               not mention them - to talk publicly on July 2nd and 3rd about his initiatives
               to "bring short and long-term energy relief to Alaskans." (See below). His
               original idea was to use your initiatives and the second special session to
               show Congress how petroleum revenues could be used at the federal level.

               Perhaps, we should postpone a definitive response to the Senator until we see
               what transpires tomorrow. In the meantime, I can convey your thoughts
               about in-state use, etc and see how he responds.

               Does this sound like a plan?

                  Does he realize we are very supportive of instate also and I've asked the AGIA team to ramp up
                  that message publicly, as I fear that message was lost through the revealing of the TC-Alaska "big
                  line" plan? Marty could provide the Senator more infomation on precisely what we're doing to
                  ensure in-state use and benefits of our gas. (I'd hope his testimony would acknowledge that we're
                  on the same page with in-state.)
                    Also, hopefully he could weave in that our Surplus Revenue Return proposal shows how oil/gas
                  revenue DOES help ourselves as we attempt to relieve burdens on AK residents by returning
                  surplus dollars to them to help meet the rising cost of living - it's a short term plan as we work
                  towards conservation and long term energy relief plans.

                  Subject: Senator Stevens/Second Special Session

                  Senator Stevens contacted me last night to find out what you would think about his testifying at the
                  special session on in-state energy issues.

                  He does support an in-state solution. However, his primary objective would be to show the
                  Congress how state oil revenues can be used to benefit the citizenry. He believes that the second
                  special session will exemplify how opening ANWR and offshore areas in Alaska would provide
                  significant non-tax revenues to the U.S. Treasury, thereby benefitting the economy in several ways.

                  For whatever it's worth, I believe that this is a good idea. I'm not sure that anything will budge the
                  Democratic Leadership in Congress, but the publicity should help keep the spotlight on Alaska's oil
                  and gas resources.

                  I think that the ultimate decision about his testifying must be made by the Legislature. However,
                  the Senator didn't want to proceed without your approval. My guess is that the beneficial electoral
                  implications are not lost on the Senator, either.

                  I also mentioned to him that we would probably respond to Dan Fagan's Sunday column, which I
                  characterized as beyond fair criticism of a politician in a situation where Fagan had previously been.
                  apprized of the facts.

                  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

                     Engaging the Private Sector Is Key to Solving the Energy Challenge

                                      A global energy summit held June 22 in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia, underscored the essential
                                      role of international cooperation in meeting global energy demand . The summit also
                                      highlighted the importance of the private sector in securing energy for the growing global
                                      economy.

                                     The fact that business interests were even invited to the summit which included
                     representatives from 38 countries and many international energy organizations -demonstrates progress.
                     The U .S. Chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy , led by General Jim Jones , was in Jeddah and
                     played a key role in fostering discussion between government and business.

                                                                                                        >> Join the conversation.
