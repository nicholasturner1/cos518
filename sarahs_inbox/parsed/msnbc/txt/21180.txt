         Original fit was just pushed back again so there's no way to make any connection. We have
         to take a different airline and may get in at 2AM. My main concern is missing any of the
         mtgs we've scheduled for tomorrow, inlc the Fairbanks town hall mtg. I may have to stay in
         Anchorage tonight if we dont lv the airport agter getting our luggage around 2:30 or 3AM.

         I'll let Linda know. I believe Bob is talking with the troopers in NY on new flight
         arrangements/solutions.  Please let me know if I can do anything.

        They may need a new purchase of tickets be these fits are all messed up with weather. And
        i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pis let
        linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
        fairbanks.

         Your connection will be 30 minutes    - enough time to make flight .        If you change, not arrive
         til 2 am
