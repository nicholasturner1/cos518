               Governor.

               In the Los Angeles Times science section is an article on fishing quotas . The story itself Is somewhat old news,
               but the conclusion to the article is amusing (see link and excerpt below regarding your apparent work experience
               at the Alyeska Seafood processing plant in Dutch Harbor a few years ago).


               http·//www latimescorn/news/science/la-na-fish19-2008sep19 0.5053095 std

              Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, now the Republican Party's vice presidential nominee, worked in Alyeska's
              plant for three weeks in 1987 at the end of her collegiate years.

              "I'm honored to confirm that the governor once worked at this plant," Wilt said. "She was only here
              three weeks. She knows hard work and she's eligible for rehire if her current prospects don't work out."

              Take care, DL.
