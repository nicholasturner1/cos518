             Larry was in the meeting - can you play slueth with him and confidentially feel him out
             re: how this works - why would and how would staffers there leak to Halcro exact quotes
             and sentiments from the mtg? Or is his buddy Halcro lying? (Halcro told me once Larry is
             part of his three-person inner circle - that was during campaign)
