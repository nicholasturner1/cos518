            Mike - we didn't get to finish our conversation on Nancy ' s bill re : firefighters . I haven't
            acted on it , but I don't oppose it . Haven ' t seen a fiscal note on it , but if Nancy asks
            for our help on it I will help her out.



            Also, anyone know why Meyer and Chenault still won't schedule the CON bill? I tried
            calling both offices this evening but it was after hours. I'll try again tomorrow so that
            I'm on record, again, as asking for hearings and action on the measure . I'm still 100-
            percent committed to repeal, and am perplexed and disappointed with their lack of
            progress.
