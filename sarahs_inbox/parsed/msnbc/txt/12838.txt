            Thank you so much Tom. I'm very thankful for you and the team you've put together. God's
            got all this in control as we give it up to Him! Bless you and Sharon and the kids.

            I was just listening to the news about the NY governor. It started me thinking about the
            trip to Barrow, the FBI letting you know about the legis's arrests, and about your
            comments on how we have such a responsibility to do things right.



             Wanted to let you know that I was praising the Lord for you and asking Him to bless to
            richly.  God bless.  Tom
