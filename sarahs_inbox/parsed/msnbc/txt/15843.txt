          MESSAGE:

          Governor...I saw you on the Glenn Beck program the other night and was very impressed by
          your sensitivity to the direction of our country especially concerning the reserves which
          your beautiful state possesses .... I know that you are doing a wonderful job in Alaska;
          however, I encourage you to keep open the possibility of serving our great country in a
          ."NATIONAL" position .... WE THE PEOPLE NEED MORE SARAH PALIN'S TO LEAD US....




          God bless you and your family.. .Keep up the good work... Stay the course... The future of
          our children and grandchildren are depending on it.




          Respectfully,




          Larry Israel
