          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,




          I am very much impressed by your stand on the joy your son has brought to you even though
          he is disabled. Your resolve to keep him and not to choose to abort him says alot about
          your character and determination. If I were in your state I would consider it a honor to
          call you a sister of the state but since I belong to the state of Texas I call you a
          sister of this great nation. May God Bless you and keep you and your son in his good
          graces.  Happy Mother's Day a little early!



                                                 Love & Prayers,

                                                 Barbara C. Valka
