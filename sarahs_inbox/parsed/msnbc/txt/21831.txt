              Got it. We'll do it. And I do remember him! He also wrote for AK Magazine and a few other
              publications.

              Hi Sarah,



             I received this request from my mom about Ron Wendt,. I don't know if you remember him but
             he was the janitor at Wasilla Jr and High School when we were in school there. He passsed
             away this past Saturday and was very proud and vocal of the fact that he knew you when you
             were young.  His wife contacted my Mom and asked that I contact you and see if you could
             possibly write the family a letter of condolence. It would mean a lot to them.



             Thanks and keep up the good work!



             Franci

                Hi Franci,




                I received a call from Bonnie ( Ron's wife ) informing me that he had

               passed away on Saturday morning.



               Bonnie told me that Ron had always been so proud of the fact that he

               knew Sarah and that he was so blessed by her commitment to the State of

               Alaska.    Ron was a great guy, a gentle giant of a man. He was an

               extremely talented writer with hundreds of published articles and books

               to his credit.



               Bonnie asked me if it would be possible to have you contact Sarah asking

               her write to a letter to the Wendt family. Bonnie said it would mean so

               much to her, his parents and siblings.



               Thanks Hon.

                                  Love,   Mom

               ps: I didn't think to get Bonnie's home email. If you need it let me

               know.
