            Goveror Palin

                It has been a great disappointment to learn that "Wildlife Mitigation" fencing is not
            in the ADOT budget. Last year 6 people were killed in the State of Alaska in moose auto
            accidents. How many more people will be killed becase of the short changing Alaskans on
            safety on the Alaska highways? Only god knows.

                 In my community council area we have had over 350 moose auto accidents in 14 years and
            on person killed last December and that person had returned from Iraq two weeks before
            that.

                You had a big deal about what to do with surplus monies from oil. I think that you
            need to think of highway safety in the 2008 / 2009 budget.

                Wildlife fencing is needed in Fairbanks , Wasilla , Palmer Hay flats, Anchorage, and on
            the Kenai . I know that wildlife fencing will not stop all accidents but it will inmprove
            the highway safety.

                This is not a fish and game issue, it is only A ADOT issue. Please leade from the
            front on this issue and get good people to look closer at this issue.



            Sincerely
