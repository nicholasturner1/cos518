              Dear Sarah.

                              I thought you would want to know, since you've had a good working

              relationship for many years (and he adores you) with bunt, that his

              wife passed away yesterday Oct 24.

                             He is taking her death very hard. Celia is being cremated.           There

              will be a Memorial Service at St Davids, but date is not yet

              established.

                             Take care, keep up the good work - we all root for you!          Merlyn

              Matheson
