            Dear Guv,

            Henry Novak called Samon yesterday afternoon and we'll try to make the Merit Inn on
            Saturday. If Samon works I'll be there. I am down to 180 pounds from 210 last year
            and I have a spring in the "old steps." I see now that I'll make it to 2010, so
            I'll retrieve the "Fedora" from you later on and advertise for you again. I was
            worried that I would not make it to 2010.

            Love from Bill,     Samon and Teedah

             Subject: RE: Whitewater Pardon/Kake
             Governor:

             I am fully responsible for the meeting taking place yesterday in your conference room. I was not aware of
             James Stanford's role in the meeting or the project. It was never brought up in any previous
             conversations I had with the project's local proponents. The list of attendess I was given appears below--
             and he is clearly not on it. At least one other gentleman who attended was not on the list, either-Terry
             Otness. I will get a full list of actual attendees and compare it to what was provided to me. The
             background on how it got to the point it was yesterday is a somewhat long story that I will try to
             summarize here.

             When you came into office , one of the first things I was tasked with was attending a meeting in Ketchikan
             on the AK- BC intertie feasibility study that got underway during the Murkowski administration . There is a
             backstory on the funding history for the study that does involve Thom Fishcer, but I will leave it for further
             explanation at this point . The study (and project) has considerable support from the Southeast
             Conference , and at the time I know I did not appreciate the differences between the AK-BC intertie project
             and the Swan-Tyee intertie project that was ultimately included in your March budget request to the
             Legislature . The results of that study have been in Ron Miller 's office since mid-May awaiting his
             approval to make it final and post on the AK Energy Authority's website.

            Shortly after session ended , John Bitney took a meeting with Don Kubley and Bob Loescher to go over
            the project. At the time, he told me that he didn ' t expect much and that it was likely to be another one of
            Kubley's pie-in -the-sky projects . However, he came away from the meeting intrigued because of the
            involvement and interest of American Insurance Group (AIG)--one of the nation 's largest insurance
            companies that has tremendous investment capacity for large projects.

            After Bitney 's departure in July, Don contacted me and asked that he be able to come give me the same
            briefing on the project. I accepted the request and met with he and Bob Loescher , the former CEO of
            Sealaska . At that time, he was really pressing hard for your support-public support--that he could take
            with him to DC. I declined to take it up with Tibbles or anyone else because it was too soon. I also
            expressed dissatisfaction with the notion that the Palin Administration would support an effort that
            involved Thom Fischer.

            Upon Kubley's return from DC, he requested another meeting to de-brief on how the meetings with Sen.
            Murkowski and Rep. Young went. I accepted and he brought with him two representatives from Kake
            Tribal-the president, Harold Martin and the president of their power group Matt Bell. They explained that
            Kake was buying out Tollhouse Energy (Fischer's group). This was due to the displeasure I had
            expressed, the displeasure Sen. Murkowski expressed, and AIG's insistence. At that meeting, I told him
            that a project to deliver cheap, clean power to California (or anywhere outside Alaska) while
            villages/communities in the same region are paying 40 to 60 cents per kilowatt hour was unlikely to get
            your support-that there had to be a way to address the local needs or it would have a hard time getting
            off the ground.

            With that, they assured me there was a plan to provide local power supplies. They also indicated that
            representatives of all the companies involved were coming up to Alaska for a round of meetings, site
            visits, and requested a meeting and briefing with you. Tibbles thought it was premature and suggested
            that we have them meet instead with folks who could groundtruth the presentation. For that reason, I
            asked that Commissioner Hartig attend since he is the lead on your climate change subcabinet (he also
            has some familiarity with large projects due to his previous background). I also asked that Ron Miller and
            Sara Goad from AIDEA/AEA attend to scrutinize the project finances. Finally, I invited Commissioner
            Nottie and his special assistant, Joe Austerman , to attend since there is supposed to be a local

             component for the communities.

             The night before the meeting , Ron Miller called to ask how seriously he should take the presentation . I explained
             what I knew about the project , the presentation , and the players-namely , that AIG's involvement in particular had
             me interested . He then indicated that the connection with AIG could be attributable to Jim Clark-that his firm
             represents them in Alaska. That was the first I had heard of any connection with Clark.

             The reason I allowed them to use your conference room is that I fully intended to attend the presentation when we
             scheduled it. As it turns out , the AGIA and PPT meetings were scheduled with you and there was a conflict on my
             schedule. I was able to move in and out of both meetings as a result.

             Again, I take full responsiblity for the meeting taking place , the commissioners being involved, and for the use of
             your conference room. I had no idea that James Stanford was attending or involved-- let alone that he has any
             relationship to your family. I apologize for whatever stress I created for you on this.

            What was the deal with that group meeting in the conference room today on a "$5 billion green highway project"? Who met,
            why did they use the Gov's office conference room, what's this project, what's the lobbyist's role (Kubley?) in this? And who
            all were the folks in the hallway that I ran into after their meeting? And what is James Stanford's role in this? If Jim Clark and
            Tom Fischer used James to get access to Commissioners (and to kick us out of my conference room today to make room for
            Kubley's meeting), then that was inappropriate and unethical

            And what's Ron Miller's role in this?
