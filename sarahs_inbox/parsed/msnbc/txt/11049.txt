            I called Portia on it--radio silence so far.



           Quinn just so happens to have a phone interview with Lyda this morning and plans on asking
           who provided the "verbal invitation" because neither the governor, her employees, or
           friends received any kind of invitation.



           Let him know Portia should be answering some of these questions too...he said he'd fill me
           in after the interview.

           Alrighty....just got off line with Lyda. She has plenty of gray area, saying she "was
           told by one of the guys who co-hosted the event that he 'told all of them to come on
           over'.". She then said, "it was not by me, I didn't invite her.". When I asked her to
           recall which co-host, she thought about it a bit and said she really couldn't remember.



          ,I said, "oh so the Gov wasn 't individually invited?". She said "I think they just said
           ' you guys come on over'".



           Very vague .... and I thought there was only one co-host? Why's she saying she can't
           remember?



           I'm not sure here, but I'll get with Sharon and imatbe we can get mainstream media to do a
           little contrast.



           At very least I know Eddie Burke will pick up on it.

            How can we check her on it now- depending on what Frank/Ivy find? Someone call reporters?
            Me put out a personal statement on it?

             Will do. Also in response to the emails about Lyda, I too think she should be called out
            on this. Her dishonesty shouldn't go unchecked... it'll be interesting what Frank
            discovers.

             May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to
            address it before I leave for Juneau. Update on clean water initiatives/Gillam's efforts
            too?

             I agree . We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I
            think it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change.

             I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in
            the room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
            streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
            understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

             Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either
            lying again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn 't passed on to me? If
            she lied again , it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more
            deception.
