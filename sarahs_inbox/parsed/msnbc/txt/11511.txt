            Thanks Sharon. Between you and me, sometimes I wonder why it doesn't bother the AGIA team
            that so many of our critics' points just go unanswered. They speak internally about how
            misinformed critics are - but don't seem to see the need for Alaskans to be asurred we're
            on the right path and we know what we're doing. Be prepared for some to try to talk me out
            of responding, or clarifying, but I shall do so because Alaskans do need to know truth -
            and both sides of the issue. Thanks

              Also, I' m speaking to Fairbanks Chamber on Tuesday. What tone do you want me to take
            with respect to Conoco issues and Port Authority?
