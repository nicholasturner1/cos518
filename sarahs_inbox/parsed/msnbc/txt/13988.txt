             Don't take offense-

             We do need to respond asap and I'm asking Frank to pass along any emails/messages
             necessary to communicate the huge concerns I have over the outcome of this and the fact
             that too many believe we've ignored the public's demand for AK's NEEDS to be met FIRST
             before huge Canadian project. I asked Frank to communicate this.

             AGIA team needs to be poised to tout what the Gov has ALREADY asked them to do.... map out
             the prospects for in-state Gas. We are ahead of the Senate bi-group on this one, but if
             Joe, Bruce, et all don't get on the front side of this it'll look like Lyda and Charlie
             have forced us into this which is absolutely not the case.

             This administration did not NEED the poll that Huggins referenced to have the wisdom to
             look at these prospects . They knew it was the right thing to do and it is being looked at
             in conjunction with the highway route.



             Governor I don ' t want to task you with anything .... there's an AGIA communications meeting
             going on right now .   Do you want me to interject these comments on their meeting in light
             of the senate press conference?

            Subject : House and Senate Resolution




            Wanted to give you guys a heads up from Don . He was in the ANGDA office and saw a
            resolution that the House and Senate are going to support .  The resolution calls for
            amending the special session agenda to include in-state gasline proposals to be
            considered . Don asked for a copy of the resolution , but they wouldn ' t give him one.



            Not sure if and when this is going to happen , but wanted to pass along .   I just looked at
            the House and Senate floor calendar and I don ' t see it on there , nevertheless it could
            come up.
