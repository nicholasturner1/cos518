       Chuck:  Yes - we need this task force . We're in a cabinet mtg right now discussing the
       topic. Have Joe Austerman get thinking on this - I just cleared his participation with
       Commissioner Notti.

       Mike Tibbles will be in charge. Let him talk to you about it and some of the other plans
       we have for revitalization/changes within Ag. (And MatMaid.). This will be awesome!
       Stand by for Tibbles and Kris Perry to contact you with directives.

       You have my blessing and THANKS for being concerned and energized and excited about
       finding solutions.

       I'm ccing Cabinet members be their areas are also affected by the MatMaid issue and just
       wanted to let them know we're off and running with the task force idea. Ccing Franci, too,
       so she'll be a part of it.
       You don't have to respond to this entire list.

       Also, intriguing idea(s) from Kaladi Bros guys re: local product they tried to get MatMaid
       to hear them on months ago.

       Sarah,

       Joey and I stayed and talked with Bob Havemeister
       after the rally about potential solutions. We'd like
       to form a steering committee which would include dairy
       farmers , businessmen , and key state people, to come up
       with a viable strategy .   Bob is all for downsizing and
       getting back to basics .   Do we have your blessing to
       proceed or do you have something else in mind?

       Chuck

       ps.  Lots of happy people because you showed up.
