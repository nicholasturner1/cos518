            Subject :    Intent Language on Head Start Funding




            Governor Palin:




            Thank you for your letter dated 2/21/08 .          Your comments are appreciated.



            Today I am writing to ask for your support in removing the intent language from the
            $600,000 increase in Head Start grants .  Please do not make use of these vital funds
            contingent on finding matching funds - dollar for dollar .   It is not known if matching
            funds could be found and by putting this stipulation in - you possibly limit getting those
            qualified children off the wait list and into this proven - effective program .   Please,
            take the intent language out of the Head Start budget increase.



            Thank you,

            Patty Wisel , Head Start parent
