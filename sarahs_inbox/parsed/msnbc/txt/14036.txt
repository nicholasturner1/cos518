             Governor -



             On the crime legislation we introduced ,       we have started working with

             Sen. McGuire to try and roll provisions into a bill she has in House

             Finance.




             DOT is also working with Rep. Meyers office to explain the need for lots

             of capital items.



             We'll stay at it.



             Randy

            Mike will be contacting you re:           the assistance needed as Stedman has put

            a stop to all Governor's bills , and you saw what Senate leadership did

            to the budget yesterday - actions that negatively affect your budgets,

            our agenda to move this state forward , etc. We do need your assistance

            here to have restored those things that will allow you all to do your

            jobs for Alaskans. Thank you.
