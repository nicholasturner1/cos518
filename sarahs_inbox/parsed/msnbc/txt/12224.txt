             And great to hear how well your daughter is doing ! It's amazing to think Isabella is
             already 7 months . That first year just zips by.



             I think it would be spectacular if the gasline guys could work something out with you to
             tap into your awesome talent and work ethic. Working from home, your own hours, nothing
             more than part-time... it really could be accomodating to your schedule.



             Kurt Gibson is proving to be a great spokesman for AGIA, Bruce is good too. Marty comes
             across well. They're pulling things together so well to get that needed national message
             out there... I get nervous about our local critics growing legs under their constant
             gripes about us, so I'd like to see a greater focus locally still - but AGIA guys also are
             aware of the need to get more national recognition and support for the gasline. Again,
             Kurt is a great spokesman for this. I know they all want to work with you - as do I (and
             the rest of the crew   Kris, Frank, et al).



             If it works for you, we can make it work all the way around.



             Thanks for your message Meg. It's great to hear you're doing great.
