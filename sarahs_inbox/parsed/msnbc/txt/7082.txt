         Governor,

         Fairbanks sounds good to me - warm weather! Have you determined if you

         wish to make the AGIA bill signing an "event" by inviting potential

         applicants, or keep it lower key? If you decide to invite industry, we

         should begin to get it on their schedules.

         Marty
