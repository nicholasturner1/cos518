          Subject:                   RE: Today


          Governor - The event today is sponsored by the Abused Women's Aid in Crisis (AWAIC) -
          Domestic Violence Awareness Month.  You can sit onstage with the Lt. Governor and read the
          proclamation and then the Lt. Governor will say a few words. The proclamation is at the
          event and signed. I have pasted it into the body of this email.



          The event on Thursday, October 4 is sponsored by the General Federation of Women's Club.
          This is also a Domestic Violence and Abuse to Women event. 11:00 a.m. at the Hilton Hotel
          Chart Room.  The Lt. Governor was attending as you would possibly be in Juneau on that
          date.



          On either event the Lt. Governor is more then happy to accompany you or step down. Janice



          WHEREAS, domestic violence is a vicious cycle that disrupts communities, destroys
          relationships, and harms thousands of Alaskans each year. It comes in the form of
          physical, emotional, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse.



          WHEREAS, domestic violence is not confined to any group or groups of people; it affects
          people of all ethnic backgrounds, economic levels, education levels, family structures,
          religions, and ages. it is a pervasive problem in every community in Alaska, large and
          small.



          WHEREAS, the crime of domestic violence violates an individual's dignity and right to be
          safe from violence in their home. it violates the peace and health of communities as well
          as the laws of the State of Alaska. Domestic violence is not a private family matter -.it
          is a crime.



          WHEREAS, the existence of domestic violence in our homes transforms the home from a place
          that is meant to be loving and safe into a place of danger, despair, and fear. It
          diminishes the quality of life for every resident of Alaska.



          WHEREAS, the effects of domestic violence on children are devastating and can cause
          lifelong problems due to emotional and/or physical trauma. These children are at a
          greater risk of being part of an abusive relationship as adults, thus continuing this
          cycle of abuse.



          WHEREAS, beyond the suffering of victims, families, and communities, domestic violence
          also has financial costs.  These include lost income and long-term productivity, medical
          care, law enforcement, legal and court expenses, social and emergency services, crime
          compensation, and problems in the school and workplace.

                                                                  1




                                                                                                              PRA GSPO1_ 0006046

         WHEREAS, as Alaskans, we must demonstrate with our words and our actions that domestic
         abuse will not be tolerated. As Alaskans, we must continue to build alliances among
         governments , community associations , businesses , education , and faith - based organizations
         that will strengthen our families , teach alternatives to violence , and hold the offenders
         accountable for their crimes.




         NOW, THEREFORE, I, Sarah Palin, Governor of the State of Alaska, do hereby proclaim
         October 2007 as:



         Domestic Violence Awareness Month




         in Alaska, and call on all Alaskans to become active in the fight to end domestic violence
         in all of its forms, and to assume the responsibility to make the message clear , both by
         word and deed , that domestic violence is unacceptable . Let us continue to mourn those
         victims who have died, celebrate those who have survived, and support and respect those
         who work to end violence.
