  Randy sold 1 more ticket, so that's 2 tickets for him.

  I spoke to Cathie Roemich and sent her the fundraiser flyers- she will email them to people that she thinks
  might be interested. Cathie R. and Chuck Collins announced the fundraiser at the Chamber luncheon this
  afternoon. I'll call Chuck soon to see if he was able to sale any. We're gaining some momentum. :) I
  made a few other phone calls but am waiting to hear back.

  I think there's a cruise that quite a few Republicans are on- like Romer & Paulette Simpson and a few
  others from my church ; and those are vital connections for an event like this.

  I think we'll still do really well raising money and it's a good trial run for our future events!! Very
  disappointing that our Foundation members haven't sold any...adding the 13 new members will be help
  immensely.


  Thanks,
  Erika
