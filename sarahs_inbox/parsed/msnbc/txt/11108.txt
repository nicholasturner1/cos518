              Thanks:  Sounds like PA asked for parts of it kept confidential- parts of the supplements
              from them two companies that didn't come through for them and made them miss the deadline
              (evidently).



              Thanks Sharon

              Did PA or the two companies request conf attachments?

               Governor,




                The PA's 10 page letter is a.public record and was made available yesterday afternoon.
              It was supposed to go up on the AGIA website at some point.



                As you may have noticed, the letter does not identify the specific companies; the
              attachments do.  The attachments have been requested to be treated as confidential.



                Joe

               Is the PA's application made public, along with its supplement? I assumed it was- hope
             it is- the adn made it sound like it wasn't, per Whitaker's comment. .



               The public may comment on all five proposals, nothing stops that, but of course the
             application we're considering is TC's. (For that matter they may comment on CP's, also.).



               Thanks

                                                                 2
