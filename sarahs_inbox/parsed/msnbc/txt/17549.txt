             Alan stopped in today to sign the resignation letters . We can now move forward with sending nominations back
             east.

             North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission : Submit one nomination. We were considering Privileged           Because
             this appointment comes directly from the president it could take some time to get the new person appointed. Alan
             said it took two years before he was officially appointed . An acting board member selected from the Commission
             served until he was appointed.

             Berin Sea Fisheries U.S. Advisory Board: Submit two nominations. We were considering Privileged or Person
             and Prlvile ed or One has to be a preferred choice. Travel and lodging expenses for this board can't be paid
             through the Office of the Governor. Earl Kreiger in ADF&G manages a federal grant that is used for travel to board
             meetings.

             Thanks,
