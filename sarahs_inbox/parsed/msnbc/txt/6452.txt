          In doing my own poll of legislators this weekend: so far everyone I've spoken with says
          they sure hope my reco is a simple gross tax w/simple incentives for more exploration and
          development - the more they produce the more credit they can claim to reduce their tax
          bill.



          The most important thing, they say, is for us to not vacillate - instead I think they want
          us to be insistent because they're willing to follow. Makes sense.



          They also want the session in Anchorage, but don't want to have to say that publicly.
