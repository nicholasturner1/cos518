            Governor,      we wouldn't have this from David without your letter to Backbone. Enjoy.



            Also on the day I talked to Jim Whitaker, I didn't have the time to listen to phone
            messages but I have a recorded message from Jim that I want to share with you. Very
            complementary.



            Finally the first mining check has arrived for the dairy               farmers .   We are staying
            completely out of the publicity.



            Have a great weekend, I get to go home.                Tom

             Attached is the testimony of David Gottstein for later this afternoon. I think anybody on
             the team who has put in the time and energy to get us to this point should take pride in
             our results.  These guys get it. Tune in on Gavel-to-Gavel or the internet to watch at
             3:30.



             Joe
