   Governor,

  Would you like to invite your cabinet or senior staff to the tea/reception? If so, you could extend a
  personal invitation while they're all together, and we could follow up with an email invitation so they have
  the details. We could handle about 20-25 extra guests.

  Thanks,
  Erika
