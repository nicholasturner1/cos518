         Hello Governor,



         You do not need my permission to use the state credit card. We just need to know what
         you've used the card for to post a charge correctly, and we'll get that information from
         your secretary or whomever when we need it. Please feel free to check with me anytime you
         want to, but you certainly aren't required to. You may also just may note what a charge
         is for on the back of the receipt and have staff send it to us. If you use the card for a
         personal rather than state or official charge, we will simply request reimbursement when
         appropriate.



         Thank you Governor,

         Linda
