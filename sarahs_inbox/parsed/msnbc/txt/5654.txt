           Ivy -

           FYI, my meeting this morning was trumped by AGIA (which will be the subject of today' s press conference) - so
           I'm still on-call for a meeting with the Governor and Chief of Staff regarding my conversation with Ed before we
           have a final roll-out of the Council.

           At least we have a sunny day in the meantime . More as things develop...
