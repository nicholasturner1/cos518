          Subject :                 Sp session


          Kris and Mike: What is the latest on Fairbanks asking for                sp session - and did Malcomb
          ever answer back on cpt cook for a sp session venue?



         Mike   is Nizich still the lead on sp session logistics? I've not heard anything from him
         on ep session info that's needed to make good decisions on location selection and time is
         zipping by, as I expressed back in may when we first started discussing ideas on sp
          session.



         Polling leggies got us nowhere except criticism for me not "taking a stand" and concluding
         where it should be held. Lyda refuses to give input, yet wins the argument then that I'm
         the only governor who "hasn't worked with..." the leggies on a special session. (Her
         claim.) Meanwhile, we're waiting to hear any info on logistics that I need in order to
         make a good decision asap.



         The sooner I get the info, the better. If Nizich isnt the go-to guy on this, pls find a
         SouthCentral contact person so info can be gathered asap so good decisions can be made
         asap on locale. Thanks!
