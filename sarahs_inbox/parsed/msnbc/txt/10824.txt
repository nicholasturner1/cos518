             Donuts tomorrow morning in the AGIA war room. 14th floor @ DNR.



             You're invited. I'll bring the donuts, I'll meet you on our floor at 9am, then we'll walk
             down with the grub to thank the team at 9:15.



             Tara- can we get a couple pots of coffee to bring down too? Thanks!
