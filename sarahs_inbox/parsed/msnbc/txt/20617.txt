               Dear Madam Governor,
               I would like to say I am a 30 year Alaskan resident. And it does my heart as. well as many other
               Alaskans good to know that we finally have a Governor that TRULY loves Alaska. Madam Governor
               you will go down in history as one of if not the greatest Governor. Alaska has ever had. I can sit here
               and truly compare you to the late Governor Jay Hammond. The two of you truly love Alaska.
               Thank you for your time and you will always have my vote.
               Johnny Gray
