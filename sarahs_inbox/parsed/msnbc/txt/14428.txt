           MESSAGE:

           Dear Honorable Governor Palin,

             I just read the article about your new son Trig. My wife and I would encourage you and
           your husband and family into what a Blessing a special needs child can be. Ruth delivered
           our 3rd child 41 years ago,she was 26 at that time. We were advised to institutionalize
           Matthew but we refused. Matt is great with numbers, remembers people and their names and
           what they were doing the last time they were together, he loves our Lord and Saviour.

           I am an Ob-Gyn who recently found out about Ambrotose, Matthew has been taking it for
           about one year and has been able to go off of

           wellbutrin which he was taking for anxiety, he has been fine.

                We wish you well as you raise Trig and govern that beautiful

           State of Alaska and know that God will honor you choice to honor him.                         Sincerely,
           Clif and Ruth McClain  4-26-08
