           I don't get why there is an investigation of Gov. Palin's



           firing of Monegan. In every State in the union, people



           serve at the pleasure of the Governor and are dismissed for



           who ever knows the reasons.



           Only in Alaska, will taxpayers have to pay hundreds of thousands of $$ for an
           investigation.

           I am also tired of Andrew ( know it all)     Halcrow complaining about Governor Palin. He is
           nothing but a poor loser.



           I think Gov . Palin is doing a good job.



           In fact , Governor Palin,      you are in my prayers.
