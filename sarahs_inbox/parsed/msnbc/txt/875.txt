Todd,

I won't be in today Kaitlin is home sick and I'm not feeling well either. I should be in tomorrow and will
do what I can today on my computer.

Sorry, the timing isn't good with you being in Juneau.

That's a bummer that you broke your arm. Very impressive that you finished the race!!

Thanks,

Erika
