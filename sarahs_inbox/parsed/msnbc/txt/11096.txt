             Erika- we just landed . I need to get on my pc to work on and print state of state speech,
             but looks like my computer was moved or something changed... it won ' t turn on. I'll either
             need it asap , or will need to get on your computer downstairs.   ???

             Thanks

             Governor,



             It took over five hours , but we managed to drop nearly 600 words, from 3 , 065 to the
             attached draft at 2,470! We also tried to clarify and improve flow.      To tighten, we had
             to edit your words , hopefully we didn ' t lose many of your favorite turns of phrase. We
             embedded some comments to explain some thought processes , but toward the end just forged
             forward in the interest of time.



             We also confirmed all but one figure , noted in a comment .              Sean will see to that one.




             Anyway , indulge us by opening the "clean " version first ? The markup is also attached, for
             rejecting changes you dislike .  Let us know if there is anything else you need.
