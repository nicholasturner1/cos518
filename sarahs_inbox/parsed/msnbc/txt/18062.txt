           Governor,
           Sunny just mentioned your request to remove the Kensington trip from the schedule. I knew that you would be
           concerned about the number of days in Juneau so I thought of a solution. The Weekly Standard folks, after the
           lunch on the 18th, are going on a trip to Kensington and then up to the icefield. I was thinking that we could move
           our trip from the 19th to the 18th, have lunch, attend the Kensington mine tour with the Weekly Standard staff
           (which could be a very good trip for you to talk about the significance and concern with the 9th circuit decision)
           and then split apart and we would continue with our Juneau access tour . We could accomplish what was two
           days of events in one. You could head back to Anchorage that night or the next day, giving you an extra day to
           get out in the public. Please let me know if you would still like to cancel or if the suggested itinerary sounds like a
           possibility. Thank you.

           Mike
