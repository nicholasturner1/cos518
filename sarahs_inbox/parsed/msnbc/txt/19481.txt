           Just an FYI, the RGA event times on the calendar are wrong, the event locations are wrong,
           apparently they changed this morning's breakfast from open to 'executive committee only,
           which was embarassing for me finding out so late and it was not necessary for the Gov to
           attend. Christie said she emailed you the updated schedule and briefing on Thursday - did
           you get it from her? If not, let me know so that I can address it with them if we're not
           getting what we need. My fault that I didn't realize until too late that there was no
           briefing info..



           In all of our busyness, we need to figure out a better system, help, etc. Thanks.



           Will check in later
