                  Yes. This was discussed in our meetings with the above mentioned and Commissioner Lloyd.
                  He disclosed it in his cover letter.

                  "In the summer of 2006 , I owned a king crab pot that was involved in a
                  misdemeanor violation (set hours too early). Another individual was
                  authorized to set or retrieve my pot under his own permit . I was not
                  present for the violation , but was the owner of the pot and received a
                  ticket which I paid."

                  Sharon: Is this the Larry Edfelt who was cited last year for a fishing violation , ABWE Troopers ini
                  Juneau , fishing for crab during a closed season ? I haven't checked the court computer file yet
                  so don 't know how it came out . Looks like he put his pot in 2 -3 hours before season opened,
                  personal use , fined $200, crab seized . Age 63 so looks like the same guy.

                  No big deal but maybe earish.
                  Regards , Sheila
