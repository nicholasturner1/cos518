        Governor:

        Yesterday the House Speaker sent a letter to the Senate President requesting

        consideration for calling themselves into a special session before the end

        of June to consider 1) Senior Care sunset extension ,              and 2 ) passage of

        authorization for Pension Obligation Bonds.



        The hope is that this will be done before June 15th.



        At the moment is not public information .            There is a chance that the Senate

        will take the approach of letting the issue remain unsettled for a while.

        If that is the case, I expect the House will write a letter to the Governor

        asking us to call a special session.



        Please everyone ... keep this under our hats until we see how the legislature

        sorts this out amongst themselves.



        John
