           If you see Janelle Everett ,  give her a big hug for me. Janelle is news director at KBRW.
           Once while she was on an extended vacation in her home state of Alabama , she stored her
           parka in my house .  My God . The darned thing weighed almost as much as me. And that's a
           lot.



           You can't miss Janelle.  She's big, black and beautiful.   She's one of Alaska's veteran
           radio reporters -- having worked in Bethel and Kodiak as well as Barrow.



           Also a quick correx. Barrow's Dalton Hwy Corridor hearing is July 23rd, not June 23rd.
