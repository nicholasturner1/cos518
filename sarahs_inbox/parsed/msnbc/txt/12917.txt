            I noticed that there's a short but very good = editorial in today's ADN about our earmark
            policy.



            I believe that Matt decided not to publish = my Op-Ed piece on the grounds that the
            subject matter has = received enough coverage by them. But, I'd like to think that = he
            felt a little bit guilty and then decided to write his own editorial, = which is probably
            a better result anyway.



            Perhaps, another newspaper which has not = devoted as much coverage to earmarks would be
            willing to publish = the Op-Ed. I think it's a reasonable summary of the = current
            situation in DC and does contain some new information on transporta= tion earmarks, which
            precipitated the problem to begin with. =

             cause in = Congress. It's harder for him to get federal funding for Alaska projects, = he
             says, when critics can say your own state doesn't like earmarks.

            May= be so. But the Palin administration hasn't said all earmarks are evil. It = has
            merely scaled back the state's list of funding requests, using some = sensible criteria,
            like whether the project involves any federal responsibi= lity and has strong public
            support.

            The governor recognizes = that legitimate federal funding requests may come from other
            sources, like = local governments and the university.

            In short, when it comes to = federal pork, Gov. Palin is talking about reduced portions,
            not going = without. That's the reality these days, thanks to past earmarking = excesses.
            Cutting the list of earmark requests and using tighter criteria = to screen them should
            make it easier to defend the Alaska projects that do.= get federal funding.
