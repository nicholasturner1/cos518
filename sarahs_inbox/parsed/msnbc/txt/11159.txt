             MESSAGE:

             Sarah,

               Please have ADF&G, Div. of Wildlife Conservaton Director Doug Larsen put a way to
             contact him on the website... Atleast a comment deposit on the web?

               Also please have the Div . put where their funds come from on the web.

               It would also be nice to quick link back to the state home page from there also.

               It is hard to defend the management or use of the resoures              without tools.
             Thanks ! ... Robert



               That's the simplist I can do.



              Hey... Great job by the way, do not let the first wave of fatalists get you down.
