                  Cc:       Mike Nizich; Sarah Palin
                  Subject: Governor Palin/NGA Committee Chair

                 I haven't seen a press release from NGA, but the attached list of Committees states that Governor Palin is Chair
                 of the Natural Resources Committee.

                 I'm thinking that, with all of the members of Congress coming to Alaska, a press release concerning the
                 Governor's appointment might be a good stroke. So, you or Sharon might want to coordinate this with NGA's
                 press office.
