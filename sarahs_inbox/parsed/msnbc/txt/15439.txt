          Thanks! The crew is doing very well now on radio shows explaining it all.



           Last night's event of yours was very fun! Congrats on the great showing, the great energy
          there - your great words that were bold and very committed to serving for the right
          reasons. Your email afterwards was appreciated too - it was my and Todd's pleasure to be
          there. You're doing awesome.

          I suspect we're going to look back and say that the roll out was a defining moment for
          this Administration. It could not have gone better and you and the team did a great job!
