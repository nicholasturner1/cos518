  Todd,

  the Foundation members that responded have said "yes" for the pricing change of 2 tickets for $500 and
  1 for $300. I haven't heard back from Randy yet, as I'm sure he's quite busy.

  Darla Buck

 No one has yet to sale any tickets. Ginger Johnson and Paulette Simpson are out of town; I haven't been
 able to reach Chuck Collins yet but will keep trying.
