Subject:                  Thank you


...For expressing your concerns about me working many hours, and accomodating my newborn's
needs while I work for all Alaskans. I'll keep your concerns in mind.



It's a joy to be in this position, bringing a new little loved one into this world. I'm sure if you have
children you know the feeling!



Thanks for sharing your concern, which seemed to center on safety? I'll be safe and will make sure
my employees are safe during those times I have the baby with me to nurse him and/or accomodate
the late nights that a 24/7 schedule (that any governor must keep to accomplish good things for the
state) requires.



- Governor Sarah Palin
