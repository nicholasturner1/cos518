            I am a 21 year old Republican engineering student in Louisville, Ky. I am writing to
            encourage you, Governor Palin, in the great work you have been doing for Alaska and the
            country. Please note that news of your success is exciting us all over country and I would
            like to urge you to consider running for Vice President in November. Even if you do not
            this election, I am excited about your influence on Republican politics in the years to
            come.
