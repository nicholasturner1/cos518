         > Subject: AGIA in Press Availability



         > Heads-up:




        > In the Senator Republican Minority Press Availability , Senator Wilken just said that he
        worries AGIA could die from a thousand paper cuts . They need someone other than admin and
        producers speaking to them and providing objective thoughts on the issue. More
        specifically , consultants designed to assist - like a Pedro van Meurs or Econ 1. There is
        a growing sense of frustration that discussion isn't leading to resolution . We have need
        for independent advice and it's not available to us right now.




        > Senator Wagoner

        >

        > I'm suspicious of any bill - why we didn ' t have consultants available when bill started
        through committee process . But last year , when we started the process , we already had
        consultants , with PPT legislation, for instance . And I think it cripples the legislative
        process that can't be answered in the committee - cripples process . Dire lack of
        consultant available in first committee it was in , resources . Not much we can do . we're in
        the minority so we can't control , but there ' s nobody in this legislature that knows enough
        to make me comfortable.
