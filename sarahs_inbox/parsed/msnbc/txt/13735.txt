           Governor:



           Thanks . The letter is being run through formatting and proofing now. Once that is done,
           is it OK to have your signature placed on it electronically and then delivered to Sen.
           Kookesh?

           Thanks so much. It looks good to go. Hope he receives it the way we want him to-
           objectively still looking at costs and permitability is where we are.
