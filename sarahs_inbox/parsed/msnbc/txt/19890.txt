               Governor.

               While recent focus at DPS has been on personnel issues, there remain several items I would like to
               remind the Acting Commissioner we need to continue working on.

               FINISH CRIME LAB LEASE

               Finally finishing up lease negotiations for the land that will be the site of the new crime lab. This has been
               stuck for months with DPS and the muni.



               Opening up a drafting file at LAW for their attorneys to start drafting a bill cracking down on alcohol.
               Initially, this bill would contain 2 ideas we did not get through last year and 3 new ones . The proposals
               we did not get last year were:

               (a) civil fines for alcohol license holders when their clerks sell to minors and
               (b) no shipping alcohol to the bush in plastic bottles (bootleggers like to burp the air out of the plastic
               bottles so the bottled do not slosh and plastic bottles do not clank like glass against anything) (This was a
               recommendation of a joint federal-state task force on rural justice and was supported by prior troopers but
               Walt had Major Glick testify against our proposal in committee for reasons that are still unclear to me).



               Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              These are all open to discussion. There are other projects as well . I just thought it would be good for me
              to remind the Acting Commissioner of our short and long term goals for public safety.

              Thanks,

              Randy

                Rosanne: can you do this - Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:
                No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with the video Andy and Jason
                took great effort to make, where rm saying "rah rah" in support of the participants... and my husband took TWO
                DAYS of his slammed schedule to judge the pageant even!!! He left commercial fishing early to keep his
                committment to judge the thing! ! ! (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so
                no, I didn't make it in person, I was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to fairbanks to meet with seven
                members of the US Congress on ANWR, but... Sheeeesh- can folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of
                support" on something. Argggggh!
                 You know, I think IT do my own letter of correction on this one.

                Thanks Randy: I'm conacting AGIA team to get lay of the land re: timing on everything. If you
                have any insights let me know. Thanks
                Also, good, bad, or ugly (tho it'll all be good!) I'd think Energy guys and AGIA team will want to
                get together before or after legislative action on Energy Bill and AGIA... we can do a lunch,
                dinner, whatever and whenever. If rallying the troops is necessary before further leggies action is
                anticipated, then let's setr something up in a friendly venue and recharge before final steps.

                I will work on setting this up as soon as I finish testifying this morning in House Finance. It should be
                done by 1:00 pm.

                Randy- when you get a sec could you contact acting commish Glass and ask him a few questions on the next trooper
                academy- when, how many guys are going through, what can I do to help get word out around AK that we want
                more cream-of-the-crop applicants, etc. PIs let him know I'd love a status report on that (plus status on other areas
                too).
                  Once I bear from him through you I'll start emailing him.
                  Better yet, I'd like him to travel to Juneau early this week to meet with us in person and give us the current lay of
                the land... please invite him to do so. If he's unavailable early in the week then Audie should come.
