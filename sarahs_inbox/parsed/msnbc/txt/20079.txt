              Sounds great. Track is still in the mojave desert (he'll miss the President's visit by one day!) but
              Todd and I will be there. We need to get up to Fairbanks in time for that 3pm visit then. Thanks

             I have just heard from the White House. The President will stop =to refuel at Eielson AFB on
             August 4th between 3:30 and 4:30, local = time.

             The Governor is invited to greet the President at Eielson. Todd = and Track are invited as well.
             The White House recognizes that Track = may have military obligations that will preclude his
             involvement. = However, in the inimitable way of the White House, they now want to know =
             as soon as possible whether Todd and/or Track will attend.

             The White House will identify a point of contact to facilitate the = arrangements, but this has not
             yet occurred. They promised to get = back to us as soon as possible with this information.

             In addition to meeting with the Governor, the President will interact = with military personnel. I
             don't yet know in what context this will = occur.

             The White House has Janice's name, and I told them to feel free to = contact her directly as
             circumstances warrant. Janice, could you = provide your cell phone number for weekend contact
             by the White House?

             p.s. Our principal contact at the White House is Elizabeth Dial. = Her office number is 202-456-
             2896, and her cell is Privileged or F

             Some of these questions have to go through Tails and Barnhill.

             Sharon- don't answer until I hear back from Nizich, Barnhill, et al. Hopefully they gave you
             some talking points already today. Thanks
             And I don't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it, so please pass this
             email on to him before Sharon returns ADN's call Thanks
