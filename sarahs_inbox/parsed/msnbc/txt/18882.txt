             Not sure what Sen. French comments are based upon. We've been pretty clear that we were persuaded to move off a pure
             gross after reviewing new information we hadn't known about--modeling based on real costs and the effects on projects-in
             light of the guiding policies of fair value for Alaskans and good investment climate.

             Pis let me know if you hear more.
