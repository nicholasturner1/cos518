         MESSAGE:

          Sarah,

         I just want to send you a humble hello and congrats to Todd for finishing the Iron Dog.
         Dang, he is one tough First Dude!! I just want to tell you, as a almost 30 yr. Alaskan, I
         think you are doing a fantastic job as MY GOVERNOR!! You represent me and I thank you
         more than you can imagine! Stand your grounds with the big 3. I am a firm believer that
         we could not run them off the north slope if we held a gun to their head or tried to pry
         them away with a crowbar. I stand with you and support you 100%. Best Wishes and Thank
                                                             1
