          As usual I"m hearing on the news of our troops being deployed (with ceremonies) to Afg...
          and Sean just asked if I'm going to funeral today for five of our soldiers - I had to tell
          him I haven't been told of deployment nor funeral! Why doesn't McHugh let me know what's
          going on with "my" troops so I can help honor them??? I've asked repeatedly to be in the
          loop and it's unacceptable to still not be given info on military activities that I am
          expected, and should, be participating in.



          I usually see it on the news after-the-fact, and that's unacceptable.
