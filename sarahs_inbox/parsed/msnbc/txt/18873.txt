          Why aren ' t we highlighting this as the split - causer in Lyda ' s coalition ? They dont agree
          on oil taxes , we're in the middle and we're " to blame "... The two of them should be
          shooting at each other instead of us remaining in the middle getting shot . I'm trying to
          get us out of the way and deal with ACES on it ' s merits.



          But I cant do this without messaging opportunities being ignored . i wish i had more hours
          in the day...

         Still trying to sit down with it- I have to today in between mtgs.



          Pls be thinking how to message back to Hollis who is insisting he knows there                      is internal
         dissent on ACES . Part of the response is: he needs to provide specifics as his                     allegations
         are political and unfair unless he names names so I can deal with this issue -                       if there is
         an issue. If there isnt he needs to quit stirring up doubts and just deal with                      ACES on its
         merits . There is no gag order and I hope staff will publicly debate this.

                                                                  1

          I hate the politics in this, as ACES is too imp to be messing around with and I don't
         want anyone holding back if they have disagreements with the proposal.



          But please dont let anyone talk you into just letting this slide , and go unanswered. We
         do too much of that and then we have to "react " aggressively and try to unring a bell that
         critics have rung . Let's get on top of this one and I've asked Russ to call Hollis this
         morning, but Hollis has been so public about this the past few days we owe it to the
         public to answer Hollis ' accusations.
