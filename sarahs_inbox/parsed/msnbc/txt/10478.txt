             Kris said she didn't get dupe emails so it must be on my end.

             That's a good question.



             But if we change your email in the future I want to go to a totally different kind of
             solution (I know switching at some point is a bummer of a thought, but we can get more
             secure and avoid the State system directly to your blackberry).

              Do you know him? He says anonymously but I looked up the name Ron King in the employee
              directory and it lists one as being employed as a transportation planner in DOT. If you
              don't know him, I wonder how he got your yahoo address.

              I apologize for writing this anonymously, but there 's never been a forum offered for such
              blunt comments on the state email mess . I also-fear retribution for speaking my mind. I
              also apologize for my sarcasim, but at this point, it's the only way I can deal with it.




              I don't know who's idea it was to throw a party for ETS and give awards for the mis-
              implementation of the new email system, but it was a HUGE slap in the face to employees in
              other departments who devoted time and effort to try to make it work. Not to mention, it
              doesn't work properly! But the worst part is that NOTHING is being done about the
              inadequacies of the new system.



              Thanks for using technology to make it harder to do business. I thought it was supposed to
              be the other way around.



              But, whatever is easier for ETS, right?
