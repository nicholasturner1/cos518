          On monday you need to have a cell phone with at all times. The gov and others made several
          attempts to contact you. I know how much you don't like to carry one but you will need to
          get a phone and inform me what the number is.        Mike

                 Governor - I will certainly do what I can to relay the correct information. I talked with Matt Zencey the other day
                 and gave him facts. I have not seen them yet. Sharon has that info also and I am certain she has shared it with these
                 reporters.

                 I am not certain who to call or when would be the best time. Sharon can you let me know how to proceed?

                 It is so unfortunate that this has become such a distraction . Your statement was excellent. We have the states
                 business to do. The next two weeks are going to be critical to our future. People should be interested and focused on
                 that!

                 I will help any way I can.

                 It's imperative that we speak to Alaskans' questions today re: DPS . Please trust me that the best path forward, in fairness to
                 the public and consistent with an open government without anything to hide, is for me to be freed up to speak - especially
                 now that Walt has chosen to speak erroneously about his dismissal.
                   Sharon, instead of staffing the picnic today , please cont to work with Randy, Annette, Karen, Mike, and others, on
                 contacting press/public with messaging that proves I have nothing to hide; proves the legitimate reasons for the need to go in
                 a better direction w DPS ; proves this had nothing to do with Wooten, etc.
                   I desire to speak to the public on this . I've never gone the "no comment " route before and I won't do it now. Again,
                 circumstances have changed in the way this issue is to be handled because our assumption that Walt would not like public
                 discussion of his leadership was wrong, he's obviously chosen to publicly air (through the union, evidently) his false
                 allegations.
                   Also, law makers are insistent in hearing more. No fear of their proposed investigation, but I'd rather save them time and
                 resources and go directly to them and the public on a much more transparent path re: this issue.
                   Sharon- pls let reporters know (assuming they show up at the Anchorage picnic as they did at the Wasilla picnic) that I
                 desire to speak for myself on this issue and , again, have nothing to hide.
                    Randy and Karen are working on summary re: budget increases we proposed (versus dps claim last night that WE cut it so
                 drastically that troopers won't be paid their overtime); vacant positions w no action to recruit; battle over the word "integrity"
                 we desired in his contract negotiations that he did not want included (Annette- pis provide more details on that for Randy);
                 false allegations that I or anyone else pressured him to fire Wooten (even falsely accusing folks of even discussing the issue
                 with him); etc, including many other issues.
                  Please let me know where folks are able to contribute in this effort . Randy and Mace will be centerpoint on this today as I'm
                 meetin' and greetin' Alaskans at the picnic . They'll be working with Sharon to allow me more pro-active contact with the
                 media today, on this.
                  Also- Kelly, we're more than happy to speak with Hollis on this, he seems to be the spokesperson for leggies on this.

                 Reading the comment in ADN today is disturbing re: "refusal " to speak about Walt, even if leggies ask.
                   1) 1 am not hesitant to speak , but have tried to respect Walt's assumed desire for zero public scrutiny (but look where that's
                 getting us), thus we've left it with a general message of the change at DPS. That must be better explained. I'd stand up in a
                 second and explain his dismissal if my explanations thus far are not sufficient (ie, recruitment, bootlegging that Walt could
                 have focused on with his new job offer he turned down , more energy and action needed in DPS half-way through the term be
                 there's not a lot of time left to make a difference, etc). My belief has been that Walt would NOT have wanted me to talk
                 publicly about his dismissal.
                  2) We can never say we'd not talk about this, "no matter who asks ". If leggies ask via an investigation, of course we speak.

              In fact, if leggier ask via any venue, of course we speak and give them the reasons. Walt obviously doesn't mind the public
              discussion at this point, and his untruths must be countered at the same time. This is imperative or Kopp will NOT have the
              support of the dept and will NOT be given the opportunity to succeed as commissioner.
                So this perception needs to be cleared up asap - I do not fear any investigation - but it would be used as a distraction,
              obviously, and is not needed if we 're just given the opportunity to lay to rest any speculation spurred by leggies , Walt, the
              union, critics, or whomever is stirring this.
                I do appreciate the adn reported the fact that we INCREASED dps budget- leggies cut it (glad they got that right finally!),
              as opposed to the union leadership on ktva last night insisting that we cut their budget $2.5 million, and the reporter not
              challeneging that at all!
                 I am happy to more publicly address all of this be it would run counter to "open govt" now that Walt has spoken
              untruthfully about the Wooten issue (esp claims that Todd met w him more than once, Annette's and Frank 's alleged
              meetings, my alleged February discussion with Walt , all of our "pressure", etc.)
