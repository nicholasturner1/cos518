         Message:I am very disappointed that you would cut the Valley Recycling monies from two
         million to one million dollars. This investment of monies for the Valley Recycling is not
         only an effort for the environment in our area but ultimately the planet also. I would
         strongly urge you to reconsider this. I take my first graders to both the recycling
         center and to the landfill cells off 49th Street and even they understand that we must do
         more recycling.in our area. If not us, who?



          Thank you for your reconsideration of this. Faith
