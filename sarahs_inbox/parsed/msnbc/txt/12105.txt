             Subject:                 Exxon, AGIA


             Fyi- reporters asking today about pt thompson leases, my response: we're on the right
             track, as we confirmed the previous admin's decision to "prompt" development by
             challenging exxon's inactivity... We're pleased with ourt wins so far in the judiciary
             w/pt t., we're not going to try to strike a deal with exxon to change course with our
             lease challenge in the court - because we're right and there's no need to drop our
             challenge.



             On AGIA and ANDGA, I responded that AGIA can get us a major gasline in a decade, in the
             meantime we have a good relationship with andga as they share their ideas on how to allow
             in-state use of gas within this decade. I said we're open to ideas on that second mission
             - filling hungry local markets with our gas even before the AGIA gasline is built. We
             won't stand in the way of this, as we didn't stand in the way of exxon working out a deal
             with FNG to get in state use of gas on line.
