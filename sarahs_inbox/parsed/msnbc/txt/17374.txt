           -I just found an awesome LPN to fill the vacancy on the board . Her name is Aggie Jack . She's from Kotz and is
           the director of Maniilaq Association and the EMS director for NW Arctic Borough . EMS administrator of the year
           in 88 and 01 by the state of AK . Endorsed by AK Nurses Assoc.

          -1 talked to Priviled re: KABATA

          -Talked to Privile as I mentioned earlier.

          -I'm meeting w/ Mike in the morning to go over what Comm . Jackson and I have come up w/ for Health Council.
          After he signs off we'll bring it to you . April is Public Health month so we' re thinking the announcement should
          coincide.

          -Would also like to get LBC out the door this week before you leave.

          I'll follow up with you tomorrow re: these boards so I can get them out or make the changes you think need to be
          made.
