            Thanks for the heads up Governor.

            I have spoken with Bruce a number of times, as has John Hilsinger and Kelly Hepler (directors of commercial
            fisheries and sport fish). While I don't concur with him that we are ignoring the Yentna, I understand his concerns.
             Our discussions have been vigorous but amiable.

            Of course, Bruce's position is exactly opposed to that of Doug Blossom, Dave Martin, and many commercial
            fishermen in Cook Inlet that you've been hearing from, who believe that we are not doing enough to promote full
            commercial utilization of Cook Inlet salmon.

            These are extremely tough questions, with strong polarized viewpoints out in the public. From the department we
            can address the science (although not to everyone's satisfaction), but it is the Board of Fisheries who gets to
            make the difficult public policy choices on what uses (commercial, sport, personal use, etc.) are favored by their
            specific regulatory management plans.

            The emergency meeting of the Board of Fisheries on April 16 regarding the Cook Inlet salmon management plans
            will be very contentious, with drift gill net, set gill net, Kenai sport, and Susitna sport interests all at odds with one
            another.

            DL.

            Bruce Knowles from Mat-Su Fish Advisory insists Yetna, Fish Creek escapements are being ignored by
            F&G.

            He wants this addressed. He insists F & G is "all Comm fish". They're very concerned.

            He's threatening , or promising : " Emergency petition for escapement goals will be submitted for the
            April 16 meeting (B of F), in the next couple of days."

            This is also coming from Wayne Ross, evidently. (Per Mr. Knowles.)

            Just got off the phone with him. He's ticked.

            FYI - phone call I made to him was a courtesy to Wayne Ross - and the phone call didn't go very well.
