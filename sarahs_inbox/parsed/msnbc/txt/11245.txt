              Boss,



              We are coming up on another big decision on the PA request for reconsideration. The
              commissioners are leaning in one direction, but would like to talk to you this weekend.
              They are headed to DC Tuesday and Pat is traveling Monday, so they are requesting some of
              your time on Saturday or Sunday to have a teleconference. Is that something that can work
              for you? If so, is there anybody besides myself, Tibbles, and Marty that you want
              involved? Remember that we had the Lt Gov involved last time.



              Joe
