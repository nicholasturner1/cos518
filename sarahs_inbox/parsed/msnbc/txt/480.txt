Barrow also has June whaling events and I could possibly get back up there for one of them if I have
enough lead time. Kris can check perhaps be I'd probably be leaving from Anch. Kris - could you
check on Barrow , also any solstice events elsewhere ? Maybe Melissa or Susan could help you find
these Alaskan events that I should be traveling to?



Bit- I'm happy to sign bills in any of the communities. And the AO that will form the Native Elder
Council of Dyson's.



Also Bit- pis touch base w/Harris on special session logisitics - and Sr Care issue be I heard him on
the news last nite sort of punting it back to us in terms of spec session for Sr Care (he said he was
going to talk to me about it?), and we know we'll have the ppt sp session also. Pis let him know my
intention of calling it in Anch. Kris is going to run this by Hickle and Malcolm re: Cpt Cook facilities as
the IWC was held there wonderfully. (Or a public school tha's sitting empty all summer?!)

We need to wk with DOR and DNR on timing of ppt session.

And Dept of Law.



Kari- pis add to schedule my drop-by at ML&P this morn before airport. Thanks!



Meg- if track cant get off work to travel to the Blessing of the Fleet on Saturday, do you want to send
AP guy in his King Air seat instead? Quinn's asked me to let him travel with us somewhere rural.
Can anyone think of a few talking pts for the First Dude's "Blessing of..." remarks? I can add to them
if we've got a few started. Thanks!

No one is asking about Shell, just following up on your email from last

night. Golden Days in FBX are during your NGA Michigan trip July 20-22.

Barrow whaling request from Mayor Itta was April 23-May 6, he wanted you and

Todd to go whaling between those dates.
