MESSAGE:

The above said I had to name a field so pregnancy being "labor" related I thought that would do.

Congratulations on the new arrival to be. Being in the pregnancy business I can not imagine running
a house hold the size of the state of Alaska, but have confidence that you will do quite well.

If you do need a respite from the daily grind, know that the Prematernal Home here in Bethel would
welcome you with open arms.



Sincerely,

Doreen O'Brien

Director-Prematernal Home
