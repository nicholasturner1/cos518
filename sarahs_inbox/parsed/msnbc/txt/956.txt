Dear Governor Palin,



I was delighted to read in a news story that you are expecting your fifth child. From my wife Patricia
and I, who also have 5 children, congratulations. You are exactly the kind of person we need in
public office. You're an inspiration to families, and I have no doubt you're a great support to the
families of Alaska.



Yours sincerely,



Christopher Dixon
