            Fyi for statehood folks, if someone from the committee will respond to him, I'll wait to
            hear back and not respond to him myself.

            Hello Sarah,



            Remember me. . .pesky landlord of the wonderful Ms. Ivy Frye? I wanted to touch base with
            you in regards to the Silver Anniversary Celebration of Statehood. I know the Juneau
            Empire is running a story series and looking for folks to interview but I was wondering if
            you were doing a larger scale search or had a historian doing research on the early days
            of Statehood.   The reason I ask is that my Grandfather was Hugh J. Wade, first Secretary
            of State, with Bill Egan .  He was a great man and actually was asked to run the state
            directly after they were elected because Bill Egan became very sick for the first 6-8
            months of Statehood. ( So he was actually the first Governor... pretty cool eh?)
            Anyhow... my Mother, Sue McKeown , would be a great resource if you are indeed looking for
            some history and of course she would love to participate. We have a lot of Alaskan pride
            in our family and we would love to share it. She and my Dad actually had their wedding
            reception in the Governors mansion the summer of 1959...I am not sure but I think they may
            be the only couple to have celebrated there. Please let me know of the plans to
            commemorate the big 501



            Anyways, congrats on the baby and I hope all is going well. I also hope you don't think
            this is to forward contacting via email... if so let me know and I will apologize.



            Sincerely,



            Marty McKeown

            Alaskan

            p.s.  Can you squash all of those Capital Move bills for me? Not tonite...but by Monday
