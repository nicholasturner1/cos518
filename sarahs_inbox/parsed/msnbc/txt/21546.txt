              Dear governor palin.   I understand from a phone call just now with our atty tina Otto that
              she just within the last hour meeting in your anchorage office with Chris Perry and others
              on this.  There is apparently an audit under way through mikinds cottrel at Kristin Tanner
              and the board request. Tuna did also say that sen greens office has recently called for
              information on appraisals of property and asked about a memo about sale proceeds
              specifically would they go to the ag revolving loan fund and can they have a copy of the
              memo when it is done .  They were told we don't yet know who will be entitled to the memo
              when it is done . Talis.

              Lyda just told me she's called for an extensive audit of MatMaid be she said she's
              received a lot of information concerning improprieties and "problems at MatMaid",
              including "conflicts of interest with people serving". I told her "no kidding there's been
              problems, that's why we have a dedicated team of volunteers trying to get information on
              what went wrong and then how to right MatMaid". I also asked her if she's seeking to get
              information on problems we inherited, or did she feel we caused MatMaid's problems? She
              said,  "it's both".



              What's frustrating is Kristan and Kris and others have begged for assistance to get our
              own audit of MatMaid, they've basically had to do it themselves, and now it sounds like a
              legislator who doesn't necessarily want to see us succeed is moving forward on her own
              intense audit. We've had push back on our own request, which is understandably quite
              frustrating for BAC members who've cared sincerely about MatMaid and have wanted and
              needed information on MatMaid operations since Day One. I asked Lyda why don't we work on
              this together, if truly now she wants to help on MatMaid, but her goals are evidently not
              our goals - as we're not blaming this admin nor this BAC for the.problems at MatMaid.



              So, head's up.



              And I still want Kristan's request to be granted re: an audit if that's what Kristan
              needs.
