            Governor,



            Kelly and I spoke again tonight to double check we're on the same page . We are and we
            think every body else is , too. She is going to ride with Nizich and I will ride with
            Galvin. We will both talk to them to be sure.



            The only thing that remains the slightest bit unclear is who will take the lead in the
            conversation.  Kelly and I expect Nizich can do that.  However, if you would like to go
            over anything ahead of the 10:30, we could be out there as early as 10. Just let us know
            by 8 am and we can make that happen.



            Joe
