MESSAGE:

Dear Govenor Palin,



First and foremost, congratulations on the birth of your baby boy! I wish you all the happiness in the
world.



I have read that he may have Down Syndrome . My daughter, Alivia who is 2 has Down Syndrome
(DS). While this can be quite a hard time at first , I wanted to reassure you that your family wiil be fine
and in fact your other children and you will be better for it! He will bring you so much joy and amaze
you--don't let anyone convince you of anything different . We would not change anything for the world
or even take away the DS--it makes Livi who she is and she is FANTASIC, beautiful , funny and pure
sunshine.

Best wishes !!! Welcome to OUR FAMILY! Warm regards, Diane
