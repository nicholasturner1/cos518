           Hi Rhonda:

           If you get a chance tomorrow let's look at the Alaska map by Britta's desk so we can
           strategize on where we need to have a presence and I can study up on the local issues in
           areas I should be visiting. Rosanne also, as our public outreach broadens in areas I've
           yet to visit. We may get a chance to access the King Air next month, that could make for
           some convenient travel.
