         MESSAGE:

        ,I have a friend in Missouri who has been a pilot for years and also patented the most
         serviceable radar gun . He wonders how Alaska gets away with shooting wolves from
         airplanes a rule strictly forbidden by the FAA. He's a highly intelligent man with 7
         patents to his credit but he just can't figure out how Alaska gets away with this. Maybe
         you should e-mail him directly at BobAthee@aol.com.
