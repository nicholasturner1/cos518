          Channel 11 would like a few moments of your time to talk about President

          Bush's comments this morning on opening ANWR. They can come whenever you

          would like, Sharon said -- and Sharon did not let them know you were

          even going to be in today -- in case you don't want to do it.

          Kind of a moot point since we will soon have a new president and none of

          the candidates, including McCain, support the opening of ANWR.
