           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           My name is Jason Riley Hoss. I have served our great nation in US ARMY Intelligence /
           Bosnia. I graduated from college, top in my class. I have seen and experienced much in
           this world and I see absolute determination and excellence in your ability to lead. I
           simply want to say I would support you in Washington as Sen. John McCain's Vice President.
           Our country needs a leader of your character at this moment in time. I feel Benjamin
           Franklin would be so very proud of all you have done to help preserve our nation's core
           values.




           Thank you!



          Jason
