            Subject: Fox Business Tuesday



           We've had a request from Fox Business Network for an in-studio interview tomorrow
           (Tuesday, Feb. 26), after the Hoover and CNN events.



            Fox is interested in Exxon Valdez, oil and gas , and the economy.




           This request could fit in your schedule before you need to head to the airport at 3:30
           p.m. The location is about 2 miles from the Willard , so the logistics will work.




           If you would like to do this , I'll forward all information to you, Janice and Sharon.




           Beth
