            Meg,

            Governor Palin called Ian Bryce (Producer - Transformers) this morning but didn't leave a return telephone number. Is she
            going to call again or may I pass on a telephone number so he may call her? If I pass on a # please ensure whomever answers the
            telephone knows Ian is a VVIP. Also, since we are looking to shoot on the 19th or 20th Governor Palin may want to extend an
            invitation for dinner at the Mansion as is customary with other states.

            THANK YOU.

            Carolyn

             Hi Meg,

             I have two follow-up questions that stem from the governor's response to my earlier query about the
             port authority's 2005 advertisement:

             1. The governor suggests in her previous response that other entities might have a better gas line
             proposal than what the port authority has put forward. Presumably that would have been the case in
             2005 as well. So why did the governor endorse the statement in the May 2005 newspaper ad?

             2. The governor says in her response that the port authority was the only entity "with terms available
             to the public." How was it wise to make such a strong statement of support for the port authority's
             proposal in the absence of information about other proposals?


             Thanks much.

             Regarding the full-page ad from 2005, the following statement is from the Governor:

             "Because of the secretive nature of the Murkowski / producer process, at the time of the ads,
             the Port Authority proposal was the only one with terms available to the public. Thankfully,
             conditions have changed so radically since then, I no longer agree with the statement. COULD
             the Port authority end up with the best plan? Possibly -- we need the competitive process to
             determine that. With a competitive AGIA as our vehicle, as opposed to a take-it-or-leave-it
             SGDA negotiation with only one party, it would not only be premature, but counter to Alaska's
             interests, for any conjecture on which applicant or set of applicants will assemble the best
             overall project. I will not do that."

             As a point of clarification, Governor Palin was not Mayor in 2005.

             Thanks a bunch for this opportunity and for your time in Fairbanks with our gasline team.

            Subject : FW: Interview with Governor

            Janice,

            Per our conversation , could you please make sure that the Mike knows It would be best if the
            Commissioner and the Governor also talk through some of the issues highlighted below - that will
            be part of the Thursday Interview with IntraFish Media:

            I don't have any questions prepared yet, but generally I want to know what she has planned for the seafood
            industry in the way of state support, what safeguards there will be to protect seafood sector as Alaska expands its
            oil and gas drilling , her opinion on open -ocean aquaculture and whether there is a place in Alaska for aquaculture,
            whether she supports efforts to boost Alaska 's shellfish farming segment and how she will do that, her
            background coming from a salmon fishing family , her level of support for ASMI and how much money the state
            will give the agency, does she think there is anything the state can do to help protect against fraudulent use of
            name of Alaska on seafood not caught in Alaska , stuff like that. Also , we will need some photos of her , preferably
            one of her in some sort of seafood setting , ie. handling fish or speaking with seafood industry execs ; if not,
            whatever you can give us . Photos need to be 1 megabyte in size and jpeg format if possible.


            Also, would like to schedule a meeting with Anchorage Daily News' Wesley Loy between the two
            since he 's been asking for awhile now . He'll be looking for more policy at this point , but some more
            generic questions would include:

            I'd like to sound her out on a few major issues of high interest to fishing people including the
            proposed Pebble mine , offshore oil and gas leasing In Bristol Bay , and the trend toward
            " rationalizing " fisheries . That is, dividing open fisheries into individual catch shares for fishermen.

            How will the new administration work with respect to fish? For instance , past governors including
            Wally Hickel appointed fishery advisers with ready access to the governor , Will this continue?

            I'd like to hear some elaboration on this statement from Gov . Palin's State of the State address:
            "So, sub-cabinets will be established and existing cabinet goals will be amended . Let me give an
            example: We have a Fish Cabinet and basically what it's done is simply 'distribute grants.' It'll now
            work with Labor and Workforce Development to create new ideas on everything from employment
            opportunities to new seafood marketing initiatives."

           Finally, I might ask about her general philosophy on state budgeting , and the implications for
           funding Department of Fish and Game research and management.

           Thanks,
           Meg
