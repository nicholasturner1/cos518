             Disappointed highly. With your endorsement of the Nation of Islam proponent Obama. I don't
             think I will ever travel there for fun and I now know that I will cut all business with
             any companies that do my jewelry and such.



            Veteran, Business owner and obviously more highly educated than Alaskans
