             Todd replied that he'll be there w/Willow and Piper. If others come, we'll pull up chairs
             as you mentioned and I'll call Chuck and Sally. Thanks.

              Todd- who?



               Great if my folks want to be there too. And even if others (our kids) show up, we'll
             just pull up a chair for them. I'll tell them to eat beforehand.

               I have my committee meeting tomorrow and they need to know how many guests you'll have at
              the breakfast to reserve seats . This Saturday morning . It'll likely be a sold - out event
              again this year.



               Last year it was me & Willow (Chuck & Sally were there too and I can call them and see if
              they're going again this year).



               I'm planning on being there.
