            Thanks. Can that lyda letter be wrapped up with my corrections/changes by the time I get
            there? Haven't heard back from anyone on it- don't even know if others read it. It needs
            corrections. I have three emails in to the crew on the matter.

            I will call Ralph...



            And, Janice was going to call the St. Paul folks. It was tentative anyways and certainly
            not a priority at this time.

            Governor - I will cancel all of DC. Hannah will confirm the Motorcycle Blessing Event and
            let the Slush Cup folks know that you will be attending with the First Family. Please see
            options below that were regretted due to you being in DC. If we need to change these
            please let me know.
