              And they were so glad that we cared about this historic project - they had me on the big
              printed posters/schedules so it's a good thing I showed ... and Judith Bittner was a great
              escort. She helped out a lot.



              I'll let Kris know that Judith enjoys working with her and Statehood events and wants to
              be more help to Kris.



             I'll also let Joe B know they appreciate DNR's coordination with BLM on the historic trail
             project - and that they got cut out of our budget last year but are seeking (I think - not
             sure on amount) $200g for their 100th anniversay permanent trail
             marking/tourist/something... it's a match to Feds and private funding.

             I will get this all on schedule .           I had a feeling that you would do Seward. I bet they
             were surprised.
