  Subject : McNeil River Bear Sanctuary (McNeil River) July 25-28, 2008
  Todd - I just was talking with Commissioner Lloyd in regards to the McNeil River Bear Sanctuary (McNeil
  River) that the Governor had agreed to do from July 25 through July 28, 2008. Commissioner Lloyd has 4
  permits on hold for the Governor and family at this time and needs to try to confirm this trip. If the
  Governor is unavailable to go the Commissioner would like to give these permits up so others can use
  them during this time. It is "tent living" -just the basics during this trip. Thanks, Janice
