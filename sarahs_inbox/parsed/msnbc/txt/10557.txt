                 Governor - I have updated calendar to reflect Wal-Mart Event for today:

                 Location : Wal-Mart Store - 8900 Old Seward Hwy. - ENTER Front of Store - South end by McDonald's

                 2:00 p. m. beginning of event. Wal-Mart will present check of $25,000 (500 gift cards ) to the Salvation Army. The
                 Wal-Mart Manager is Marty Howard . Marty is celebrating 27 years with Wal-Mart Major Doug Pollerud,
                 Salvation Army Divisional Commander will be accepting the check for the Salvation Army.

                 They have chosen various families: Some work for the National Guard, one is a single mother of five, a child with
                 cancer, etc.

                 They will present check @2:00 p.m. - hope to have gift cards in the families hands by 2:10/2:15 p.m. Shopping
                 will then begin. If the Governor could help the families shop. I have stressed that since this was just asked of the
                 Governor to be present during this time that she not expected to give a speech. They may want her to say
                 "Thank you." I have also stressed that the Governor has other commitments and only has approx. 45 - 60
                 minutes for this event They understand that when she needs to depart that is fine. Janice
