           I'll add more when I see you in the office. It's a very good presser!

            Questions




           Joe / Kelly / Sharon / Rosanne:



           Attached is a draft summary of the legislation, a revised press release, and possible
           questions and answers about the legislation. I had to recreate these after a computer
           crash last night so they need some proofing and review.



           I have a meeting with Commissioner Schmidt at 8:00 am and then will be at LAW working with
           the drafters to make sure the final version is out this morning and matches up to what has
           been decided on.



           Can you take a cut at these docs and make any needed revisions? lprivilecled or personal Mater*a
           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

           Privileg   should be back from LAW and at my desk by 9:30
                                                                1
