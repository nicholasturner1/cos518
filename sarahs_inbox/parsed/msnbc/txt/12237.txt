           Sharon,

           Here is the response to Sen Stevens we just discussed with the Governor:



           "We have consistently said that the Alaska Gasline' project needs to get moving .    That is
           what AGIA is all about and it ' s working .  We've seen more progress on the project in the
           past few months than ever before .    Alaska now has obtained more detailed information on
           the project than we ' ve ever had , and that information will help the state make informed
           decisions as we move forward."



           Marty      ( on behalf of Tom , Pat, Joe , Marty)




                                                                   1
