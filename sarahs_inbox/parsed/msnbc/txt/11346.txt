             The Marine Highway system will continue to be an important part of our state's
             transportation system.  However, all state agencies and operations need to be fiscally
             responsible when providing services to Alaskans.  With fuel and labor costs continually
             increasing, it is a particularly difficult challenge for the managers of the Marine
             Highway to find a reasonable balance.
