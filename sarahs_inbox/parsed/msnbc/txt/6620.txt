        Dear Ms. Feeken:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        Way to go, thank you for having the courage to cut the budget.

        I beleive Anchorage needs a sales tax, and I don't beleive in throwing money at schools. I
        think they should be funded.

        Money alone does not improve the level of education our students receive. I was surprised
        to see all the request for extra funding requested for different school related items.

        Thank you again for making the tuff decisions.
