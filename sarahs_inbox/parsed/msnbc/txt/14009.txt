           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,



           Thank you for keeping a firm hold on the budget, especially with additional reserves. Any
           debt our state has incurred needs to be addressed first. Funding pet projects that assist
           special local groups are not necessary compared to roads, trooper and legal system
           assistance, education and energy needs of Alaskans.



           Some of my peers called you the "prom queen." It is now said used as a sign of respect.
                                                              1



                                                                                                                               1
                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0014491
