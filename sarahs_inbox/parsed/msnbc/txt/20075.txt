         Governor - I will be dropping off the updated speech for Saturday shortly to the house. I
         also received the pile of TA's that were retyped and will need your signature. Do you
         want those brought over or should I just leave here if you will be in this weekend?




         I also am awaiting the Disaster Declaration that once I receive via entail will need to
         come into the office to run off in final for your signature. It is looking like it may
         come through later this evening or tomorrow some time. I will let you know. Thanks,
         Janice
