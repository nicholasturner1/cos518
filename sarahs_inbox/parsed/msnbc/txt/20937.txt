        MESSAGE:

        Dear Governor Palin,rnrn2 wanted to thank you for being a moral person and the best
        example of a governor that I have heard of in my lifetime.rnrnl may be from California,
        &amp; currently am an ex-pat American living &amp; working in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, but
        I have heard about you here.rnrnThanks you SO much for cleaning up Alaskan government! I
        was afraid that there were no such thing anymore as an honest, decnet &amp; moral
        politician.  Yet, you changed my thinking.rnrnWistfully, I yearn for someone like you to
        clean up Californianl government which is full of corrupt people standing in line at the
        public plate of pork for food.rnrnAlso, in the future, it is our greatest wish that you
        would run for national office.rnrnYou are the kind of good, decent republican we
        need.rnrnFrankly, I stand in wonder at how you have taken on the usual powers in Alaskan
        govIt.  rnrnYou, Gov. Palin, are a credit to Alaska and America. I am proud of you.
        Please keep up the good work.rnrnWe just wi

                                                                1
