         Thanks so much John. Good information.



         If you can spare Larry for a couple of hours while he's up here, I'd like for him to sit
         with us in discussions regarding Alaskan media (and national)... I've asked Sharon and
         Beth to make Thursday afternoon available for that. And we may even let him return to DC
         afterwards.

         Regarding the Congressional delegation and Lisa Murkowski, we followed the roll-out plan.
         Within minutes of the press release, we contacted the delegation through their
         transportation staffers with the expectation that they would advise their principals.
         This is the normal way we have been communicating with the delegation on the bridges.



         The DC portion of the roll-out plan grew out of discussions with Juneau.                      Privileged or Pero
