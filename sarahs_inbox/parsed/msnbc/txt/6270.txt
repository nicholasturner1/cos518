        Hi Ivy,




        First off, I wanted to tell you what a pleasure it was hanging with your folks at the BBQ
        a few weeks back. My family and I really enjoyed ourselves. I don't know if you remember
        my wife Christi (from when the whole crew came to my place to prep for the Channel 2
        debate), but Christi really took a liking to you that day, and was bummed you couldn't
        make the trip up. I was too, I haven't seen you in so long!



        Anyway, attached is the doc I put together for Mike and the Gov last time around.



        As to the Kenai pool, in my opinion, one candidate rises head and shoulders above the
        others.

         to Mike Tibbles re:  judge questions . You had sent it to him back in February or early
         March when we were preparing to interview Kenai and Bethel Superior Court nominations.  It
         was very helpful. I've misplaced the hard copy Mike gave me.




         Also , if you have any thoughts on the current Kenai Superior Court nominations please feel
         free to weigh in. Peter Mysing , Carl Bauman , Bob Owens , and Chris Provost were nominated.




         Thanks,
