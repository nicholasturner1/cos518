        Hi J- when you get a chance, let's set up mtg with Bill Bjork and other NEA folks -
        Anchorage would be most convenient - I just ran into Abby Kellner-Rode and she says you
        should have info re: the NEA persons who'd like to meet. Next week has times available it
        looks like.



        Also, I'm doing another bird release thing tomorrow - is supposed to be at Potters Marsh
        again, after church. Pls note on sched when u get a chance. Thanks!
