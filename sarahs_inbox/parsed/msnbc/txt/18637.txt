          Governor,



          The sub-cabinet has been up and running since spring. The AO is finalized. I'll make
          sure it is in your office in Juneau when you get there on Friday.



         Thanks,

         Larry

         I thought we already formed the subcabinet with the AO... if it still hasn't been signed
         then pls set that up for a signing to take place in Juneau on Friday. is the AO ready to
         go?

               I didn't get Kate's email referred to in Tom's email. I suspect she wants a more
         agressive schedule for the State's response to climate change.



               Currently, we are forming workgroups who are advising the subcabinet in particular
         areas, including what are the most immediate needs in terms of threats to villages and
         state infrastructure.

               I am currently on my way to Seattle for the Pacific NW Clean Seas (Oil Spill
         Prevention) conference.  I will be back in Anchorage late Friday afternoon. Please let me
         know if you would like to discuss our climate Change actions and opportunities further. I
         would appreciate this opportunity.

              Governor,  I thought a lot about whether I should pass this on but decided you would
        want to see what the conservation side is thinking. I don't agree with all the comments
        but a lot matches our thoughts and I respect Kate. Tom
