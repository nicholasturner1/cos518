            Dear Governor Palin




                  I am writing to request your assistance .  I have been a member of the Alaska Air
            National Guard since 1999. In 2005, after 6 years of service , I reenlisted in the Air
            National Guard and was awarded a re-enlistment bonus of $7 , 500. As a condition of this
            bonus I could not accept a commission in the ANG within a year of my reenlistment. In
            March of 2006 I interviewed for, and received , an undergraduate pilot training slot, with
            the Alaska ANG, for FY 2008.




                  Because the 168th ARW was undermanned for pilots at the time , my UPT package was
            rushed and I was required to receive my commission in September 2006, rather than in FY
            2007, as I was originally scheduled .   This was 3 months before the deadline for keeping my
            reenlistment bonus .  I have been instructed that the only way to not have to pay back this
            bonus is to have the United States Secretary of Defense excuse my repayment .   I have sent
            the Secretary a number of letters since January of last year when I was notified of this
            situation , however I have not received any response from his office .  I am writing to you,
            as my Commander in Chief , to see if there is anything that can be done so that I may avoid
            the financial hardship that will result from having to repay the initial bonus payment at
            this time.   Thank you very much for your time.




                                                                      Sincerely




                                                                     // SIGNED//
