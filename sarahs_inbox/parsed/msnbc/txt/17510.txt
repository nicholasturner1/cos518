        Governor

        We have an education funding proposal that is essentially ready to present.

        It has components that warrant discussion.. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

        That's the long answer .        Today I hope to start to reach out to key

        legislators to gauge their reaction to the political aspects of this

        proposal.

        Subject: Educ funding



        When we announce final educ funding level I will do a press conf featuring

        teachers . The message being : my goal is to get more money into the

        classroom ; the teaching profession will be honored and teacher profiles

        elevated on my watch ; educ is priority;        nothing's more impt than our kids; I

        want Ak to feel the same vigor for educ as we have for the gasline; we'll

        succeed in forward funding         ( eventually ); on our watch our students will have

        opportunity to be successful via our innovative educ reforms.



        I'm anxious for this. When will " early" educ funding be wrapped up?
