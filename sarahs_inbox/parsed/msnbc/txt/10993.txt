              I'm submitting a letter- they won't let me do a compass so soon after my polar bear one.
              Someone else should use your piece, or maybe they'd let you do so, so the public may
              better understand.

             Ok, if you're submitting a Compass piece.. .no need to go farther. They'll only print one
             response from us so no need to go to Karen or for me to send. Feel free to take sentences
             or paragraphs from this. I wont send unless you move on to other things and don't do.

             I'm submitting a letter. But share what u have with someone else like karen and they could
             submit- the more the better to explain the situation. Your's is an excellent response and
             it should be publicized!
