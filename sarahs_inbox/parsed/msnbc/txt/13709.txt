             She has Tuckerman all over this with him sending messages that this

             issue is somehow OUR fault- that people should be questioning the Gov on

             this- and that Lyda did nothing to stand in the way. His accusatory

             messages to others are unbelieveable, yet par for the course considering

             his mother-in-law has not had to be held accountable for anything thus

             far.

             Obviously an attempt to drive a wedge between us and the Senate

             Democrats as we discuss AGIA. Perfect scenario for Lyda as a cover for

             her failure.     She and Charlie can not get away with putting the failure

             of their organization on us. We should ask her if she is willing to pull

             a bill from committee or overrule her Democrats (actions that she has

              All,




              Lyda Green just announced on Fagan's show that she will send a letter to

              the Governor urging her to expand the call of the special      session to

              include the partial birth abortion/parental consent bill. FYI
