        Governor - Per your email concerning the meeting w/AT&T Meeting tomorrow a.m. (Thurs.
        07.12).   I have been working with AT&T to other time options per their pending travel
        schedule.




         The only time that they have available would be this afternoon @ 4:00 p.m. as they will be
         flying from JNU to ANC on today's afternoon flight.




        Would this be a possibility for you this afternoon? Thank you, Janice
