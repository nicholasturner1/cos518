                  To:       Sarah Palin; govpalin@gov. state.ak.us; 'Michael Tibbles'
                  Subject: Permanent Fund Corporation

                Governor Pal!n and Mr. Tibbles,

                I received a call from the Corporation and also from Commissioner Galvin regarding the upcoming meeting (next
                Wed and Thurs ). Galvin , as Commissioner of Revenue , is required by statute to serve on the board . Another
                seat should be filled by a "head of a principal department of the governor 's designation." In the past the
                Commissioner of DNR , Commerce or the AG has served as the designee . Galvin recommends Irwin, Colberg or
                Notti.

               I can let the Corporation know which commissioner will serve if either of you can respond back via email or phone
               with a name.

                Hope all is well back east!
