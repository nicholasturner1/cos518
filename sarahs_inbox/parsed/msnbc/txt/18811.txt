        KTW reports that we were wrong, BP was right - that fourth fire was really a flare. Did
        we concur with bp's insistence that it wasn't a fire, hence KTUU made that correction?



        i wouldn't have known the issue had I not caught it on the ten o'clock news, so I'm glad I
        wasn 't asked about it by any of the five reporters I spoke to yesterday - I need to be in
        the loop on "corrections" like that so I am prepared to address the issue if asked.



        Thanks
