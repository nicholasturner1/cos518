          MESSAGE:

          Sarah,

          It has been several years since we have spoken, but I always think of you fondly and with
          great admiration. I saw a picture of you and Tod and Trig in the Arizona Republic this
          last Sunday (I moved here in March), and wanted to extend my congratulations to you both
          ("Yashar Koach" in Hebrew). If you are asked to run for Veep, I will most definitally vote
          for you! If you make it to Arizona, I will come out to see you and hear you speak.

          God's blessings to you and Todd and the whole family.

          Love,

          Linda
