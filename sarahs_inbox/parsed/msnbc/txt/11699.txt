                 Subject: DOT Dust Control Project in Eagle

               Governor:
               Commissioner Von Scheben asked me to let you know DOT plans on going back to the community of Eagle on
               February 5th, holding a public hearing on the proposed dust control project, and if the community is
               overwhelmingly against it, dropping the project (The project and the communities opposition to it was the subject
               of a recent news story).
