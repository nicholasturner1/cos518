                Thanks very much for your response . I want you to feel comfortable with everyone
                here.

                So, I propose to o back to the drawing board for Allison's replacement. I will quietly
                try to determine Privilegprevious support for administration policy and also look at
                other possible candidates. More to come.

                   Change is good. Thanks for keeping me in the loop. Make sure Allison knows
                   (though it sounds like she's moving to another state) that she -just like Larry -
                   would be welcome to continue serving Alaska in other capacities/areas.

                   Thanks John!

                    Larry Persily has indicated his intention to return permanently to = Alaska
                    sometime this summer. He is not enamored with the public = policy process in
                    DC, particularly what Congress does and doesn't do, and = wants to involve
                    himself directly in Alaska life.

                    He asked me to emphasize that his decision is not related to the = Palin
                    administration or this office. Larry has been an invaluable = member of the DC
                    staff and is a good friend and colleague of everyone = here.

                    Change is always difficult, but I respect the decision of the = staffers leaving here
                    to pursue their personal priorities. I believe = that our new people are capable to
                    doing the same excellent work as = did their predecessors.

                    I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on the course of = action
                    outlined here. I have copied Larry on this email so that he = can add any
                    comments of his own.
