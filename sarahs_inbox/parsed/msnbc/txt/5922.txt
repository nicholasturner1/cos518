          Governor,




          He called the office today right before I headed over to the Mansion for the lunch. I
          just came across the note with his number on it and the message as I was gathering up
          things in my office for tomorrow's meeting. He wanted to know why he was let go.



          I will call him tomorrow.



         Joe

         I assume Mr Willard is a former BAC member? He was on the news tonight, saying I shocked
         him when I made an abrupt call to him to dismiss him this weekend. Hmmmmm. I've never
         spoken to him   whomever called him - what was his reaction to the explanation I'm sure he
         was given when explaining the bd was to be replaced?
