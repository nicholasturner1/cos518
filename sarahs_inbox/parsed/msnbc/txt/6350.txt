             Thank you - Mayor Combs for the invitation to the Palmer Pride Picnic.

             A big thank you to the many businesses that sponsored this terrific event! To the city of
             Palmer and the Palmer Chamber of Commerce - another job well done!

             It's always great to be able to spend time in the Valley during the summer!

             It is a privilege to be with you here today. And It is truly an honor to be able to congratulate
             the 2007 Palmer Citizen of the Year - Mary Jo Parks!

             (If she is there)

            Thank you, Mari Jo - for your incredible dedication and commitment to our community and
            residents who have been touched by your kindness and generosity.

            Please know that your commitment to our community does not go unnoticed by many who
            have been touched by your dedication to our youth and families

            Your work with the Mat-Su Special Santa Program and Halloween Hollow has benefited
            many families.
            The Special Santa Program truly makes magic happen. In 2005, over 1840 children from
            683 families, ages newborn to 18, received gifts through the generous donations of people
            in the Valley. And I know thousands of kids have taken part in Halloween Hollow. As a
            parent, I thank you for helping to provide a safe atmosphere for our kids! Thank you for
            making these events happen!

            It is people like you - people who go above and beyond to help others - that make this city
            great . Again , I say thank you for giving back to your community.

            (shake hands)

            Thank you so much for hosting such a great event! I look forward to enjoying the picnic
            and visiting with you. Thank you!
