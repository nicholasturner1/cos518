           Ken:  thanks for your inquiries, and those in another email that you sent today on similar
           topics.  We have been consulting with the Dept. of Law this season and, as you suggest
           below, we will consult with them again directly in deriving a response to the points you
           have raised here.  Take care, DL.

          Your prompt review of the attached letter would be appreciated. It is my concern that
          ADF&G continues to conduct itself in a manner that is potentially illegal under State law.
          I believe a full and open review of these matters by the Attorney General Office may be
          necessary to resolve them.



          If the actions were in fact illegal then the administration in keeping with an open and
          transparent policy should acknowledge that fact.




                                                                 1
