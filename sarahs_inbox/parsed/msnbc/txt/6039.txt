        The DOD advised me today that they must delete the Iraq segment of = your trip to the
        MidEast due to the increased tempo of military operations.=   If you decide to proceed
        with the trip, Kuwait and Germany would = still be on the schedule. I was also told that
        you would be the = only Governor on this particular trip.



        My guess is that you will still want to go, because the vast majority = of Alaska National
        Guard troops are in Kuwait. However, I did not = want to make this assumption without
        asking you.




        I understand that you would like to bring approximately 150 pounds of = Bristol Bay
        Salmon.   My DoD. contact has no problem with this as long = as the fish are properly
        packaged.   I was also reminded by DoD that = you should bring lots of Alaska coins and
        lapel pins.   I believe that = General Campbell can help with this.



        I should also mention that, with the elimination of the Iraq segment, = you will probably
        return to DC on Thursday instead of Friday. = This might resolve the previous concern
        about getting you back to = Alaska in time for whatever you have planned on Saturday.

          When convenient , please let me know what you would like to.do, and I = will proceed
