           We'll no doubt just need the pie and coffee sitting there, we can take it feom there
           without burdening staff for extra efforts beyond that... it'll be that informal. Thanks

           Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staff's part. Todd and I can
           serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify reporters if we're doing
           something separate with them. I'm getting out of the loop at this point, pls just let me
           know the progress when the coordination is complete. Thanks

           I think it is a great idea. Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA

           pre-briefing at the mansion in January 07.

           How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of

           them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have

           made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!

             Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum
