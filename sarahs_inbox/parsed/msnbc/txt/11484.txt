             I'm good without the addition. I just wanted to see it as amended.

              And I know team members want time to chew on this, but as has already happened this
                                                                  3

              morning with KTW finding me at the NEA speech and wanting responses to CP ' s letter - we
              can't blow any tinmely opportunity to set the record straight , asap , and lay out facts
              when we are asked . Better yet , to be pro-active and anticipate what the public is wanting
              answered . Obvious to me is the public ' s questions : " why is she refusing to talk to CP"
              (not true , but that ' s what they ' re hearing ), and "is it true she just doesn ' t understand
              how to get this project built " ( shoot- don ' t defend me on this , but our team of experts
              had better be defended or Alaskans will continue to believe the big , pretty , expensive ads
              that CP pays for to tell Alaskans we're , essentially , naive, stubborn and idiotic).



              The response does need to be sent . It's fine , with minor corrections ... I don't want us
             to over-think the response and miss opportunity to speak to Alaskans. I WILL be asked,
             continually, until we release a statement.
