                 November 14th ADN:

                Gov.-elect Sarah Palin said Monday that she will ask Somerville to resign if he's still on the board
                after she's sworn in Dec. 4.
                "I'd talk to Mr. Somerville and I would hear his side, because that's a fair thing to do, but
                recognizing that this issue would cast a cloud over the work of the board, I'd counsel him to
                voluntarily step aside," she said.
