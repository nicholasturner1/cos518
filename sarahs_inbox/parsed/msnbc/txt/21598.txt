                 Governor,

                 I'd like to grab 20min with you to cover some Board spots that we've been working to fill or re-up . There are two
                 that Cora has set up for us, two task-forces that I want to finalize , and two other slots.

                 20min will be sufficient. Any time your sked allows.

                Thanks much.

                F
