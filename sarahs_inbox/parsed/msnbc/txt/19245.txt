               WASILLR -- The Wasilla City Council voted late Monday night to approve a

               resolution asking Mayor Dianne M. Keller to resign.



               The decision came after hours of testimony from the public , Keller and other

               city officials involved in a damaging report             from an independent law firm

               accusing some in the city of acting inappropriately in dealings with a privat

               developer.




               The resolution passed 4-1, with Deputy Mayor Kristofer D. Larson in . oppositic

               Councilman Doug Holler was not present at the meeting.
