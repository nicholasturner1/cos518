           Erika- hopefully there was no misunderstanding tonight- I heard after the event tonight
           that you said I did not want you or staff there. That's far from anything I said. I just
           wanted to make sure you knew that with all the staffers attending the reception, there
           would be plenty of assistance to clean up, etc. Please make sure Diane and Suzi know that
           also.

              Just trying to not burden anyone with last-minute plans that are usually out of my
           control even. It all went well, the food was great, pies excellent... and never meant for
           you to believe I didn't want you there. Thanks
