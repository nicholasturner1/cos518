           just tell Kyle that the results dont surprise me (assuming it says Anchorage) and thats
           where it should be then.

          Governor,

           I know it's a little late in the day, but can you commment on this letter from Rep. John
          Harris on the location of the special session? In it, he says many House members want it
          in Juneau but says there is a "consensus among many House members" that you should make
                                                       1




                                                                                                             PRA GSPOI_0003769

            the call , not them.



             So, I guess the questions would be:



             * Have you received any input from the Senate on where the session should be?

            * Do you agree with House reps who say the governor should be the one who decides the
           location of the session?

            * How will location be decided ? Will it be the location that the majority of legislators
           want , or will it be more complicated than that?

             * When do you expect to decide where it will be?



            I'm writing a short story for tomorrow' s paper . The letter,       and Harris 's poll of House
           reps are attached.



            Thanks!

            Kyle
