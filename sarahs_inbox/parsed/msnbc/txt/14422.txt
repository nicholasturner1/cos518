           MESSAGE:

           You go, girl!!! Congratulations on your new baby boy Trig, and God's blessing on you, him
           and your whole family. I don't know if you, like I, were over forty when giving birth to
           your fifth (our Pierson, #5, is also a boy), but when faced with the question of testing
           during what was deemed a "high-risk pregnancy", we didn't even bother. We figured he was
           our baby no matter what the details. Being in the public eye as you are, your Godly
           choices and right thinking provide the example that thousands of words could never
           accomplish.  Know that there's a whole crew of women at Christ Church, Lake Forest,
           Illinois who are hugely proud of you as a woman in our corner

            I do not live in your state but I do want to wish you and your family all the blessing
            possible for your positive exceptance of your 5th child. We have.one granddaughter that
            was borned with Down Syndrone and we feel blessed everyday because of her. She is a grown
            lady now and is working and enjoying the life that God gave her. A hug from Courtny is
            worth waiting for. The love you give her will be repayed many times.

             Our prayers are with you and I know you will be blessed many times in the years to come.
