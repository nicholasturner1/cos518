           Dear Governor Palin,

                    Former AG Havelock sent me the attached letter. So, I had lunch

           with him today .        He reiterated his points in person and I listened. I

           do not confirm or deny what we are or are not doing to him and he

           respects my silence on internal matters .           In any event , I pass his

           thoughts on to you , I think you have been doing most of what he suggests

           - it is interesting how he perceives things.

                    Have a nice weekend in the snow.

                    Talis
