             Wow!  See how the rank and file is so different than their leadership? Amazing. Still
             amazing though that they chose not to consider the 40 hr.

            Just making sure you got this - I just bounceback saying the message I sent earlier didn't
            get through to you.



            I had thought we were on the road to a strike, but 85% of the membership voted and the
            majority voted to accept the terms.
