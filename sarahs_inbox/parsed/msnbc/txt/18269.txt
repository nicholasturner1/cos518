          Dear Mr. Sutton:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

         One more would have made it even better. The $750,000.00 for the Soil and

         Water Districts.       I"ve been on the Kenny Lake Soil & Water Board off and on for

         over forthy years and for most off the time there was no Federal or State Funds

         for the Boards. There could have been some at the State Board Level, but none

         for the local Districts.

                When Uncle Ted provided Federal Funds, it just creasted a lot of government

         jobs that the State would have been better off without.



                                                         Thank you,
