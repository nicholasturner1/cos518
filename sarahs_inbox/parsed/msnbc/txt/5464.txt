            Alan stopped in today to sign the resignation letters . We can now move forward with sending nominations back
            east.

            North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission : Submit one nomination. We were considering Privileged or
            Because this appointment comes directly from the president it could take some time to get the new person
            appointed . Alan said it took two years before he was officially appointed . An acting board member selected from
            the Commission served until he was appointed.

            Berin g Sea Fisheries U.S. Advisory Board : Submit two nominations . We were considering Privileged or Personal 1
            and Privileged or P One has to be a preferred choice . Travel and lodging expenses for this board can't be paid
            through the Office of the Governor. Earl Kreiger in ADF& G manages a federal grant that is used for travel to
            board meetings.

            Thanks,
