          I'll need the address of that AK Wild Salmon restaurant, and any other ASMI-related
          entities that are involved in promoting our seafood. Thanks



          And if it works out to be there, pis let the owners know that this will be my "belated"
          tour of their new restaurant, since I couldnt make it to the true grand opening event.
