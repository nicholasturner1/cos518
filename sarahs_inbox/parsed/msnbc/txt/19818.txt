               In a hurry, just some throwdown thoughts .... fractured thinkingl!I !! On the run..

               From Paul D. Kendall

               To: House and Community affairs




               THANK YOU GOV..... My continued support , so far!

               The 1200 is a reasonable and practical form of resource generated wealth distribution and i thank her
               again..



               Ms Faircloth and chairpersons,,,. I have been reflecting on last weeks testimony ,,to the issue at hand....
               Well, i am not sure you can addresss the issue without having toy hear the pain... my cup runneth over....
               out of the pain testimony may come our answer, or should i say ,your answer... I already have mine and i
               am simply listening to see if i am wrong or left out something....



               before I begin , AEA and S. Haagenson, Testimony and public participation ... Not There..

               You guys in Juneau , no major state wide people owned CNN type channel for us to hold participate ...just
               stupid if not lazy

               However: this does not address the problem because it does not define the problem!!



               We all know what the problem is ....

              Our leadership and our inability to hold them accountable for their actions .....which are a result of our
              dead asses not geting up and geting involved to make a better and more free community .....OR, even
              passing mandatory 10 to 15 year prison terms for public officials who betray us..



               Nearly all of us have forgotten that the Energy belongs to us - Not some child like, fantacy, farcical,

               imaginary and fictitous Corporate god like proviker like Rick Ridel, Dan Fagen or Dick Cheney would and
               do pound into you everyday....



               Those who would scream or whisper ,,,,, free loader, socialist, communist, want something for nothing,
               lazy, gimmee-gimmee , free market haters, corporation haters,



               are some of the most dark minded , entelligence lacking , insect like understandings , little minds i have
               met.. They have never really been a father, owned a business, felt a calling to serve a greater good, or
               tried to ponder a larger picture of life....

               I feel sorry for them unless they hold a means of public information or public office or other public
               interests impact... then I ususity get upset...



               NUMBERS show me the Numbers in your mind.... what and where is your thinking.??



               1 billion =   1,000, 000,000.oo

               1MW of electricity will do 1,000 housing units -

               I (large ) MW of electricity costs around , say 3 million dollars ,,,,, soo divide 3 mill into



               1,000 million and we get

               333 MW of Electricity which can provide 333 X 1,000 housing units annual electricity

               which IS IS IS




               333,000 housing units could have a reasonable amoount of annual electricity near y for free for 25 to 50
               years out..

               Now, how many housing units are there in Alaska ?

               (Have you studied( the # of housing units in the 2 , 000 census? @ 260,460)



               So why would we give away I billion dollars for no resolve ? But even worse you are depriving 333,000
               dwellings of nearly free electricity for 25 to 30 years ??



               THE INSANITY OF IT IS JUST STAGGERING 111! IT CLEARLY 13 A LEADERSHIP PROBLEM...

               ANY LEADERSHIP REQUIRED PROBLEM WHICH REFLECTS SUCH THINKING MAKES ITS OWN
               CASE FOR A PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP ROLES WHICH CANT THINK..

               OR ARE AFRAID TO THINK...

               OR ARE DELUSIIONAL

               OR ARE SECLUDED FROM THE GENERAL COMMUNITY OR PUBLIC WHICH IS WHERE OUR
               SOURCE OF ALL THINKING IS WEIGHED AND TESTED...



               SO BY OUR LEADERSHIP CLOSING ITSELF OFF FROM THE PUBLIC CLOSENESS THEY HAVE
               BROUGHT ON THESE PROBLEMS TO US ....
