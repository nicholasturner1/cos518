        Ivy: Ok - got it. We'll keep him,           Privileged or Personal M   a few others, in mind for openings.



        I'm anxious for     Privileged or Personal Mate!1 , etc to get plugged in to various boards.


        I'm sort of dreading the Fairbanks agia signing in June if we still dont have something
        for Privile a by then. I'll bug Commissioner Irwin about him again!

       William "Bill" Stokes, PhD is the man Mayfield mentioned to you in a meeting

       with the Rev, and Kris Perry a few months ago. Mayfield followed up with me

        to let me know Bill would be a good candidate for several of the boards,

        specifically for PFD.        To date Bill has applied for Regents and PFD.           He

        hasn't applied formally through this office for employment.              He's from

        Anchorage, it's interesting he would drive out to the Mat-Su office instead

        of talking to Kris in ANC.

        I'll ask Kari on Tues if she's heard from him - I can't recall who he is and

        I doubt he's contacted her either.

       Colleen,




       I have not had contact with Bill in quite some time. I know the Governor

       committed to hiring a rural advisor during a speech here in Juneau at the

       ANB hall but I don't believe it was her desire to rush into hiring someone

       to just fill the job. Finding the right person is very important. We will

         consider anyone that would like to apply but I intend to do some outreach

         and solicit names in order to have a good talent pool from which to select.

         If you would like, you can check to ensure he has his information submitted

         to Ivy.     Thank you.




        Mike

        Hi Mike, have you had any contact with Bill Stokes in Juneau ? He has called

        here and come by a few times . He is trying to set up something with the

        Governor as a rural advisor. He is pretty well known in Bethel according to

        Don Young ' s office . What do you want me to tell him??

         Hello Colleen.




         Thank you very much for taking the time to meet with me this morning.

         Hopefully I will be able to be of assistance to Governor Palin as she

         develops her rural strategy .         I also believe that Governor Palin would enjoy

         the mementos and imagery stashed in my home office .            It also occurred to me

         that you also may find my office and Sally ' s studio interesting.                If you

         have kids , we have a 14 ' x 20' tree fort out back that is just perfect for

        water balloon wars .       Call me when you get the time to drop in.




        Again, thank you for taking the time to listen.




        Bill.... .




        Bill Stokes REM CEA
