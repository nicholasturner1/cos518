            Let em know there's (evidently) a disclaimer at the beginning of the book explaining it's
            not a Gov's Office piece of work.

            You bet, Governor. We're on it. We'll have a final for you to look at

            by tomorrow afternoon, I'm hoping. Maybe we can give Matt Z a call and

            give him a heads up that it's coming. He will definitely allow us to

            respond.

             Governor,   here is my op-ed for Kris' signature. I've sent it around to

             others for their feedback, so there will likely be changes. Just wanted

             you to see what I've got so far.
