            MESSAGE:

            It is absolutely imperative that the governor take care of the abortion issue this year.



            The governor needs to either add this to the special session or call a second special
            session just to deal with this issue.



            It is MORE important to a huge portion of her constituency than any thing                else she can do,
            including a gas pipeline.
