          Sharon- pls correct Regan Scott's KTVA story last nite on Murkowski's comments re: her
          fears for gasline. Regan said "applications weren't coming in, so they pushed AGIA
          deadline back..." It was a cluster of a report she gave and Lisa's comments played right
          into Regan's story. Thanks. Remind Regan why AGIA deadline was pushed, and that apps arent
          supposed to come in 'til the last minute. Joe can help with the correction.
