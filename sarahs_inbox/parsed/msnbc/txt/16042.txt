                 Subject: Matt Zency - AGIA road shows

               Governor -

               Matt Zencey is asking how we feel about the legislative road shows. A commendable example of
               helpful public involvement or overkill designed to whip up pro-LNG or pro-Producer opposition to
               AGIA?? I say I stay positive and mention you will be attending as many as possible. Would you
               like to add anything?
