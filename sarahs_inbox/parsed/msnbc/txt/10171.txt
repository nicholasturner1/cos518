              I talked to Gary- he's checking on king air. Ridiculous that it's only been available for
              ONE of my flights since May!

              Apparently the King Air is out of hours and needs maintenance done in Seattle. After
              getting you back from Ketchikan on the 13th it will head directly to Seattle. it will be
              out for approx. 10 days to 2 weeks. Janice
