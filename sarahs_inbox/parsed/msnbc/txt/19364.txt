          That's terrible, Governor. As if they haven't stooped low enough on those blogs. I'm sorry
          for the distress this has caused. Sharon and I will discuss this and see how to best deal
          with this blog situation, as it continues to be a thorn in our flesh.

          Ok dokay- enough is enough. I am calling ADN, as Todd just called from Dlg and said Sherry
          Whitstine (aka crazy hater) blogged yesterday that "Sarah had an affair with Todd's best
          friend while he was on the slope". No, I haven't read it- others have - it's flippin
          unbelievable that the ADN allows lies like this to be posted. I'm calling.
