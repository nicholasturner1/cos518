        Below is copies of emails between my sister and Alaska Mechanical and NOVA Gold in her
        quest to find out what happened to her son. It is perplexing that Alaska, MSHA or any of
        the other parties involved would have 2 fatalities in the work place and be allowed to
        defer their accident investigation to MSHA. Since this accident there has been other
        fatalities including one in Alaska, and the timeline for this is what. Are employers
        allowed to kill people and postpone accident investigations, or defer that requirement to
        a regulatory agency? Who is responsible for insuring these involved parties are
        accountable and what is the time line. Who is the entity responsible for insuring that
        the Miners Bill of Rights is upheld? How many more people are going to die before someone
        can answer my family's questions.




        Please call me on my cell at any time 907-227-8298.

          Dear Michele,



          I share your frustration with how long the investigation into the cause of the accident
          will take . I also understand your paramount desire for this information.



          We are trying to bring closure to this matter for all involved but want to proceed with
          prudent actions.  Your attorney visit and their actions last week are testiment to the
          need to proceed with caution.



          It has been our stated course of action from the beginning to wait for the regulatory

          I am not familiar with the Minor \' s Bill of Rights and neither is our counsel.
          Irrespective of what it says , when the regulatory process is completed , you or your lawyer
          will be provided with all the information and conclusions we are provided with.     I
          understand Mr. Tulin , your family lawyer , already has obtained as much or more than we
          have gotten . As you know , he has also had experts inspect and test the manlift.



          As you pursue your various course of actions there will be some that AMI and I personally
          can help you with but others by their regulatory or legal nature will be outside of our

         Dear Kurt:



         It has been 80 days since our son\'s death, yet we still have not been provided any
         answers as to the cause from AMI, AGC or MSHA. The standard reply to our inquiries has
         been \"we are waiting on the MSHA report\". It appears that all other parties have been
         privy to much more information then the victim\'s families. Certainly you do not expect
         us to believe, nor would you want MSHA to believe that AMI has ceded its responsibility
         for investigating this fatal accident entirely to MSHA, if for no other reason than to
         prevent another one and to prevent a potentially dangerous piece of equipment from making
         it\'s way back into the workplace somehow. Responding to our inquiries with \"we are
         waiting for the MSHA report\" is no longer acceptable.



        Please let this correspondence serve as our official request, as per the Minor\'s Bill of
        Rights, Section 103 (d), for copies of all records, including pictures, emails,
        correspondence, and equipment maintenance & certification records, that were used to
        investigate this accident and to determine the the cause and any contributing factors. In
        your response also includes copies of pictures and any other supporting documentation to
        prove or disprove your conclusions as to the root cause.



        Your prompt attention to this request would be appreciated. To avoid any longer delays

         Subject: RE: Correspondence to Kurt Imig



         Dear Ms . Kahle,




         Let me start by expressing my sincere condolences for your loss. The accident and the
         loss have deeply affected those on site and the Management of Alaska Gold Company and
         Novagold Resources, Inc.



        I received two e - mails from you on Tuesday , October 9 , regarding correspondence between
        yourself and Kurt Imig of Alaska Mechanical , Inc. ("AMI" ).    In the first you made a
        request to AMI for information regarding your son\ ' s death on July 19, 2007, at the Rock
        Creek Mine - including " copies of all records , including pictures , emails , correspondence,
        and equipment maintenance & certification records , that were used to investigate this
        accident and to determine the cause and any contributing factors" - pursuant to the "Minor
        \'s Bill of Rights , Section 103 ( d)."  In the second you forwarded Mr. Imig's response, in
        which he declined to provide further information , and therefore you have requested Alaska
        Gold Company (" AGC") to provide that information.




        I understand your reference to \"the Minor\'s Bill of Rights, Section 103(d)\" to mean
        Section 103(d) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act. As the employer of your son,
        AMI is the \"operator\" referred to in the Mine Act, and so AMI is the company that is
        required to conduct the investigation and prepare the report required by 30 CFR Section
        50.11.  AMI should be aware of their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation and
        prepare the required report.  There is, however, no statutory or regulatory deadline by
        which AMI must complete the investigatory process.



        I appreciate and understand your desire for additional information relating to your son's
        death.  AGC is also very interested in reviewing the investigation reports prepared by
        MSHA and by AMI. It is our understanding, however, that neither MSHA nor AMI has
        completed their accident investigations at this time.  While the lack of information can
        be frustrating, it is important to allow the investigators the time they need to prepare a
        thorough report.  Moreover, some accidents, such as this one, are more complicated than
        others and will, by their very nature, require a greater amount of time to investigate.
        Because the investigations are not yet concluded, however, the information you requested
        is not presently available to AGC.



                                                          4




                                                                                                     PRA GSP01 0006443

          I note that Kurt Imig stated AMI will provide you with the information and conclusions
          that they have when those are available. It is our understanding that MSHA will also
          provide a copy of its accident report to you upon completion of their investigation.



          Please let me know if there is any other way in which we can help.

         response, in which he declined to provide further information, and therefore you have
         requested Alaska Gold Company ("AGC") to provide that information.



         I understand your reference to "the Minor's Bill of Rights, Section 103(d)" to mean
         Section 103(d) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act. As the employer of your son,
         AMI is the "operator" referred to in the Mine Act, and so AMI is the company that is
         required to conduct the investigation and prepare the report required by 30 CFR Section
         50.11.  AMI should be aware of their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation and
         prepare the required report.  There is, however, no statutory or regulatory deadline by
         which AMI must complete the investigatory process.



         I appreciate and understand your desire for additional information relating to your son's
         death.  AGC is also very interested in reviewing the investigation reports prepared by
         MSHA and by AMI. It is our understanding, however, that neither MSHA nor AMI has
         completed their accident investigations at this time.   While the lack of information can
         be frustrating, it is important to allow the investigators the time they need to prepare a
         thorough report.  Moreover, some accidents, such as this one, are more complicated than
         others and will, by their very nature, require a greater amount of time to investigate.
         Because the investigations are not yet concluded, however, the information you requested
         is not presently available to AGC.



         I note that Kurt Imig stated AMI will provide you with the information and conclusions
         that they have when those are available. It is our understanding that MSHA will also
         provide a copy of its accident report to you upon completion of their investigation.




         Please let me know if there is any other way in which we can help.



         Sincerely,
