          David Gottstein did write you a letter that Pat and Tom received yesterday, but I forgot
          to ask them to forward it to me last night. I will get it this morning and send it to
          you... or at least a summary.



          Oh, and John Cowdery made an appearance in Juneau yesterday, but after the news last night
          checked himself into the local hospital.

         Governor,



          Later today (10:00 am AK time ), governor hickel is going to hold a press availability and
         come out strong against awarding a license to transcanada. Backbone is split with most
         folks on Gottstein ' s side ( and ours).



          I imagine we will be pressed by media outlets for a response . Is there anything in
         particular you would like to convey? I think the story is going to be overshadowed, but
         we likely can't ignore it. Short and sweet ought to do.



           Joe
