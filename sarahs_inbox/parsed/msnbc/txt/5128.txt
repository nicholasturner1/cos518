                 Subject: 727
                 Governor,

                 Commissioner Schmidt provided me the following information to pass along to you:

                 On the Westwind:

                 Hourly cost: $1,794
                 Max 5 prisoners . It cost $3,200 per prisoner for transport to Arizona. For prisoners returning on the same
                 flight, the cost was $1,600.

                 The Marshall's 727 costs $103,000 and holds up to 100. This last trip , they transported 100 prisoners to
                 Arizona with 30 returning to Alaska . The cost was $792 per prisoner.

                 Their plan is to transport quarterly to maximize use of the 727 until our prison is completed.
