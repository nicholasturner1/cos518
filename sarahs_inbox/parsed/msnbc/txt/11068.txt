              Governor - I just received a phone call back from Mr. Jim Bowles and Brian Wenzel's
              office.  They were moving meetings around and just were able to get back to me. They are
              able to meet w/you at 1:00 p.m. (30 min.) in your office today, Friday, 01.11.08. I have
              added to your calendar. Thanks, Janice
