         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor Palin:



         We where excited to see you elected as you had promised to be fair with commerical fishing
         interest.



         However, your apointment of Howard Delo from the valley is not fair and upsets the balance
         of the broad.

         This would further harm our livelihood.



         All we are asking is fairness on your part.



         Sincerely,




                                                                  1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0001142
