            This is a major victory . Coeur and the State had requested the Court to review a negative
            decision of the Ninth Circuit.



            Hopefully , this will make some new law that benefits mining in Alaska. The Court's ruling
            may also help in the ongoing effort to resolve outstanding issues through negotiation.



            This ' may well be worth a press release.

                   Kris, could I share your two emails with Senator Stevens? Together, they are an excellent
                   exposition of the situation and what we're doing about it.

                   I think he knows that none of us is the problem, but I'd like to confirm this with him.

                   I'm glad to read Senator Stevens message to the Governor. This " issue" was initiated on the Dan
                   Fagan show. In addition to Fagan, it sounds like it is being perpetuated by Gail Phillips and
                   Myrna Maynard . Their concern is over the lack of coverage in the book of Senator Stevens and
                   that it was intentional by me and the Governor. Gail stating that the Governor needs to apologize
                   to Senator Stevens.

                   During her chair of the commission, Gail initiated this agreement with Faircount Publishing. Is
                   was a "no-cost publishing agreement". Faircount makes their money from the advertisers. And,
                   they are not an "official" publication. The stories that appear in the book were done by local
                   authors contracted by Faircount . Mark Kelsey was able to provide some editorial oversight
                   (although not much as Faircount has been extremely difficult to work with). Neither myself or the
                   Governor saw the book before it went to print.

                   Again, I'm glad that Senator Stevens understands that this is not what they are trying to make of
                   it.

                  Senator Stevens has asked me to convey his thoughts concerning the Statehood book . I think
                  that the best way to do this is to transmit his email to me (pasted below ). I have also included my
                  response to him.

                  If you would like me to do more , please let me know.



                  I'll convey your thoughts to the Governor immediately.

                  I'm not familiar with the Statehood book. However, I have tried to become a student of the
                  Statehood effort, which is the premise for much of what I've worked on since my coming on the
                  scene in 1969 . So, if there' s anything you think I can do to set the record straight , I will.

                  I'm glad that last Saturday's meeting went well, and I appreciated your getting back to me so
                  quickly on the logistics.

                  John: will you please get word to the governor that i knew of the statehood book -and had a
                  comment or two about it.
                   I told those who commented that i had no problem with that publication . I am a candidate-and
                  while i haven't seen it and don't have time to read it i don't condone the criticism of it regarding
                  me.
                   Last thing i need is a dispute over my role in or since statehood. I'll leave that to historians.
                    I'm told the investigators were appalled that i have no diaries , no records of phone calls, and no
                  self-serving articles prepared by me.
                  Has you know some of my staff are over-sensitive about publications which don 't credit my office
                  with miracles.
                    Probably one of my staff or former staff on their own commented to fagan.
