             MESSAGE:

             I would like to speak in person with you about our veterans who are both old and young,
             who have fought and are and are fighting on foreign soil .  This is an issue that is non-
             partisan and was started before Knowles went out of out of office - that Murkowski washed
             his hands of but made sure to make a partisan issue of within quick time- and which is
             never going to be an issue here in the Anchorage Bowl /Matsu Valley , but is beyond your
             wildest nightmare in the rest of the state.



             I pray you will see me.
