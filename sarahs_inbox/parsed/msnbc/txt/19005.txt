         Governor:



         Follow-up on our conversation about changing Air Guard Commanders .                    Yesterday

         I concluded my discussions with Brig Gen Hart and Brig Gen McManus. We are

         making the change effective Oct 22           ( see message to all Air Guard members

         below ).    Both Tony and Deb are excited and supportive of the change. Thank

         you for your support in allowing me to make this change. It is the right

         thing to do for the Alaska Air National Guard. When we get the details

         worked out on the Change of Command ceremony, I will let you know. It would

         be an honor if you could attend and say a few words.



         Craig

         currently underway within the AKANG is unprecedented .             From reset ,   to BRAC,
