MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful baby. As a fellow parent of a child with Down
syndrome, I know you will be blessed. You will come to appreciate the little things that many take for
granted. My son is now 5 and will start Kindergarden in the fall. He has worked hard but is doing so
well. Academically, he counts to 20, knows all his alphabet letters, colors, shapes, and his address.
Behaviorally he is just like any other child, he is stubborn, wants to watch cartoons, argues with his
brothers and sisters, can be good when he wants to, and knows how to come up give a great hug
and kiss, tell you he loves you then ask for a cookie.

Your life has changed , but if its like mine he has taught myself and those around us so much.



Congratulations,

Dawn McGee
