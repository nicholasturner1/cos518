                 Subject: Sarah Palin-footage -UTMOST IMPORTANT, PLEASE RESPOND


                Dear Campaign manager,

                I know how busy you are , but this is a matter of utmost important, and so, at the risk of being a `nag',
                I will keep writing to you about it , hoping you are actually reading this.

               I HAVE GREAT, IN DEPTH, INTIMATE FOOTAGE OF SARAH PALIN which I shot a few month
               back in Alaska, at her office and home. It was done-of course with her full cooperation and includes
               in depth interviews with her, her husband, at home, in office, and shows her in a very positive light.

               In the coming days the media will and already is attempting to explore the `dark ' side of Sarah Palin,
               throw some `mud in her face' and try to taint her great reputation and name . The footage I have can
               really counter that in a very effective way. AT THIS POINT, WITH ALL THAT IS COMING OUT,
               I TRULY BELIEVE YOU NEED THIS FOOTAGE TO BE OUT THERE.

               When I filmed Gov. Palin, I had her sign a customary, standard release form as is always the
               procedure in such shoots; however it was misfiled during my move to a new office.

               PLEASE, relay this message to her with my deepest support and congratulations , and ask her to sign
               the form which I will fax to whatever number you tell me to.

               Ms. Palin is a public figure, and the footage is very positive of her, so no harm will be done if I use it
               and distribute it as is, especially when it 's very clear and obvious it was done with her FULL and
               UNLIMITED consent, corporation and willingness, but I really want to be coordinated with her, and                    t
               follow the most smooth pass . I ONLY HAVE HER BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

               Please respond as soon as possible , now is the time to act.

               Thank you for your quick respond and cooperation in the matter.

               Sincerely,

          Governor:



          Alaska this morning launched one of our C-17 aircraft, carrying two HH-60

          PaveHawk helicopters and 30 Alaska Air National Guard para-rescuemen in

          response to a request from Louisiana for state National Guard support. They

          will arrive at Meridian, Mississippi this afternoon and be deployed from

          there in response to Hurricane Gustav.



          Obvious first point is that this shows states supporting states, especially

          in time of crisis. You as Commander-In-Chief of the Alaska National Guard

          are providing this support in accordance with the federal Emergency

          Management Agreement Compact (EMAC), which all 50 states are signatories to.

                                                                 I




                                                                                                           PRA GSPO1_0023724

           Second, this demonstrates your oversight of both tactical assets, the

           helicopters and para - resecue people who will do the mission on the ground,

           and your strategic assets, the C-17 airlifter which has the capability to

           transport this equipment and personnel worldwide in minimum time..



           We also deployed our Civil Support Team to St Paul to provide support to the

           Republican Convention .       This is also an effort of the National Guard Bureau

           to support state requests for assets.



           If there is any further information you need, please .let me know.



           Hope all is going well.

           MG Campbell,



           The C-17 was in the air about 0930L.

          We are ready for your signature.

           It is under the tab called "section II" and line 5.



          After you sign it, would you fax it back to 428-7356.

          LA EMAC is going to sign everything once they get your signature.

           It's a little backwards, but it's how they'd like to do it.
