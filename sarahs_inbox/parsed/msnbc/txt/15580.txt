            Governor - I wanted to let you know that I received a call approximately 20 minutes after
            you had left Elmendorf ( Marines Deployment ) yesterday . The Major called to just once
            again thank us all for putting this together on such short notice. The Major stated that
            once you had given your remarks and interacted with the Marines and Families he knew that
            those being deployed were now okay with going .   It was like a peace had settled over them.
            It is so great to receive these kinds of calls and I wanted to make sure this was conveyed
            to you.  Janice
