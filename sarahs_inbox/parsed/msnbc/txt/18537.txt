         Good evening Governor,



         I've attached very PRELIMINARY information regarding our current costs as compared to
         prior administrations as requested in prior emails.  We are still working through travel
         documents and will need to go through flight logs and public safety billings to obtain
         complete information.  I hope to provide the full scenario by mid-week. We will also
         provide more detailed travel scenarios specific to Anchorage travel and costs that I
         believe will provide a more accurate comparison between the administrations.




         I apologize again for the delay Governor, but we still have a significant amount of
         documents to work through.



         If you think of any additional area of comparison , please let me know.



         Thank you,

         Linda

         Subject: Anchorage office



         How close are we to having the numbers showing #of days former Gov(s) spent out of Juneau
         compared to my travels/housing expenses? The public deserves clarity on this as the
         misperception is I'm "living and working" in the Valley. If, as Security and
         administrators tell me, Murk and Knowles also worked out of the Anchorage office and spent
         many, many days out of Juneau - then the fair comparison needs to be made and presented.
         The other missing point in the coverage of this issue is that the Anchorage office is the
         workplace.




        When I requested this info a couple of weeks ago I wasn't sure who was heading it up -
                                                                 1

                9-07-07

                Very preliminary information relating to prior administrations comparisons... we are still
                working through documents to sort out the travel information, including the public safety
                billings for flight charges. The preliminary travel costs reflected here are for per diem
                reimbursements and commercial transportation expenditures only.

                Governor Palin days out of Juneau since taking office through 9/4/2007 are 173.

                       The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this
                       travel is $28 ,446.46 **NOTE: does not yet include public safety charges for any
                       King Air Travel.

               Governor Murkowski's comparable timeframe comparison:
               Days out of Juneau from taking office through' 8/24/2003 was 124.

                       The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this
                       travel was $ 18,553 .32 "NOTE: no public safety charges yet included .. Governor
                       Murkowski only had two trips with commercial airfare costs within this
                       timeframe. There will be considerably more costs when the flight logs and
                       billings are calculated.

               Prior administrations annual travel by calendar year without the public safety billing
               information:

               Gov. Murkowski
               Additional 2003 travel          70 days out of Juneau        $17,571.16 cost
                          2004                 178 days out of Juneau       $29,213.13 cost
                          2005                 202 days out of Juneau       $44,607.74 cost
                          2006                 193 days out of Juneau       $52,065.79

               Additionally, Governor's Office maintained an apartment in Anchorage for Governor
               Murkowski from May 2005 through November 2006 at a rental rate of $900.00 per
               month.

               Gov. Knowles (Days out of Juneau estimates only based on reported per diem - travel
               documents have been destroyed. Travel information from annual travel reports.)

                              1999             80 days out of Juneau       $57,392 WITH King Air billing
                              2000             152 days out of Juneau      $89,578 WITH King Air billing
                              2001             163 days out of Juneau      $55,490 WITHOUT King Air
                              2002             148 days out of Juneau      $28,876 WITHOUT King Air
