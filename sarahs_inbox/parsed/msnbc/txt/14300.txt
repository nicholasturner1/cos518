            Governor, I absolutely trust your thoughts on this issue and we will stand with you. it
            sure looks to me that they want to hold the Administration and with enough delay AGIA
            hostage with the budget/veto decisions. We keep hoping for responsible actions from some
            of those in the leadership for the benefit of Alaskans but they continue to work for their
            own selfish gains.   The whole budget process with the legis remains an uncoordinated
            mess . As always thanks for standing up for what is right!   Tom

            Press/Alaskans may need to hear about this- it's a major ploy to distract and sink AGIA.

            Wow. Major maneuvering going on. Designed to hurt AGIA -- sure sounds like it.

             Governor - the back up was due today but they have had to extend. Latest we heard is that
            we will not get the back up until the bill is transmitted. I do not know when that will
            happen but expect it within the next week to ten days. I believe the legislature will want
            you to have to act while they are in special session.

            about the timeline for the bill before cabinet on Thursday. KJR

              I thought back up info was due today ? Also- when can I expect to be handed the budget,
            thus giving me the ticking 20 day clock for vetoes?
