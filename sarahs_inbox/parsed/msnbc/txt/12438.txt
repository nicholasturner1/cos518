                 I have relayed the meeting time and place to Chuck Hamel and he says he has

                    Governor, this is Bre. I am monitoring John's correspondence while he is out of
                    the office.

                    Upon reading your email, I spoke with Chuck Hamel and he indicated that he
                    would be able to meet with you anytime after 1:30pm today - that's how long it
                    would take him to get medically ready and travel to DC to meet with you. He
                    promised that it would be a short meeting.

                   If you could let me know a time that is truly convenient for you, I will relay that
                   message to Mr. Hamel and try to set up an appointment for the two of you at the
                   JW Marriott - if that is also convenient for you.

                    He is awaiting my call with confirmation of a meeting time and place.

                    Regarding a meeting with Chuck, he left a request on my office voice mail over the
                    weekend. He lives in Northern Virginia. He hasn't been in good health, but I'm
                    sure that he would make it to a DC meeting if you want him to do so.

                    If you are interested, we could contact him and try to set something up at the JW
                    Marriott.

                    Regarding your question concerning new developments, I think Chuck's basic
                    contention is that the State's regulators are unaware of several relevant
                    circumstances, as reported by Chuck's network of workers. The attached letter
                    to Congress seems to be a combination of situations where he alleges that the
                    State has misunderstood the consequences of certain events or was unaware of
                    them.

                   Senator Stevens has asked me to meet with him this morning on earmarking
                   policy and perhaps other issues. So, Larry and I will be out of the office for a
                   while beginning at 10:30. If you want to meet with Chuck, Bre can help arrange
                   a mutually convenient time.

                    Sam and I talked about events over the weekend. Privileged or Personal Material Redact

                   Per Chuck Hamel's request, I have attached his latest correspondence to
                   Congressmen Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier
                   letter to the House Energy Committee.

                   I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.

                   P.S.
                   Governor, in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with
                   you during your DC trip.
