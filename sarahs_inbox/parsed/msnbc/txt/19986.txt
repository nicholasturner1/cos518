               Governor - We have been asked to do a PSA Taping for the Alaska Food Bank. We have the script ready and
               the video guys had a great idea of setting something up to tape at the house - i.e. It would be a great visual to
               have you carry in a paper bag as you read the script - kind of like you are coming home with the groceries. It
               would be a great visual for the TV version.

               I know we have two events at the house tomorrow - so this could be set up for Thursday or Friday around the
               lunch hour. Thanks, Janice
