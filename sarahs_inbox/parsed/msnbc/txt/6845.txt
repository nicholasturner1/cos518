                We met this morning with Conoco and Marathon, at their request, to
                discuss their application to the Department of Energy for an extension
                of the current export license for Cook Inlet natural gas.

                They expressed concern about the three conditions postulated by the
                State in its motion to intervene. The companies cited conceptual and
                practical reasons for their concern but agreed that the issues raised by
                the State need to be addressed in some form.

                Picking up on my previous discussions with the Department of Law, I
                suggested that Conoco and Marathon request a meeting with the

                 Departments of Law and DNR to seek a resolution of the three conditions.
                 I said that the conditions represented important goals but that there
                 may be various ways to achieve them. I believe that the companies will
                 pursue this avenue.

                In addition, the senior leadership of the companies wants to meet with
                the Governor. I suggested that such a meeting might be most productive
                after the session with DNR and Law. At that point, we will have a
                better idea of what resolutions may be possible and what issues remain.


                As you probably know, the companies requested an extension of the
                initial deadline for public comment and intervention. The new deadline
                is May 8th. My guess is that we will see opposition to some of the
                motions for intervention.

                After the deadline, DOE is expected to issue rulings on the motions for
                intervention and also to issue a procedural order establishing the
                framework for the remainder of the proceeding. Per my earlier
                discussion with Daniel, I will stay in touch with DOE on the procedural
                issues for the time being.

                Please let me know if you need anything further from us.
