         Thanks for all your help and coordination today! It went very-well. I'll regret the
         Fairbanks press conf, please relay that to his office as I'll be in sunny (?) Juneau.
         Thanks again, sincerely.

         Governor,



         From all accounts, today went great. The Senator's office expressed great pleasure with
         how everything went today. While the Senator recognizes this is last minute, he does want
         to extend an invitation to have you join him in Fairbanks for the press conference which
         begins at 9am.



         My understanding is that you're leaving for Juneau tonight and I can pass that along to
         the Senator's staff, along with the message that you apologize you can't make it this
         time, but I did want to give you the option.



         Thanks,

         Meghan
