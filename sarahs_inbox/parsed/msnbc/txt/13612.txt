             Harold got this in the budget? How? If he spoke for me, saying I supported giving him
            $$$, he's way off base.

             If Harold spoke for admin and said we supported this, he's way off base and was
            deceptive.

              There's $4 million in the capital budget for ANGDA. I believe this is seperate than the
            $8 million the administration requested that was not included.
