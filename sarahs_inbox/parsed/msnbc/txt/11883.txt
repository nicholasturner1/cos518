                Dear Ms. Bottger and Mr. Tillery,

                     Thank-you for forwarding the Heller Amicus brief from Texas. I have read it. I like it. The Governor's
                position is absolutely in support of the Texas position . Please arrange immediately for my signature and then
                confirm to me in writing that Texas has received our endorsement and will add our names to their Amicus.
                Thank-you Tails
