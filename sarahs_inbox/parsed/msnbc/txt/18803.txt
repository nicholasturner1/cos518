            Nancy,
            We have received several applications for the Rural Affairs position. I have all the resumes that came into me and
            Anna. We are in the process of our internal review of those applications. I can't say for sure the timing of the
            selection process and whether or not a person will be selected prior to AFN. I will keep you posted.

            Mike

            Good morning, Mike-Senator Kookesh asked what was happening with the position? At the Native Forum in
            May, the Governor told the group that she would work on getting someone on board during the summer. Will
            there be someone before AFN? Did you get a chance to look at the resumes and names we forwarded up to the
            Third Floor-we had been sending them via Anna Kim? I have old job descriptions of the position that I could
            probably find if that would help.
