             Governor Palin




             I regret to inform you that despite our best efforts Agrium is not interested in our
            proposal to sell them natural gas in order to reopen their plant in Kenai.



             Please don't quote me on this, but Agrium does not seem to have any confidence in the
            USGS and DNR studies regarding coal thickness and gas content in the Cook Inlet Basin.



             We tried.



             Best Regards

             Bob Fowler
