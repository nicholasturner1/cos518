              Did he say it publicly, on record? Hopefully media picks up so Alaskans know of Kelly's
              wise discernment. How much us Pedro making$$

              Mike is right on tonight. He said he doesn 't want the ghost of pedro and daniel hanging
              around all special session so they should specifically say what they don't like about your
              hybrid plan. Daniel didn' t answer and pedro said it's not a real hybrid plan-not very
              convincing . Mike said , I think we have a trust issue here ...or words to that effect. I
              love it!
