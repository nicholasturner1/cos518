             They'd show up for pie and coffee, I'll bet! We could gather many good pies of many

             If we want to do something at gov's house tonight, tomorrow... let Erika and me know..
             Leggies and/or AGIA team may need a reprieve there and we can do anything from dinner to
             cookies to coffees to whatever helps in this waning days before House vote.
