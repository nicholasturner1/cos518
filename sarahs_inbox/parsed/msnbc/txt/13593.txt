           Subject:                 Budget message


           So we'll need to be proactive in our budget message and get out in front of the critics'
           message that you know is coming (from the leggies and our usual critics): that WE grew the
           budget unsustainably, due to the operating budget increases, and that WE have no fiscal
           discipline. Let's try not to have to react to what's coming, but get in front with
           messaging while explaining increases, including tax credits. And explaining again our need
           to reign in their capital spending via sensible vetoes.



           Again though, can we veto anything out of that final operating budget?
