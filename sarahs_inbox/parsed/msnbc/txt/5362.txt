                            Governor Palin Disappointed Over Passage of Watered -Down Ethics Bill
                                                 Calls It " Politics As Usual"


                March 5, 2007 , Juneau , Alaska - Governor Sarah Patin criticized the failure of the Senate to adopt
                Senate Bill 19 amendments to further tighten ethics legislation.

                Today , the Senate considered amendments and passed SB 19, Senator French 's ethics bill. The
                Governor's office requested that some amendments be offered today on the Senate Floor that
                would incorporate some measures from the Governor 's ethics bill . All but one amendment was
                rejected by the Senate Majority Working Group on a straight -line caucus vote.

                "I am very disappointed in the process ," said Governor Patin. "My office , in conjunction with Dave

                and comprehensive ethics reform . As I stated earlier in the session , I do not have any pride in
                authorship but I can not just stand by allowing lip service to be paid to ethics reform while
                Alaskans stand to lose."

                Governor Patin continued , " In one example , my office requested the Senate to adopt an
                amendment that would prevent executive branch employees from accepting any gift from a
                registered lobbyist. The amendment would not impact the legislature . I feel very strongly that if
                we are really going to clean things up, we must remove the ability of those individuals who are
                paid to influence decision makers from providing gifts . To not adopt the provision is absolutely
                outrageous."

               "My hope was that the Senate Majority was following our lead in setting politics aside and doing

                interested in politics as usual."
