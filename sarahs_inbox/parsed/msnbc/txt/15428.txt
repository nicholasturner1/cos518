          I called Fentie. I have no other info on a second (or third) call to make, except that
          Campbell is in China. So I'm assuming my one call is it. I'm driving into Anchorage now so
          if more Canadian calls were to be made, someone else make them please.

          Governor,



           There are two calls you need to make this morning. We spoke about three of them
          yesterday afternoon, but Premier Campbell is in China so a call to him is unnecessary. At
          7:15, a call to Premier Fentie is only a courtesy call to inform him of the. recommendation
          and commencement of the legislative side of the process.



           At 7:00 am I will be speaking with the COS for Minister Prentice. Once that pre-call is
          done, we will arrange for a time shortly thereafter for you to speak with the Minister
          directly.  That discussion will be a little more than a courtesy in that we should
          indicate that we would like to see them re-activate the Northern Pipeline Agency to
          complete the final authorizations necessary for TC to proceed (this is one of the
          significant advantages TC offers).



           Joe

           I must be the only one not aware of the plan here- all I have on any TC phone call is
          last night's note from Janice to call Fentie, and his phone #. Who is the other premiere
          to be called, what's his if, what time is the call, and anything specific he (or Fentie)
          needs to hear that beyond what I conveyed to Hal yesterday?

            Janice,

            Joe Balash and I thought it a good idea for the Governor to talk, personally to the two
          Premiers in order to tell them that her two Commissioners (of DNR & Revenue) had
          determined that TransCanada Alaska's project ( as presented in their AGIA' application)
          maximized Alaska's interests and would move the Alaska Gasline project forward. And,
          furthermore, the Governor and the Commissioners would be forwarding to Alaska's
          Legislature a recommendation to approve the recommendation that an AGIA License be issued
          to TransCanada.
                                                       2

            Sorry , I did not scroll down far enough to see the question .  I have an idea about how
          the discussion should go , but would not want to steer anybody wrong .  Marty, who is
          copied , should answer this question , as it was Marty who determined that the Governor
          should make these two Premier calls .   Sorry I am not of any assistance.

           Yes, this is all set up. She will be making calls to both Premiers Fentie and Campbell
         in the morning. I am fairly certain that Kris and Janice are aware of these two calls,
         but am copying them in case.

           I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call - who gave you this info and did
         they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



            Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on

          ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
          mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
          one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
          Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
