              Both approaches are necessary.

              Below is my proposed response to Carl Marrs. For several reasons ,              I have formatted it as
              a letter to the editor from you.




              I understand that this format involves a limit of 225 words .             I think I've hit all of the
              major themes , but there isn't much elaboration.

              Note to Palin :   ' Earmark' means money Alaska needs

               COMPASS :   Points of view from the community

                 <file:///C:\DOCUME-1\APMINI.1\LOCALS-1\Temp\XPgrpwise\478603E4gwdomgwpb100169716114363C1
              \ IMAGE_2 . gif> CARL MARRS - 01/10/2008

              I and other Alaskans have spent a lot of time trying to understand why the Palin
              administration would announce publicly that it was going to drastically cut the earmarks
              the state seeks from our congressional delegation . It makes no sense to us . By doing it so
              publicly, she may have jeopardized all other existing federal funding for Alaska.



              The Palin administration says earmarks make Alaska look bad . However , an earmark is
              nothing more than a word for special projects . And because our infrastructure needs eons
              to catch up with the rest of the nation just to bring us into some sort of parity, we need
              many special projects.



              Palin ' s cutback on earmark requests ( or special projects) will make it even more difficult
              to make things happen in Washington, D.C., and it's already very difficult indeed. Most
              people in the Lower 48 would just as soon see this state locked up in one big park or
              wildlife preserve . The last thing we need to tell Congress is: "We don't want your money;
              we have enough."



             The governor and many among our news media are painting a bleak picture of earmarks,
             suggesting they are there to be abused. Nothing could be further from the truth. Earmarks
             have been used for decades by many other senators from many other states and will continue
             to be used in the future in some other form . It's not like Sens. Stevens and Murkowski and
             Congressman Young have invented earmarks , or the projects the funding was going to be used
             for. These projects were requested by the State of Alaska or the residents of Alaska.




                                                                  3




                                                                                                            PRA GSPO1_0009708

              We elected our congressional delegation to go to Washington, D.C., to fight for funding
              for our state. It would seem that Palin's negative portrayal of the process has the
              potential to harm Alaska's stability and its future.

              On the one hand, Palin wants to tax the hell out of our biggest industries. At the same
              time, we need funding for infrastructure, health, education and public safety. By casting
              a shadow over all of it, she has now put so much of what we need at risk. Surely she
              doesn't think the state can pay for everything?



              I don't know where her advice is coming from, but it reminds me of the old fairy tale,
              "The Emperor' s New Clothes." If this administration keeps this up, eventually the people
              will see there is nothing there.

              in the case of Gov. Palin, most of is can agree she was a very attractive candidate who
              knew exactly how to appeal to the widest possible audience. When you're trying to get
              elected, that's a strategy that's obviously very effective. But we're not in an election
              (or are we?). We're at the point where the rubber meets the road. We're at the stage where
              we need more than rhetoric, more than promises , more than attacks on others. we need
              results.



              Gov. Palin, Alaska needs policymakers who have vision. Alaska needs can-do builders who
              can start a project and see it through to the finish. Gov. Palin, Alaska needs leadership.
              We want you to succeed on Alaska's behalf, but giving up on federal funding leaves some
              serious questions.
