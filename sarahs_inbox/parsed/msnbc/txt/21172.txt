          The wolf situation and the congressman with the televised opion can be put in there place
          and quieted quickly if we gift them with all of our excess wolves. I also think they
          should be shipped to California on the new Alaska Airlines Disney Plane as it represents
          both states. (Working together to solve problems, etc.) Congressman Miller of California
          seems very interested in our treatment of wolves. I see this as very strange behavior as
          he stands there in the heat on pavement with a wolf on a huge chain for his press
          conference convenience. Can we please send these excess wolves to anyone that wishes to
          try and tell us how to run our wildlife program. Maybe the next time an issue comes up
          they will be to busy feeding the wolves to interfer. Rinda Howell/Wrangell
