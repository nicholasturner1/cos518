             Hello all--- near and far

             Attached is the full-color version (.pdf) of the September City News.

             Those of you who receive utility bills from the city will receive a black and white copy in your
             envelope, but it's always nice to see it in full color.

             The pdf file is also available for download at www.mcgrathalaska.net where you can click on
             the tab on the left side of the page, to see the menu for current and back issues.

             And if you are a resident of McGrath, you are encouraged to consider running for one of the 3
             open seats on the City Council (2 three year terms and I one year remaining on another three
             year term). The "Declaration of Candidacy" forms are available at the city office. The election
             will take place on October 2nd.

             Have a wonderful weekend! And, good luck to all of you moose hunters!
