          I just forwarded both to you.

          Lauren has you on the list and we haven't gotten any "bounce-backs," but we'll make                       sure
          you are getting all of these when they go out.

          Governor:



          Sharon sent messages that these were ready to be sent out, so Lauren sent them.



          We'll make sure you are on the "blind" distribution list.
