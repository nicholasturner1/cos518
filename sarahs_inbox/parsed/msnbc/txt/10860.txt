             Thank you!  There may be a grieving period for some of them but if they'll go to the
             website and read the rejection letters they'll see the legitimate and fair reasons we had
             to move forward with TC.



             Thank you!

             I just wanted to tell you that you did a good job with what was a difficult moment at the
             press conference. I recognized (in what you were saying) and know the feeling of making a
             decision that cuts off the wishes of people you respect because your job and the state's
             interest require it.  That's a difficult part of leadership but you did what was right and
             I wanted to thank you for that. Never easy, eyes upward. You did well with a tough one.
