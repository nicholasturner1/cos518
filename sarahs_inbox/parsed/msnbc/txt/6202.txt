          Governor Palin:



          Ma'am,



          As of this date I have heard nothing in regards to my concerns, thus it appears the

          clique in the Alaska National Guard is still working!

          Thank you for listening, but please do not hand this over to the DMVA to handle

          because it will end up the same as Knowles Inquiry did, and that is the DMVA used

          it to punish those that stood up to the Clique!!!!!!!
