                Dear Mike,



                I am taking the liberty of e-mailing you because today is a state holiday and I assume your support staff is not working and
                so I could not be able to call you. I drafted most of this message before getting the order just issued by the court which
                orders us to do what I suggest below.



                This message is motivated by the filing you faxed to us at 4:08 pm last evening. As you can imagine my clients are very
                disappointed that the Lieutenant Governor has decided that he cannot comply with the court order.



                8/25/2009



                                                                                                                                      PRA_GSP0I_0006931

                Fw: Holman et. al. v Parnell                                                                                            Page 4 of 4




                 My clients believe that by a) delaying the decision to not certify the initiative until virtually the last day of the 60 days
                allowed, b) refusing to agree to our proposed time for filing his answer , c) seeking additional time to respond to our motion
                for summary judgment (which we agreed to) d) taking virtually the entire 60 days to address 07WTR2, e) the ongoing delay
                in addressing the validity of 07WTR3 which was revised to accommodate the states concerns, f) the failure of the state to
                object to the five day period we had in our proposed order g) the failure to take any action for two days after the court order
                was received, and h) the insistence that the petitions cannot be made available until the 29th of this month at the earliest,
                that the Lt. Governor has deliberately and intentionally delayed any approval of a ballot measure which might be related to
                large scale mining in Alaska for policy or political reasons. They feel he is trying to keep the people from having the
                opportunity to vote on such a measure. And they feel at this point that he has admitted he is in contempt of court. They
                have instructed us to seek an order to show cause and to compel sanctions. They are also exploring other methods to
                communicate their considerable frustration.



                Given the dates on the Division of Elections web page showing that petition books for numerous other initiatives have been
                provided in much less than 17 days they do not believe that 17 days should be necessary. The specific procedures outlined in
                the statutes and regulations do not require that much time . The drafting of a summary and the preparation of a cost estimate
                should not take long. While petition books have to be printed we believe that would it would not take 5 calendar days to get
                those printed. Indeed experts in printing we have consulted with think that numerous print shops could produce at least 100
                booklets overnight. And I note that the rules permit the applicants to pay for additional booklets to be printed if they think
                the Lt. Gov. has not provided enough.



                I am contacting you to explore the possibility of resolving this short of us asking the court to hold Mr.. Parnell in
                contempt and that significant fines and other sanctions be imposed.



               It would seem that with a few hours of concentrated effort by the Division of Elections, the summary and the cost estimate
               could be completed. The layout of the booklet should take only a few more hours. Printing could be started and the first
               several hundred booklets should be available within in a day after that. Alternatively perhaps agreement could be reached on
               interim booklets that could be copied on copy machines and could be used to gather signatures before the final booklets are
               printed. It does not seem that we need to engage in a huge legal battle if a bit of cooperation could resolve the timing issues.
               It may require a bit of flexibility on the part of the state and officials of the Division of Elections. But it does not appear that
               there are specific time frames in statute or other similar legal requirements that must be observed at the risk of challenges
               from others.



               In short I urge you in the strongest possible terms to get with your client and his staff in the Division of Elections and come
               up with a way that can accelerate this process and avoid the delay which you are now proposing and which is unacceptable to
               my clients. My clients may even be willing to help cover some of the costs if it means they do not have to pay me to pursue
               expensive litigation against the state.



               Can I hear from you no later than 10 am tomorrow? If we do not have a solution in place by noon tomorrow or very
               significant progress towards a solution, I am instructed to file a motion for order to show cause and to ask for significant
               financial and other sanctions.
