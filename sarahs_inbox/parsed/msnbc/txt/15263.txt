          I'll talk but it's unfortunate we have to rearrange out sched and plans for an unknown
          upcoming opportunity. And we may not walk the whole thing depending on Trig' s hunger
          level. Thanks

          Governor,



          Kelly can give you further detail on this, but Senator McGuire is unable to attend the
          bill signing and has strongly requested/insisted that we hold off for another date. The
          bottom line is, we will not have a bill signing at the MOD walk.



          The plan the sponsors hope you'll adopt is to be the last speaker before the walk begins,
          offer brief remarks, and then lead the walk with two families (one of which is the Kolendo
          family from Wasilla) who have received assistance from MOD. What I_ need to know from you
          is, would you like to only do the walk, or would you be willing to offer a few brief
          remarks, as well?
