  Subject: Out of town June 10-14 and Willow's fit.
  Hello Todd!

  I will be out of town to attend the NGA Seminar for Spouses' Assistants & Residence Managers in
  Richmond, Virginia from June 10-14th. I'll have my Blackberry and laptop with me, so you can reach me
  if you need anything . Thank you for letting me attend the Seminar! I love learning- so I'm really looking
  forward to networking with other Managers and Assistants, plus it should be a beautiful area to visit.

  Security just wanted to confirm that you were planning on picking up Willow from the Anch. airport on
  Saturday. Tom's taking her on Saturday. I thought you were planning on picking her up, but they just
  want to make sure.

  Hopefully you've already gone jet skiing this summer, especially with a lake right outside of your house!

  Thanks!
  Erika
