           existing refineries in the U.S.A........ We need to accelerate our independance with our
           resources as in the way we have done with our SPACE PROGRAM. Another way we could correct
           our ENERGY CRISIS is to have a "RECALL ON ALL MEMBERS IN OUR GOVERNMENT" (D.C.)...( THEY

          SAN FRANCISCO..ALSO, LET'S SEND SOME OF OUR ENVIROMENTALISTS AND LET THEM EAT A LITTLE
          SAND AND DRINK SOME OF THAT FOREIGN OIL ......... WE STILL PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE "UNDER GOD"
          AND "IN GOD WE TRUST"....AND WOULD NEVER SIT IN A CHURCH WITH A COUPLE RADICALS THAT USE
          GOD'S NAME IN VAIN-THAT CHURCH AND ITS CHEERING CONGREGATION NEEDS TO REMOVED FROM THEIR
          TAX EXEMPT STATUS .......... SORRY TO RAMBLE. . .BUT WE'RE TIRED OF THE COMPLETE GOVERNMENT
          SHAM .... WE ARE SELF SUFFICIENT AND KEEP OUR HOUSE IN CHECK. . .AND PAY OUR TAXES .... AND
          DON'T NEED SOMEONE TO TELL US WHERE TO SET OUR THERMOSTAT ...... AND IF WE NEED TO PRAY

           HOME ..... RESPECT THE PRESIDENT, AND OUR TROOPS ...... GOVERNOR PALIN ..... WE WOULD LIKE TO
           SEE MORE OF YOU ON THE NATIONAL NEWS....

          IN A VERY AGRESSIVE MANNER IN WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPOLISH...FOR ONCE, WE WOULD LIKE
          TO SEE SOMEONE ( IN LAYMAN TERMS )..TO PUT THESE IRRESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR PLACE
