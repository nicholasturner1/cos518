            Sheeesh- he did some injustice in reporting on the "pay raise bill" that was signed into
           law... his account of the issue in today's Empire is certainly not the way I read the
           issue. I don't support raises for legislators or the Gov's or LtGov's positions... if I
           missed something with the bill that Forgey claims I "quitely signed into law" (intimating
           there's something sinister about the issue ), then I got snookered into something perhaps
                                                                  1

           we should have spoken up against. Perhaps this one should have become law without my
           signature?
