          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,

          Congratulations on the birth of Trig! As a mom of a baby boy, Cole, born with Down
          syndrome a year ago tomorrow, I can testify that I believe I have only seen a glimpse of
          the positive impact he will have on my family's lives as well as this world.



          I am good friends with Sean Parnell from the days when we served on a Western States
          Legislative Forestry Task Force together. I sent him an e-mail as soon as I heard the
          news that Trig had been born with Down syndrome. The hardest part is hearing the news and
          getting your arms around a new reality. However, you quickly develop new hopes and dreams
          for your son.



          If over the next few days or weeks, you would like to talk, I would welcome it or if you
          come to DC, let me know, I would enjoy meeting you.



          God Bless You and your family!



          Cathy McMorris Rodgers
