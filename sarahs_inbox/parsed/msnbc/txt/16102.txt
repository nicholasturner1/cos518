            Governor,




            I just got off the phone with Colonel Talkington. I let him know that

            there was a concern that Track was potentially being singled out and

            that you wanted to be sure that all the troops received the same

            attention and honor. I respectfully requested that Track be removed from

            any "tour guide" role or demonstration lead. I also conveyed that you

            are very much looking forward to the tour of FWA, and that you

            appreciate all the hard work and preparation that's gone into the

            planning of this event. Col. Talkington understood completely, and

            agreed to speak to Track's commanding officer(s) and have him removed

            from any spotlight.



            Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. Thank

            you!

            True- this could have come from his own bosses mistakenly thinking this

            is something he'd actually like to do. :)

             So we'll get him off the hook with Roseanne's neighbor who happens to

            be our guide on base that day. Thanks

            Governor - I just talked w/Kate and we will call first thing in the

            morning to make sure this is sorted out. Track's name was not brought

            up at all except that you wanted to say hi to the company. I think his

            1st Sgt. may have taken this upon himself to arrange thinking that it

                                                                     2

            Very good . Track is begging that, at the most , we stop by his company to

            say "what ' s up" and that he not have his shift schedule changed just to

            accomodate our visit . He's deathly afraid of being given special

            treatment or attention ,       so please tell the Army brass that at the most

            we'll swing by and see his company but he won ' t be asked to hang with

            us. Thanks!

              He just texted me, nervous that his 1st Sgt told him we asked that he

             be our tour guide when we do the bill signings and tour of Ft Wainwright

             on Friday. I reassured him we did not request that he be put on the spot

             and under pressure to guide us - that any random soldier or top brass

             could do this. Track thanked me for that because he doesn't want to be

             treated any differently than other soldiers up there - so could we look

             into that and make sure our tour guide( s)          are less camera-shy than my

             son? I promised him we'd get him off the hook. Thanks!
