          Importance:               High


          Pat - do not let "others" keep demanding what I want to do anyway - and that's call the
          special session for ppt revisit. Tell Sharon, Meg, et al, that despite what John Bitney
          may have told Dave Donaldson and others about us NOT wanting special session (which has
          also led to all the speculation that I'm waffling on the issue), I have NOT waffled - I
          still believe ppt is NOT solid, and that word needs to get out there asap or it appears
          we're just reacting to Gara's newest press reelease , or the ADN's editorial, or Doogan's
          op-ed.



          I will ask Sharon to do a press release on this asap, to clear up all the confusion in the
          public, unless you guys can get the message out a better way, and sooner.

         Alaska Day is October 18, 2007. Sounds like a grand day to fix a problem that must be
         addressed sooner rather than later.




         The ideas expressed in your email reflect the promises I have made since even before
         kicking off my campaign on October 18, 2005.



         Look forward to hearing more. So far ,          sounds great . Thank you sincerely.
