          Sure. It's a start. Please feel free to tweak away, everyone. The word count limit is 675
          and right now it's at 587, so we have room to expand copy.

              Janice, if I'm reading the Nevada portion correct, she would leave Monday night and get into LV on Tuesday then
              departing for Philly on Weds. I would suggest a flight option that would get them in on Monday morning should
              they decide to go that route. Also AK flies direct there and it may be timelier and as cost effective to do it that
              way...???
