                 Mike:
                 DOT has been trying to negotiate an agreement with the airlines regarding use of the Anchorage and Fairbanks
                 airports. In the last month , both sides, the State and now the airlines have made some concessions and come
                 closer to reaching an agreement. The current main outstanding issue relates to agreeing on the amount of the
                 capital improvement project plan for Anchorage airport that the airlines will have to fund.

                 The laws and rules the airport operates under give the State leverage over the airlines . At any point in the
                 negotiations , the State can choose to stop negotiating and send out a proposed agreement to all the airlines.
                 Whichever airlines choose to accept it become " signatory" airlines and pay lesser fees and costs than airlines that
                 choose not to sign.

                 DOT has a letter in draft form that it wants to send offering to meet with the airlines on May 13 and May 14 to try
                 and reach a final agreement.
