          I just heard from Todd and I apologize with bothering you with these .                    I received J.D.'s
          cell number and already gave it to the store.



          Also , thank you for Friday night ,        I enjoyed being able to help, and most of all to sit and
          talk about things .  Janice

          MESSAGE:

          I had a young man come into the store where I work , Alaskan Fire &amp; Safety, back in
          March of this year, and special ordered a pair of goggles to be sent to him when they came
          in. When i commented on his name being the same as yours he told me he was your brother-
          in-law , J.D. Palin; and gave me an address of P 0 Box 201175 , Anchorage , Alaska , 99520. I
          sent it Priority Mail on April 11, 07; and now, TODAY, have gotten it back marked
          &quot;unclaimed &quot; ( another testament to our so efficient post office ) I was hoping
          that IF he was indeed related to you, that perhaps you could contact him and ask him to
          please call me with a good address so that I can get these delivered to him . rnThank you
          very much for your help ; and if you have any spare time, you just might take a look at our
          wonderful and efficient postal service! You've done an excellent job so far weeding out
          the flakes in our other &quot ; systems&quot ; so I know you could make some improvements
          there too!rn

                                          A loyal supporter ! rn                                                  Carolyn
