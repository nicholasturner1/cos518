           Thought I'd stop by at noon to see ya and to pick up that pic for the Island Pub.



           Pip and Willow came by my office the other day. Pip has been insisting since I was 24
           that I'm actually 25. Now that I'm 26 she still insists that I'm 25. So anwya, she and
           Willow come by my office, she half climbs up on top of my desk, leans forward on her
           elbows and says real serious, "Ivy, are you 26 now?" I said, "yep, I'll be 27 in July."
           And without missing a beat she says, "Oh my gosh, you're almost 30. When you going to
           start having babies?" I said, "well if you stop being so picky about the people I date, I
           might get married and have babies." HA.



           Anyway, turns out it was a fitting conversation. Have a good day and I'll see you later
           w/ or w/out coffee...
