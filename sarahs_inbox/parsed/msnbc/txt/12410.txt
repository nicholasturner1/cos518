             These sentiments should be in a presser - the legislature is tearing the rug out of my
            efforts to prove our ability and committment to the oversight that's needed before anyone
            can trust that ramped-up development of our resources should happen.

             Sharon- I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault ' s taking out PSIO positions and BP
            corrosion lawsuit funds out of my budget. Im back here in DC speaking with Cneney (sat
            with him the entire State dinner last night ), will try to speak w /Bush today ... speaking
            with national reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide
            sound oversight of resource development , as evidenced by PSIO , lawsuits to hold industry's
            feet to the fire re : waste of valuable natural resources , etc... and here while I ' m away I
            find out the legislature may undermine those efforts ? It's unacceptable if the nation is
            to believe we're capable of responsible , ethcial ramped up development that's need in our
            state, for our nation.
