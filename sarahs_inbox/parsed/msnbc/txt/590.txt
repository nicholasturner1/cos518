    Subject : Updated Regrets List through July 31, 2007

 Attached is the regret list that has been updated through July 31, 2007. We may have a few straggle in for the
 last days of July. Because this list is quite long I have made a copy for the Governor's Reading File that will be
 sent DHL on Friday, 07.27.07 and will be in the Anchorage office for Monday, 07.30.07. There are two questions
 for the Governor at the beginning of the list.

  I will send the regret list for August that we went over today on Friday, August 3, 2007.

 Thank you everyone , Janice

                      Governor's Scheduling List: By Tanice Mason
                        JULY Scheduling Updated - 07/25/07




      Governor, I received an email from Andrea Lang, Coordinator for Diane Benson
      for Congress Campaign. Ms. Lang stated that you had requested a meeting with
      Ms. Benson when she travels to Juneau. Ms. Benson will not be in Juneau in the
      near future and is requesting the meeting be held in Anchorage during the week
      of July 29. Please let me know if you would like to set this up for that time.

      Also, the 4-H Club will be holding a Live Auction on Friday, August 10 @ the
      Tanana Valley State Fair. A young lady (Ms. Hannah Graff -14 yrs. old) is
      asking that you bid on her turkey at the upcoming fair. You do not have to be
      present to do this. Ms. Graff also has a young cow to bid on. I think we may get
      other requests for this - please let me know your thoughts. Thank you, Janice
