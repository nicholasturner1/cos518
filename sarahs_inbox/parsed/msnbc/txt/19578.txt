                                 Governor Palin to Chair NGA Natural Resources Committee

                July 17, 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin this week was named Chair of the
                National Governors Association ( NGA) Natural Resources Committee . Montana Governor Brian
                Schweitzer will serve as vice chair. The announcement came as the NGA wrapped up its 100th
                annual meeting in Philadelphia.

                "I appreciate this opportunity and look forward to working with Governor Schweitzer on issues of
                energy , environment and natural resources," said Governor Palin. 'Alaska 's potential to continue
                providing a safe, secure, and domestic source of energy is great. I look forward to addressing the
                growing energy challenges with the rest of the nation's governors."

                The NGA Natural Resources Committee is charged with pursuing legislation to make sure state
                needs are considered as federal policy is formulated in the areas of agriculture , energy,
                environmental protection and natural resource management.

                Founded in 1908, the NGA is the collective voice of the nation's governors and is one of
                Washington, D.C.'s, most respected public-policy organizations. NGA provides governors with
                services that range from representing states on Capitol Hill and before the administration to
                developing policy reports on innovative state programs.
