            Mike will be contacting you re: the assistance needed as Stedman has put a stop to all
            Governor's bills, and you saw what Senate leadership did to the budget yesterday - actions
            that negatively affect your budgets, our agenda to move this state forward, etc. we do
            need your assistance here to have restored those things that will allow you all to do your
            jobs for Alaskans. Thank you.
