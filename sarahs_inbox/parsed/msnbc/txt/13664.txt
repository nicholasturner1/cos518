            He, again, sort of knows how to blow it, eh? Again telling the press I did not ever give a
            target number, thus intimating it's the Gov's office fault the budget grew outrageously,
            "communication breakdowns", etc.



            Weak. Amazing how much faith is/was put into Meyer through all this, yet he isn't the type
            to want to be held accountable, just as we found out last year. Surely he knows his budget
            isn't going to stay un-touched? Pis make sure you "communicate" that to him.
