       I
              MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,

                Please begin to consider the possibility of being the

             vice - presidential candidate for our party .          I think you

             would really add a lot to the ticket for whoever gets

             the presidential nod for our party.           If a buzz develops;

             please don't reject the idea too quickly.             Please think

             about it.     Thank you.

                                                      Tom Duncan
