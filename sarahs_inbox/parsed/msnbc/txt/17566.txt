             Governor,
             I just spoke with Senator Halford . He is more than willing to help you , without compensation
             (although I think we should pick up his expenses ), and is available here in Anchorage to meet
             with you at your convenience . Is there a time that works for you over the next few days? Once
             I get your feedback I will call Rick back and firm up a time and place. He also offered to meet at
             his house, which he describes as halfway between your home in the Valley and Anchorage, as
             well as meeting here in Anchorage or in the Valley. Rick did indicate that he would want
             extensive briefings on the legislation in order to be up to speed and I told him we would be more
             than willing to provide such briefings.
             Marty

                     Meghan,

                     I am available when you pick a time .            I strongly agree with Pat Galvin

                     that " Dr" Antony Scott needs to be in on the meeting .             I am currently in

                     Anchorage and must be here for my daughters 15th birthday on Saturday.

                     Thus ,    I could be available for a Friday or Monday AM meeting in

                     Anchorage if that works out.

                     Marty
