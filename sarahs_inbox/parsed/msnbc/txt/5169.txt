                 Holy Moly...
                 I had no idea this one would be so sensitive... did anyone else get any sense that this appointment
                 was not going over well? I've also heard that Lisa M. and other high ranking officials are baffled
                 by my action on this one,

                   Dear Sarah:

                   You would never have done what you did if you did know Joe Ralston.

                   I will not compare Joe to John Binkley; they are both fine men.

                  What concerns me is the "counsel you did not get" when you made your
                  decision. The advice you must have received on Joe was just awful.

                  I do not believe certain individuals are sophisticated or experienced
                  enough to understand Joe's sacrifice and service for Alaska and our
                  Nation.

                  Senator Ted Stevens, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Congressman Don Young
                  and Senator/Governor Frank Murkowski together do not compare to Joe.

                  But, Joe Ralston is not a politician like Ted, Lisa, Don, Frank and
                  John Binkley. If your decision was "political" your counsel is
                  "inexperienced."

                  I am concerned for your future, for you being the best, for you
                  getting sound advice and counsel ... as you know, Frank did not
                  listen and he failed.

                  I want you to have great success!! Alaska and our Nation needs you
                  as an individual of character and "we Alaskans" need your leadership.

                  You are Alaska's future and to a great extent the best America has in
                  public service. You and Joe Ralston are very rare individuals; the
                  best! !

                  Excuses on "attempts" to contact Joe on the weekend when he may be on
                  an international mission for President George W . Bush are unacceptable.

                  But, I suppose a call to the White House switchboard , the State
                  Department switchboard or the Pentagon switchboard may have been
                  successful.

                  Sarah, do not tolerate incompetence!! or Anyone who makes excuses for
                  totally unacceptable background research!!

                  This is an example of experienced counsel to Alaska's Governor is so
                  important. Do not allow the " inexperienced " to make your decisions.

                  I appreciate your "thank you " on ethics . I will always do everything
                  I can to see you succeed.

                  That is why I am so concerned about this situation. You always
                  deserve the best counsel and this situation is unconscionable.

                  Very Respectfully, My Best Wishes and Prayers,

                  Wev
