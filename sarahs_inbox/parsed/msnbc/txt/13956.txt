            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

               Just a quick note to thank you for being all that you are and even more than you
            promised to be back at election time! You have restored a sweet, gentle spirit of
            integrity to our State Government and have worked tirelessly to keep your "up beat"
            message of leadership flowing through our State.

               Quite frankly, I don't have a clue where you find the energy, but keep up the good
            work!!  As a business person in Soldotna, I am delighted by the decisions you have made
            and I just want to send a note to let you know you are appreciated!!

               I read in the ADN that you are "sharpening your axe" to deal with budget issues --
            Thank You For Being There!! You have made excellent decisions and I know you will
            continue to do so! Hang In There and Thank You!!
