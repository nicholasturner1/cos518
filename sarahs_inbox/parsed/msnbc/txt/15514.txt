            Do we have AGIA pts for this morning's national interviews? I'll need copies of the AGIA
            press releases and/or anything else - any bullets from AGIA folks? All I have is the ex
            summary from last week's announcement. Wall St Journal calls in nine minutes.

            Not sure where this fax came from on my desk (from Begich office - looks like it was sent
            friday) but ramseur's suggestion that I speak to mark over the weekend of his energy ideas
            wasn't received until this morning. Pls have steve get a copy of this and he can get ahold
            of begich's folks on some of these ideas until a mtg can be set up. Also pls let their
            office know I did not received the fax and suggestion until today.
