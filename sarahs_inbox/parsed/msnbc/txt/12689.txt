            Governor-




            An independent film company is filming a documentary on the ice sculptures. They would
            like to ask you a couple of questions and have you fake the announcement of the winner -
            15 minute commitment.  I told them that your time in Fairbanks is limited but I would ask.
            I have no problem telling them no.
