              Governor,

              Attached is a letter from President Green requesting the abortion bills be added to the call . It appears similar to
              the conversation you had with the Senator earlier this month.

              Talk to you later.

              Kelly

              Kelly,



              Please deliver this letter to Governor Palin. It is from President Green and is about the two abortion bills.




              Thanks,
