                 Governor Palin,

                 I'm so happy you sent me this e-mail.

                 I'm going to forward this to all of my friends and family in the lower 48 states. I know everyone
                 wants to know what you are doing for the'budget' in Alaska. There are lots of questions about
                 your budget and WHO is going to benefit from it.

                 I'd like to know how much of the savings is going to the Governor Palin Foundation.

                 Thank you Sarah Palin!

                 Merry Christmas,

                 Charlie Kohm

                 Mr. Evans,

                 Therapeutic Foster Care is included in my foster son's current treatment plan. It is also the one therapy in
                 his care plan that has been consistently stable and successful . Yvonne Chase has never been listed as a
                 member of my foster son's treatment team, and as such, does not get to suddenly exclude successful
                 therapies to suit her fancy . Treatment plan decisions are made by the guardian (s), in a treatment team
                 format Medicaid pays the bills- NOT DENALI FAMILY SERVICES. My foster son continues to receive
                 therapeutic foster care therapy in my therapeutic foster home, and I expect to be reimbursed for services
                 rendered.

                 Who shall I bill as of 12/13/07?


                 Ron Cowan, Disability Law Center of AK:

                 Since this clearly is an effort to cause financial strain in this foster home, and thereby disrupt my foster
                 son's placement, would you mind running this by your lawyers to advise us of our rights?


                 Mr. Kitchen and Ms. Starry:

                 Help. Please.
