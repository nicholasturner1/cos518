           Sure.



           I apologize for missing some of your a-mails or phone calls this last week. The Chairman
           make everyone turn off their cell phones and blackberries, and on some days, I was in
           hearings for several hours or nearly the whole day.

             From a bit more research , it looks like the name of the state police was finally changed
             from "Alaska State Police" to "Alaska State Troopers" in 1967.
