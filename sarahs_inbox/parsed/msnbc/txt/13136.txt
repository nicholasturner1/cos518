           Governor - Flowers will be delivered today as you had requested to Rep. Nelson and family
           from the Office of the Governor.




           We have heard back from Secretary Gutierrez office and the Secretary has very limited
           hours in Alaska and is only stopping in Fairbanks at this time to meet with Senator
           Stevens.  The Secretary is aware of the offer from the Governor to meet and will try for a
           quick visit the next time up. Janice
