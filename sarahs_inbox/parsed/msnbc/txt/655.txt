   Just got an invite to the Meyer for State SENATE Campaign Kick-Off Fundraiser on
   Wed Oct 3

   Lets see      That's Cowdery's district      oh, and the other Rep in the District is Samuel's

   Sounds like the die is cast and things are in motion for Kevin to move up to the Senate


   Event sponsor's have a couple Alliance people's names
