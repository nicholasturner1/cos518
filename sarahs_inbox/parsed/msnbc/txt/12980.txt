           Yesterday, after reviewing the letter to the editor, I requested details from Mark on his
           conversations with Larry as I was not at all aware that Larry had ongoing concerns. I had
           a follow-up conversation with both Mark and Colleen this morning regarding similar
           concerns you mentioned below. I am following up on this end and will talk with
           Commissioner Campbell.

           What is he talking about in his letter to editor in Frontiersman - and if this is the
           comment that Mark Kelsey suggested was coming publicly last week it is a shame it wasnt
           addressed before his letter was published. Pls find out what you can - I have no idea what
           he's talking about. Pls work with DMVA to deal with it and just let me know the solution
           and conclusion. Thanks. Please ask colleen and mark what happened on this valley
           constituent issue, too.
