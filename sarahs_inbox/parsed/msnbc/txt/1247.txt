  Todd - A woman by the name of Lorna called and said she had just stopped by the ANC office to see the
  Governor and was told that she was in a meeting. I confirmed this on the phone. She wanted to speak
  with her personally and said that she knows the Governor and you very, very well. She can be reached
  at:       Po - A&ted                 (cell). Thanks, Janice
