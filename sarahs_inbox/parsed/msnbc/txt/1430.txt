  First Gent Todd-
  I have your biography draft webpage done and ready for your review. I'll be working on the Mansion
  Foundation page next so that it can be done well in advance of your coming fundraiser/event for the
  Gov's House.

  On your bio page , I added links at the bottom to items that I thought you've expressed passion about. If
  you have different or additional ideas let me know and I'll get them on there so we can make this page
  available to the public.

  Please review this webpage and let us know if this meets your approval:

  As an additional note... I believe Janice will get a hold of you about scheduling a photo shoot here in
  Juneau for your "official" photo. The one I put on your draft biography (link above) page is from that
  family shoot in late 2007 and will work until we are able to take a better photo of you in the future.

  Thank you!
