  Alliance Juneau Update




  4.13.07




  ExxonMobil told House Resources that despite some legislative improvements to House Bill 177 (the Alaska Gasline
  Inducement Act, or "AGIA"), the bill overall still doesn't provide sufficient flexibility for prospective license applicants to
  put forward meaningful proposals . Rather than prescribing specific requirements , the state should lay out general goals in the
  bill and allow applicants flexibility in addressing them.




  Martin Massey, company spokesman, praised changes that tighten criteria for selection of a licensee, allow producers to
  oppose rolled-in tariffs on pipeline expansions and make the $500 million state grant a bid option rather than a requirement.



                                                                                                          ROSTON 00156

  Senate Judiciary , meanwhile, focused on issues of judicial review and appeal rights of unsuccessful applicants for the gas
  pipeline license envisioned by AGIA. Appeals could delay final award of a license. The Senate's version of AGIA is SB 104.




  Under terms of the current Senate version of the bill, the legislature must pass a resolution approving the administration's
  award of a license.




  Committee members offered differing views. Sen. Bill Wielechowski said consideration of a bill, rather than a resolution,
  would reduce appeal options for an unsuccessful licensee, Sen. Lesil McGuire endorsed use of a resolution. Sen. Gene
  Therriault said the Legislature should set out requirements in the bill and leave licensing to the administration as part of its
  normal executive branch duties.




   At a Judiciary hearing Thursday on SB 104, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance testified that upstream fiscal issues need to
   be resolved before North Slope producers will make commitments for space in a gas pipeline. "The Alaska Gasline
  .Inducement Act puts too much emphasis on mitigating the short-term financial risks incurred by pipeline builders and does
  too little to address the much longer-term risks of gas shippers," the Alliance said. "For the sake of Alaska's future, the
   Alliance urges you not only to determine what terms aren't constitutional, but also to find a mutually beneficial solution that
   is."
