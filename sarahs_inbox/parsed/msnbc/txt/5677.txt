         Governor,




         We are making the changes to the travel report as we discussed. The only

         outstanding item that I am aware of is that we can delete the per diem for

         the kids on the report if you would like to return the checks. They are

         however, entitled to the meal allowance for trips associated with state.

         business.     Your call.     Thanks.




         Mike
