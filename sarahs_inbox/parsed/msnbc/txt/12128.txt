              MESSAGE:

              Dear Gov. Palin,

              I'm a longtime McCain supporter, and that lone aewish Republican in Boston, only rumored
              to exist.

              I just called the McCain campaign to recommend he consider you as his running mate,
              especially if Sen. Obama is the nominee.

              As a former media producer for political campaigns and a political junkie, I think it
              makes sense on more levels than I can fit in this box.

              God bless my nephew in the Marine Corp and your son in the United States Army.

              All the best

              Mark Cohen
