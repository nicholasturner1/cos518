I'll look at the video footage, we should be able to see who that was. I'm sure Tom will also. So sorry
to hear that you had to put up with that!

Yes, I've tried many different ways to access it through the icon, through the tv station that used to
show it . Also, can Tom or someone look back on security tapes from last night (starting at 1:35am)
and Sunday evening to see who kept ringing the door bell?

Yes, they all should be working. To view them you should be able to access them through the icon
on your computer (Pelco). I will follow up as soon as I get to work.

Tom- did the Security alarm ever get re-set after you explained to Todd last week that something
was wrong with it? And the security camera doesn't show on the tv or home computers anymore. I
ask because it's 1:40am and someone's ringing the doorbell again and I can't see who it is without
going down there (same thing happened Sunday). All is fine, but haven't heard if something
happened with security camera outdoors.
