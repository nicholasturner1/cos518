           Keller asked to resign

           WASILLA -- The Wasilla City Council voted late Monday night to approve a resolution asking
           Mayor Dianne M. Keller to resign.




           The decision came after hours of testimony from the public, Keller and other city
           officials involved in a damaging report from an independent law firm accusing some in the
           city of acting inappropriately in dealings with a private developer.



           The resolution passed 4-1, with Deputy Mayor Kristofer D. Larson in opposition. Councilman
           Doug Holler was not present at the meeting.
