           No, thank YOU for being dogged about this and getting McAllister to understand this. Yes,
           I'd be happy to be interviewed by him. Too often the leggies who choose to play this "he-
           said/she-said" game get away with telling untruths... and we're left looking
           "uncommunicative". Lyda's done it numerous times to us, as have others. McAllister's
           interest in this allows us to clear this one up, and more importantly illustrates for him
           what we're up against in this strange political world we're trying to work in. Thank you

           Subject:    Speaker Harris / Channel 2




           Governor-




           I spoke with Bill McAllister a few minutes ago and he agreed to do a follow up story on
           the Speaker's accusation that he didn't know about the meeting. Russ called Senator
           Therriault and Representative Coghill and they will both confirm on the record that they
           spoke to Speaker Harris about the meeting. Since we are basically calling Harris out on
           his lie, Bill wants the opportunity to interview Harris on the issue. I hope I didn't
           overstep - but I promised Bill and interview with you tomorrow. Russ said he would be
           happy to take part and talk about the timeline/paper trail. Thank you.
