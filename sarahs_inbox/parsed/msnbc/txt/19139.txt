       Initial results from the State Public Health Lab were that the power was sporeless,
       indicating that it is very unlikely to be a biological threat.

                       Importance: High



                       Update of situation:




                       Korean national was very sick but had GI tract problems and is NOT a further
        threat.



                       No results from crime lab yet.



                       SECC in close contact with MOA EOC, DHSS, AST.



                       SECC informing Interagency partners



                    If it is a presumptive positive we plan to man the SECC 24/7. If it is a
        presumptive negative we plan to man the SECC with larger response cell until we get
        confirmed negative.



                    If the powder turns out to be bio threat of a large magnitude (as opposed to
        pesticide) I would expect MOA to be able to handle the prophylactic drug distribution for
        the personnel potentially contaminated.



                    The larger long- term issue with an anthrax-type substance will be the clean up
        of the Brady Building. Would potentially expect MOA disaster declaration and would
        suggest an immediate DPC for probable State disaster declaration and request for Federal
        assistance.



                       Or it could all be a hoax and we could enjoy a lovely weekend.
