             Can you eliminate the verbiage from the verse on backside so I can write on that side.
             It's beautiful!

             Working with Kris and Kate we've got this down to a final draft for review.

             Thanks everyone!

             Andy,



             The Governor loved Trig's announcement and the design. Some minor verbiage
             changes/additions:
                                                                     1




                                                                                                                  PRA_GSPO1_0015901

             Under his picture, add appropriate language from verse , citing Proverbs 3:5-6.



             On the inside , replace Sandburg quote with: The night breeze hums a lullaby - sweet baby,
             you're the reason why.



             Weight should be changed to 6.3lbs and add 18 inches on the length.



             Thanks! Great work.



             Kris

             Attached is the draft announcement ( JPEGS also attached if the PDF doesn't open ).             There's
             a blank line inside the card for Trig ' s length ( if that's something you'd like).



             This was designed to be a card of quarter page in size        ( 4.25 by 5 . 5 when folded ) and would
             look great on a shiny - ish card stock paper.



             Let me know if there is anything we can change.

              -Andy ( and team)

             That photo is so precious. . .and would work great for a birth announcement.

             If you have thoughts about text for a printed announcement .. . we'd be happy to put
             something together!

             Wow! That's a beautiful picture!!! I'm going to ask Jason/Andy if this one would work for
             a birth announcement.
