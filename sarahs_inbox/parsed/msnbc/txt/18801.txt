         I need the speech as soon as possible this morning, hopefully in near-final form. I want
         AGIA communications folks to edit it and to make sure our message is consistent,
         energetic, and meshes with the iogcc participants' agenda. Thanks



         If it's not complete, pls send it to me anyway be I want to hustle on this
