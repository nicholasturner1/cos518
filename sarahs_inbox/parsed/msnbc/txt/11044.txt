              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.

                   EMPIRE CENTER ON SPITZER 'S STATE OF THE STATE


                       On Wednesday, January 9, 2008, Governor Eliot Spitzer delivered his State of the State
                       Address . He proposed a cap on state school tax. Please visit the Empire Center for New YorF
                       State Policy website for timely analysis of this proposal and other policies.


                       OP-ED:

                       E.J. McMahon , New York Post, January 10, 2008
                       Gov. Spitzer' s second an nual State of the State message yesterday featured what may ultimately
                       stand out as his Nixon-goes-to-China moment. Annoying a powerful ally - and embracing a concept he
                       had rejected during the 2006 gubernatorial campaign - Spitzer said he would form a special
                       commission to recommend a "fair and effective cap" on school taxes in New York...
