            thanks JB - these folks are something else.
            there's a lot of selfishness in the fisheries issues, I find. It's tempting to just fine good, objective,
            fair Alaskans willing to serve on these boards even if they have NO fish experience - to show the
            obsessed factions that we're not going to kowtow to any particular faction.

              I also had numerous conversations with Kenai Peninsula legislators and also with Doug

              What a situation... holy cow. I have more of an appreciation of the crap you've been going
              through... bless you.

              I will submit you a report tomorrow on my efforts and thoughts.

              Bruce Knowles from Mat_Su Fish Advisory insists Yetna, Fish Creek escapements are
              being ignored by F & G.

              He wants this addressed. He insists F & G is "all Comm fish". They're very concerned.

             He's threatening, or promising: "Emergency petition for escapement goals will be
             submitted for the April 16 meeting (B of F), in the next couple of days."

             This is also coming from Wayne Ross, evidently. (Per Mr. Knowles.)

             Just got off the phone with him. He's ticked.

             FYI - phone call I made to him was a courtesy to Wayne Ross - and the phone call didn't
             go very well.




             Don't pick lemons.
