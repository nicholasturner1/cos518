        Palin addresses farmers protesting dairy closing

        WASILLA - Gov. Sarah Palin told a crowd of farmers and concerned Valley residents today
        that she plans to fix the broken state-run Matanuska Maid dairy.

        "Things are kind of a mess right now with what's happening with Mat Maid, and we're going
        to clean it up," Palin said. "we can revitalize it, and.that's what our commitment is."

        Palin addressed approximately 100 people gathered at 10 a.m. at a farm near the Trunk and
        Bogard roads intersection.

        Bob Havemeister, a lifelong Valley farmer in whose driveway the group assembled, said the
        dairy buys the bulk of his milk. If it closes as planned July 7, he'll have to send his
        cows to slaughter. Asked what will happen to his dairy farm, he said, "It might turn into
        a subdivision. what else would I do?"

        Dairy officials said previously that should the dairy remain open, it would lose $2
        million by the end of the year. Since 2005, it has lost $1.3 million, including $700,000
        this year, according to statistics cited previously by state creamery board chairman Mac
        Carter.

        The board, citing mounting debts, on Wednesday rejected Palin's call to reconsider its
        close date.
