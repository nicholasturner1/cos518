           Governor:



          Thanks.  I checked with Roger at DOTPF and the release has not been sent out yet. We'll
          make that change.



          Jim, Captain Falvey, and I will be meeting this week to talk about getting the winter
          schedule out in July, about 6 weeks early.



          Randy
