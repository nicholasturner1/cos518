         Hello Governor,

         I'm sure you can relate- that when everyone's asleep at home- you can actually concentrate
         on what you're doing, so that was part of the reason for the late night.



         The contractor hasn't been by today, but I'll let you know what he has to say when I do
         see him.  That's horrible that Willow received a threat from someone in Juneau! I will
         certainly be covering your family in prayer and that God would give you and Todd wisdom in
         the decisions concerning your family.



         " A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps and makes them
         sure"
               Proverbs 16:9

         I pray for God's wisdom as you ask for His guidance and direction regarding what's best
         for you and your family this coming year.   I pray that God will fill you with a
         confidence in those decisions as you obey Him and that He will strengthen you to walk
         firmly and boldly into the plans He has for you, the State and your family. That the
         darts that would try to steal precious time and energy would fall to the side as you plow
         through the different areas and issues that need plowing and that he'd continue to give
         you His peace & strength.

         Just wanted to add that-   I won't be the obnoxious lady sending you the Jesus emails and
         quoting scripture left & right and meddling in your business. You're the Governor, I'm
         the House Manager- not your Pastor/Spiritual Advisor, etc...  This is and will be a very
         rare exception that I'll go on like this. Promise! :)

        At the staff meeting today I stressed once again the importance of us maintaining a high
        level of confidentiality.  The staff could clearly see the lack of judgment in sending out
        the email with information regarding your family.          agrees wholeheartedly that it
        was a bad decision, and has stated once again that there was no malicious intent on her
                                                                    1

         part.  I did stress that this was very serious and unnecessarily robbed valuable time from
         taking care of important
          My take is that I'm getting the House ready for the start of the school year, regardless
         of rumors or if you and Todd decide to enroll the kids in Wasilla--the House will be
         ready!  We're doing our best to keep this window restoration project on schedule, so as
         far as the contractor knows I want it ready for the school year. No ones business who's
         in the House- that's the time frame we've set for the project.

         Please let me know if there is anything that you need!

         Thank you,

         Erika

         Thank you Erika and don't lose any more sleep over this - so strange that rumors fly the
         way they do. I'm torn between wanting to correct the reporter's and Privil's comments or
         just deciding it should not be anyone' s business where my kids go to sc ool so I won't
         comment at all about the issue.



         Please ask that contractor where he heard the girls were enrolled in Wasilla? Piper and
         Willow are not, but the reaction to the rumors that "we're not coming back" ( as was
         evidently written in f?^ s email that the reporter wrote about) is so unsettling that -
         especially for Todd- that it's tempting to protect these kids from the ugly aspect of the
         spotlight and just let them try to live a more normal life that they're used to in their
         hometown.

         Between the events surrounding reaction to a sensible move to cut back Stef's hours and a
         recent very, very ugly threat Willow received from a Juneau girl - it's not been a good
         couple of days on the family front.




        Prlvile was wrong to send an email claiming we're not coming back - not only was it incorrect
         but it obviously violated privacy issues relating to my family. Very disappointing, but
         what' s done is done and the episode will give Todd and me an opportunity to consider what
         would be best for our kids next year - considering the reaction resulting from this
         episode.




         Thanks Erika. And I know you understand the time constraints I've been under with the
         state budget items being vetoed and finalized in just a few hours from now - in addition
         to many others issues on the administration's plate.

        Hello Governor,



        I apologize that a member of the House staff gave out any

        Today a contractor told me that he'd heard that the Palin family might not be returning
        and that the kids had been enrolled in the Wasilla school district & not Jnu. AND then
        proceeded to ask me if this was true.

        I called the House staff tonight and used the contractor question from tonight and
        Privile e 's email incident to spring board into a conversation on the urgency and importance
        of ma ing sure that all information that we are privy to is strictly confidential.
        Confidentiality has always been stressed with the staff at the Governor's House but with
        everything happening I told them that I felt that a phone call from me was necessary to
        enforce our long standing policies- especially in light of the recent events with the
        email and the article.

        When I talked to Diane, she mentioned that she was sent an email. She read it to me- and
        it mentioned that the Palin family would not be returning until the fall. I'm not sure
        if I would've even been aware of the reporter/interview/email situation if I hadn't
         approached wafter her phone call with Mike and asked her what was happening- even
        then it took a phone call and more questions to kind of put it together and a phone call
        to Diane (after you & I talked).




                                                                                                 PRA GSP01 _0002862

         As for the House schedule - it is common knowledge with the contractor/workers that the
         your family will not be in Juneau the month of July due to the window project and that

         I wanted to let you know that 1. ) I talked to the staff tonight and a strong point
         was made coming from me w. no reflection on anything/anyone else and 2 .) I'm sorry for my
         part - in not doing a better job - in protecting your privacy and that of your family. I
         never would ' ve expected the House to be a source of negative press. Ugh!
