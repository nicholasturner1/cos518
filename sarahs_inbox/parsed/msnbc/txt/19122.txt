          Dear Sarah,rnI have already found Mr. Millers address and wrote him a strong letter about
          minding his own business, and said how would you like it if one of our lawmakers sponsored
          a bill that was somewhat specific to California how would he like it. rnI wanted to, but I
          didn't swear.rnJim SouzarnrnP.S. We have met before
