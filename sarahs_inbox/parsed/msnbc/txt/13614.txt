            I believe the request probably came from the ANSCA CEO's but I am not certain .                     They were
            very interested in it and felt they had several legis who would help them.



            When we met with them in Juneau the Governor and all of us explained that it was not legal
            for us to take sides on an initiative.  we have been consistent with this message.



            We also explained that if the legislature appropriated a small amount of money with
            language specific to an initiative then the Governor , I, or our people could educate and
            explain initiatives and their problems without risk of being accused of taking sides.
            Further it would be legal for us to take sides if we chose .  The CEO's are very worried
            that if the initiatives pass then all large mining would stop and then even oil and gas
            would be impacted.



            We told the CEO's that we would not ask for the money.  But if it was made available we
            could educate and explain the initiatives without any legal issue for us.

            Pretty sure this was testified as requested by the Administration in (H) Fin. The $25K
            approp was brought forward by Meyer's aide on behalf of the Admin. Both Gara and Crawford
            opposed it but it passed anyway.

           Pla make sure it's publicized that the Gov's Office did NOT request the $ for pebble
           "influence" initiative (see today's ADN). In fact, Tom and I have repeatedly said publicly
           we will NOT in any way attempt to sway any ballot initiative and certainly have no
           intention on spending public dollars to influence this issue that at some point will be in
           front of voters.
