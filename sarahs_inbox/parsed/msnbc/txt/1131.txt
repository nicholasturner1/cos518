Congratulations on the birth of your 5th child! Hope all goes well for the family. My husband and I,
both 72, drove, with an RV, to Alaska in 2007, and we are still in awe of the beauty we found in your
state. Awesome! We hope to make the trip again someday.



We lost our only child in 2004 to breast cancer, at the age of 47, so... .cherish your children! Truly a
gift from God.



Best Wishes,



Libby and Sonny Scott
