              Based on Frank ' s convo , we'll talk about it this morning w / Sharon and come up w / a plan. I
              would suspect that there will be calls for comment regarding her erroneous claim.

              How can we check her on it now - depending on what Frank /Ivy find? Someone call reporters?
              Me put out a personal statement on it?

             Will do. Also in response to the emails about Lyda, I too think she should be called out
             on this. Her dishonesty shouldn't go unchecked... it'll be interesting what Frank
             discovers.

              May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to
              address it before I leave for Juneau. Update on clean water initiatives/Gillam's efforts
              too?

              I agree.  We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I think
              it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change. Tom

              I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - well meet with mike (and whomever else in the
              room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
              streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
              understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
