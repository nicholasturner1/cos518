         J-may i get updated iogcc agenda so i'll know where i am needed at that mtg. Security
         keeps asking my travel plans for new orleans , i keep telling them i don't know until iogcc
         tells us where/ when I'm expected to be there. Once we know, and if I'm speaking there,
         we'll need oil and gas team to prepare message we need incorporated into their agenda.
         (Dan seamount could help, too?)



         And do i take over as chairman at that mtg next month?
