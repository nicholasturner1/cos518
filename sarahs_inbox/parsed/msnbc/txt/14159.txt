                Governor:
                All that's left are a few minor tweaks.
                5%,3%,3%
                3% for achieving an Intermediate Certificate from the Police Standards Council
                3.75% for achieving an Advanced Certificate (these do not compound, and a trooper
                can go straight for an Advanced without getting an Intermediate). If a trooper already
                gets premium pay, he/she makes the choice to receive that premium pay OR the
                certificate amount.
                Service Steps - as offered to SU,
                Article 7 Discipline Language re: egregious behavior including dishonesty
                Indemnification Language that Risk Management & Law worked on

                We believe the PSEA membership will support the agreement and will post a media
                announcement tomorrow when the deal is finalized. We'll be sending monetary terms
                to the Legislature by tomorrow. Karen Rehfeld has been notified.

                We will not reach agreement with two of the three maritime unions: MEBA and
                MM&P prior to the end of the legislative session. AVTECTA (Seward Vo-Tech Center)
                has not yet ratified its contract, nor has Inland Boatmens' Union (IBU).
