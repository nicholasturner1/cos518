         Heard from larry and katz - they reiterate that they didnt tell D.C. until minutes
         afterwards - but still haven't heard from you or anyone else whom I thought had notified
         delegation staff.  ?

         Wow- i must have missed the fairbanks editorial that ran today in Juneau. Mike- if, as
         i've been told, the delgation and staff WAS informed of bridge cancellation, yet editorial
         claims otherwise to mislead the public, then please send a correction today to both
         newspapers. Had anyone caught that previously? Pls send the clairification asap. Thanks
