          MESSAGE:

          Hello,



          We want to congratulate you on the birth of your boy! What               a blessing he is and will le
          to you and your family. Our daughter with DS is 7 now and               we couldn't love her more. We
          have learned that DS does not define her- she is just the               greatest gift. She has taught
          us what is important. Blessings to you all, Wayne and Chris             Dillinger
