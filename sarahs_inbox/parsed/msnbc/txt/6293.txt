          Got asked again today by McAllister because I used the term              " probable sp

          session this fall" when discussing Vic Kohring ' s replacement. Bill

          zipped right past the big announcement of Wes Keller and focused in on

          sp session again . Y'know ,      I think the tremdendous interest in this, esp

          by reporters ,   has to do with logistics - they want to know where they

          should plan on camping this fall - Juneau or road system ? October or

          later?



          Bradner got his other front-page story wrong, too, on our operating

          budget. I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed the day he filed

          those stories.

          Governor,



          I apologize for the confusion .        The articles were written by Tim Bradner

          who took my statement that we had not found a fundamental flaw with PPT

          (something different than what was expected), and spun it.as a tacit

          endorsement.     Tim has a viewpoint that comes through in his reporting.

          Throughout our interview, I never implied that PPT was good; in fact, I

          told him that I thought we could do better to target the credits toward

          the riskier exploration side ,       not give them across the board as PPT

          does.   Tim chose to downplay those statements.



          Until we complete our review, make a recommendation to you, and you

          announce your intentions regarding a special session, I 'm trying to keep

          the press message as a fair assessment of the options.



          I'm also looking forward to our next meeting on PPT. I expect it will

          be early next week. I still believe we will come up with a better

          option on the gross , but the politics are explosive ,         so we need to have

          all our ducks in a row before we launch anything. Tibbles and Joe will

          have thoughts on that issue.



          Again, I'm sorry the article created confusion.           I agree with you that

          the sooner we come together on our plan ,       and get a positive message out,

          the better.



          - Pat
                                                              5

         Pat- we'll hopefully be meeting on ppt soon. The articles in yesterday's

         ADN and J of C sounded like a one-eighty departure from the consistent

         message re : ppt NOT being       " sound ".   I was asked to respond yesterday by a

         few reporters in Juneau, and also by legislators who may now think we're

         confused ... as they still expect the sp session call this fall and were

         surprised to read your comments . My response was that I haven ' t changed

         my mind about the need to revisit ppt this fall.
