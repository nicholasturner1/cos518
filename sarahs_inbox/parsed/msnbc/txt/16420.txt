           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin, I'm a retired guy, that's very concerned with the up coming election.
           First it's time for a woman to be elected to be president. It is important that she be a
           Republican, and smart. If John McCain ask you to join him on our ticket, please take it.
           Regards Ed Mooney
