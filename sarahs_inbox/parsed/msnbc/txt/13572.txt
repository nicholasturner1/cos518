             There will be many things we have not been privy to re: budget items hidden within - just
             like this PR effort that is so costly and not supported. We have to scour this thing and
             I will be cutting items that are not in the state's best interest, and I will need a lot
             of help to accomplish this. I'm not sure what good it will do to ask Lyda what her
             intention is on this one, she probably doesn't know. And if this is another PacWest-type
             PR campaign, all the more reason to eliminate it.



             Same applies to additional Arctic Power funds.



             Amazing that someone tipped off the ADN reporter to a $10-12 thousand dollar AGIA "PR
             contract" and that made front page news , yet something like this, costing that amount, is
             thus far hidden within a proposed budget with no public comment?

            OK - we found it! Buried in Section 62(b) of SB221, page 206, line 18 - it is a
            reappropriation of legislative appropriations - reads as follows:

            (b)   The unexpended and,unobligated balances, not to exceed $2,000,000,. of the
            appropriations made in sec. 1, ch. 28, SLA 2007, page 42, line 22 (Budget and Audit
            Committee - $14,219,300); sec. 1, ch. 28 SLA 2007, page 42, line 28 (Legislative Council -
            $30,201,500); and sec. 1, ch. 28, SLA 2007, page 43, line 6 (Legislative Operating Budget
            - $9,682,300) are reappropriated to the Legislative Council for the Alaska Conference on
            State and Federal Responsibility Related to Economic Impacts of ESA Listings for the
            fiscal years ending June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2010.

            Perhaps we can find out more from Rep. Harris and Senator Green what they have in mind -

             I read in this morning ' s Fairbanks News-Miner that the Legislature wants to appropriate
            $2 million to itself for a national conference and public relations campaign to educate
            Americans about the impacts of a polar bear listing under the Endangered Species Act.
