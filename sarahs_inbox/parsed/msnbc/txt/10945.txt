                Good morning Mr. Boyd.

                I'm sorry but the statute cite you referenced only applies toward regulations. For a public meeting, in this
                case, a workshop, AS 44.62.310(e) applies. This cite requires the State to give reasonable notice. The
                notice of this workshop was published in the Anchorage Daily News and posted in and around Willow
                community. I've been asked to give more notice in the future and based upon that request, have agreed
                to give at least 15 days advance notice for subsequent meetings.

                I hope you can attend tonight.

                Ron Stroman

                Mr Stroman, I have not received DOT's notification of this meeting and neither has
                anyone else I talked to. AS 44.62. 190 requires 30 days notice for these type meetings, but I
                guess that doesn 't apply to DOT.
