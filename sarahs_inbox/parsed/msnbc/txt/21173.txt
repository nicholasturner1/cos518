             J- pis ask someone to jot a few things down for me then. I didnt know this was a speaking gig... with Mayor Begich.
             Maybe Ana could find a few minutes to do so?

             I'll ask Sean P if he knows him also.

             Also, i don't need two seats- I'll just hustle in there if my flt returns from Fairbanks on time, I won't be traveling with
             anyone, so don't want a seat to look conspicuously empty
