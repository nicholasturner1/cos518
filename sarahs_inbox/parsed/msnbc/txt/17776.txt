        Mike and john: remember halford asked that you guys call him for strategy. It can not hurt
        to do so - pls take him up on offer and ask him today his advice. He's been there, seen
        it, knows lyda, etc.

        I completely agree.  Tibbles, Marty and I discussed this at dinner, and Marty and I
        expressed these concerns.



        After Huggins and Joule leave for the weekend tomorrow, the group will not have their
        first meeting until Monday.            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
