            They could always stand there and chime in at the end if appropriate, but not be
            headliners at the start.

            I received a message from Mayor Williams' office letting me know that the mayor and his
            chief of staff Tim Navarre will be attending the press conference in person.

              Subject: Final information re: Cook Inlet LNG Agreement' Press Conference



             Governor, All,



             Attached are the "final" documents for use at tomorrows Cook Inlet LNG Agreement' Press
            Conference:




             1)  Governor's suggested "Opening Statement."           Note that I've also included information
            on the Opening Statements from:



                            a. Jim Bowles ,    President , ConocoPhillips, Alaska;



                            b. Steve Hinchman, Senior Vice President Worldwide Production, Marathon Oil
            company;



                            c. Gene Dubay, Senior Vice President of Operations,           Semco   (parent company of
            Enstar).



             Please note that these gentlemen have crafted their statements assuming the Governor will
            begin the Press Conference with her Opening Statement going FIRST.




             2)   Cook Inlet LNG Agreement "Executive Summary" - a one-page overview of the Agreement.




             3)  Cook Inlet LNG Agreement "Questions & Answers" - divided into those questions
            expected to be posed to the state and those questions expected to be posed to the two
            companies.




             4)   Line-up of Press Conference attendees from CP, M0, Enstar & the state. On this

                                                                 2




                                                                                                           PRA GSPO1_0009293

            document I've identified titles and noted those individuals who served on the Agreement'
            negotiating team.




             Additional pertinent information:



             *         The expectation is the event will unfold as follows:



                       *         Opening Statement from Governor Palin , followed by;

                       *         Opening Statements from:



                                 *        Jim Bowles , ConocoPhillips , Alaska

                                 *        Steve Hinchman , Marathon Oil Company

                                 *        Gene Dubay , Enstar



                              *       Then it will be turned - over to Questions & Answers.  I am told
            that Jim Bowles ( CP) & Steve Hinchman ( MO) will attempt to personally handle all questions
            that are pertinent for the two companies to answer .    Only if they feel they cannot
            properly address the questions will they turn the question over to their supporting staff.




             *       I will have 50 copies of the Agreement & the Agreement ' Executive Summary
            available for hand - out at the press conference . Additionally , by 12 : 15pm we will have
            both of these documents posted on the following website , which we can refer people to if
            they are not physically at the Press Conference:



                       *        www.dog . dnr.state . ak.us/oil/




             *       We will NOT make the " Questions & Answers " document available to the public, as
            this was developed for internal use only.




                       The Cook Inlet LNG Agreement has been filed with the Dept of Energy              ( DOE) under a
                                                                3




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01 _0009294

            supplement Pleading . The State " filed " ( mailed ) this document on January 2nd. DOE should
            receive this filing by January 4th , at the latest . The State and the two companies will
            also be calling DOE to notify them it is enroute tomorrow .      The document filed with the
            DOE is referred to as the "State ' s Supplemental Comments and Settlement Agreement."




             *       I have provided this information to John Katz and asked him to give our
            Congressional Delegation a heads - up that we have reached this agreement , and have
            simultaneously filed this Pleading with the Dept of Energy ( DOE), before our
            teleconference tomorrow . I am told that the companies intend to provide this same update
            to our Congressional Delegation tomorrow morning.




             *         I have asked the Press Conference attendees to meet in the Governor ' s Anchorage
            Office at 11:45am .   Several of the company representatives have not met the Governor and
            would like the opportunity to meet her before the Press Conference .    Plus , the group
            includes multiple " CEO types ."  Therefore it might be useful to move the group into the
            Governor ' s office just before the press conference in order for her to meet everyone and
            then we could all proceed into the conference room through the Governor ' s entrance.    And,
            I do apologize that there will be such a MOB , but they all wanted to attend!




             *       Please note that Attorney General Talis Colberg , and AAG Steve DeVries will also
            attend the press conference . Neither Attorney General Colberg nor Steve DeVries were
            identified on my previous list.




             *        The Governor should expect to be asked about the CP' Gas Pipeline "proposal",
            that came to the state outside the AGIA ' process . Jim Bowles and I spoke today in order
            to get clarity on what the Governor and he might say in response to an enquiry on this
            subject .  I told him that I would suggest to the Governor that she reiterate what she has
            already said , as follows:



             'We are focused on our AGIA'      process and we will be looking at (or reviewing) the CP'
            proposal when time allows."



             Jim indicated that he would say something supportive of that statement ,             such as:




             "We recognize that the state must focus on the AGIA ' process , but we are assured they
            will review our proposal in due course ." He may go on to say something like the
            following:
                                                         4




                                                                                                         PRA_GSP01_0009295

             "The Cook Inlet LNG Agreement represents an excellent model and we believe that it could
            be used on the ANS gas pipeline project as well."




             I think this covers everything .   Please call me at #317-4728 if you need something
            further.    I do apologize that this event has so many moving parts and requires such formal
            structure !   Thanks very much for your support Governor ! Reaching this Agreement is
            completely due to your willingness for us to work on the issues.



             Marty
