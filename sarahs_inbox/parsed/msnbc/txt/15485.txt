            Governor - received a phone call from the Major regarding the Marines. There are several
            that have to deploy on Wed. a.m. So would be unavailable for noon on Wed. They would all
            be available if you were able to address them on Tues. When you are available - 3:00/3:30
            p.m.  Janice
