           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on your new son... I just wanted to send you a note to let you know what a
           wonderful journey you are going to be on having a child with Down Syndrome. I have a
           niece with Down Syndrome and she is the joy of our lives. She is so full of love and
           happiness as is typical. You are truly blessed. Congratulations again.

           Ruth
