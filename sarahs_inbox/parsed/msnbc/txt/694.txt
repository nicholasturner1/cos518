Todd,



I checked in Kris's, the Governor's and around my couch and didn't see it. I ran into Bob Cockrell
and he said you were in the car with Sarah and wondered if it might be there. He said it was parked
at the airport and can check if you need him to.

I've misplaced my pocket daytimer address book, maybe in the Anchorage office. If anyone comes
across my black daytimer please let me know.



Thanks
