               I thank you so much for pulling this together. You are a professional and giving person . Your name is so respected
               and we look up to you too . It was a educational and for me a emotional caring time in my life. We have Lorrie too and
               your mom was dynamite.

                Our Alaska Native Sisterhood Camp 2 sisters have been extremely busy organizing a Southeast
                Alaska Native Women's Conference that begins today; $25 registration - there are limited
                scholarships ! I am forwarding you a copy of the wonderful program for the next three days
                featuring speakers such as Florence Sheakley, Laird Jones, Ruth Demmert and panel: Alberta
                Aspen, Corrine Ragu and Micalyn Kunz McGhee, Iva Graywolf, Healing Ceremony, and a
                number of others. Iva will be speaking about suicide prevention . Hopefully our local Native
                organizations will allow interested staff to participate in this conference and support our local
                ANS Camp 2.

                The theme for the conference speaks for itself, "Making a Difference: Knowledge of Our Mothers
                keeping our Culture alive". The conference pays tribute in many different and creative ways;
                something you don't want to miss out on ! Please see the various forms that come with the
                packet.

                If you know of any person who would be interested in attending this conference please share the
                news; we need community support. There is a welcome dinner planned this evening; we are
                going to cook: Grilled King Salmon, Roast Pork, rice, buttered corn, salad and a dinner roll.
                Dessert too! Come and visit; bring those special people in your life; grandmother, mom; tell your
                family! Let's make a difference together.
