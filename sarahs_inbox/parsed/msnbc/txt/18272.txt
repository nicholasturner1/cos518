         Dear Mr. Crapo:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

         Dear Governor Palin,



         I support your cuts to the 2007 capital budget. I didn't think the legislative process
         was open and it turned into a feeding frenzy with many dubious projects.



         I hope your actions will lead to a better process next year.



         Thank you.
