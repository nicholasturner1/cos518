        Hi guys!



        Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



        Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name(s) to me for selection, then on to the
        legislature for confirmation.



        We need innovation in that seat. Both your names brought forward are great. Not sure why
        Ed Bd thinks it needs a nationwide search, which I heard recently. I'll ask Lynne Smith to
        check the status on that and ask what my input is worth in terms of their method of
        soliciting names.



        Thank you guys. You're awesome. Keep up the great work - I miss (six months later) our
        of rag-tag team of hardcore workerbees,. Maybe the crew can get together for a shin dig
        soon?  I know Kris and Todd miss the campaign folks too. Six months zipped by - I'd love
        for us all together. Don Benson, Mark Fish, Perdews, Mary, etc, all of us!
