                Subject: Heads up re: Rep. Wilson at reception tonight

              Governor:

              Rep. Wilson will be attending the reception tonight . If she complains about ferry service, we increased service to
              her communities (Petersburg , Wrangell, and Sitka) and ridership is up so far about 30% over last year . Sitka has
              5 day a week service to Juneau this summer from the fast ferry which is the boat it always wanted . We have
              worked very hard to improve service for these communities.

              There have been 3 mechanical problems with the ferries recently . Two of those problems were caused by union
              engineers making mistakes that led to equipment problems. The Issue of whether AMHS has to continue to use
              union engineers is up for negotiations now. The union is talking to legislators like Rep . Wilson and trying to cover
              its members by saying they were not allowed to buy the right parts by management and that it is a budget issue.
              AMHS management says that is absolutely not true. AMHS managers and I will be meeting with Rep . Wilson this
              week to politely explain the facts.
