Unbelievable, but not surprising. Thought you could appreciate. As I mentioned earlier when we
talked, Larry does a great job keeping me apprised of what's going on. He spoke to the Fairbanks
Chamber of Commerce yesterday on CON. He said that he even suggested a town hall meeting up
there w/Fairbanks Memorial and his group.

FYI, we had alot people ready to testify as it was scheduled for that, then Senator Davis decided to
close it only to invited testimony. This is why people want to move the capitol and put it reach of the
people, this cost us a few thousand $ that we can hardly spare and just threw it away.

Anna:

Wow, we are disappointed with Senate HESS. We had several patients lined up, Jeannine and
Richard were there, and everything got cancelled. We are not like the hospitals with excess
revenues in the multi-millions, this actually comes out of our wallets to pony up and pay for them to
be there. This is why it is difficult to get testimony in Juneau and why the government seems "out of
touch" to alot of Alaskans.
