         Governor,



        A while back when we met with Mayor Begich (not the last time in Anchorage but the time
        prior), he raise the issue of a lawsuit between the State and the Municipality. The
         lawsuit is regarding the membership of the Anchorage Metropolitan Area Transportation
        Solutions (AMATS).       You may recall the Ben Stevens legislation that started a legal battle
         as well as a political conflict between Ben and the Mayor. Department of LawlPrivolegedor
        Privileged or Personal but yesterday the courts ruled in what appears to be against the State.


         I have included an email from David Ramseur below requesting we join them in a statement.
         I am sure it will be just as friendly as the last time they requested we join a press
         release.

        I trust you heard about the decision in our long-standing AMATS case, which as we read it,
                                                                1

         found for the city (attached). We plan to issue a news release early next week on this and
         since it was a "friendly" lawsuit, would certainly welcome a quote from a state official
         such as you or the commissioner. Let us know if you want to join up.




         Thanks - David
