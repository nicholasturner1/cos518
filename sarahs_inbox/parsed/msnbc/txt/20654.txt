               Governor -
                   1)  Dan Saddler and the COS need to speak with you in regards to the Court of Appeals Judge Decision.
                      This needs to take place before noon on Friday , 08.29.08.
                   2) Commissioner Irwin and Marty have asked if they could speak with you in regards to in-state gasline
                      issue. I asked if this could wait until your return from out of state or if they would meet with the COS.
                      They responded that they need to meet with you before you go out of state.

               These can both be done by phone. Thanks, Janice
