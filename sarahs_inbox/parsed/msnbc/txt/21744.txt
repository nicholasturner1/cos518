              Interesting how VOT, your critics and "a majority legislator " tried to take a tool out of
              your toolbox to get your message out.



              Equate that to what Therriault did today. He essentially handicapped a tool of Senate
              ACES opponents by mentioning the possibility of the stalling tactic, that the media picked
              up, that put Bert, Huggins, and probably Lyda on the defense. By that move he essentially
              said, "if they run out the clock, their motives are suspect."



              Taking away one of their tools. Brilliant.
