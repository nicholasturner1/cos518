          Awesome place .    If you hear of potential funding sources send them to Juneau Christian
          Center's Hub.

          Just toured Juneau's HUB... what an awesome place for teens this will be! Said I'd do all
          I could to help find funds (they need $500g more to open), esp since I vetoed state funds
          for it - be of the church relationship.



          If we get a chance to put a plug in for the HUB with Rasmussen or other funders, let's do
          so. Thanks
