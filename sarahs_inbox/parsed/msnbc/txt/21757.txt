              Just talked to Sen Thomas. He says Lesil needs to be shored up, Stevens too.., no changing
              Lyda's mind.. .Betty needs shoring up (she already told me she's good at 25). Says he's
              talking to Balash again this aft.

              Governor,

              The ever-changing schedule for today is House Finance at 1:00 p.m. and Senate Finance at
              1:30. We still appear to be in good shape in the House. The Senate Finance outcome is
              sure to disappoint... as expected-.but overall we're o.k. for now.



              For today, it could be helpful for you to touch base with these senators:
