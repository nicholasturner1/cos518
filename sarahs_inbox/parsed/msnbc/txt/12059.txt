           Governor:



           The last I heard was DOT was. set to take public testimony at a meeting

            in Eagle to gauge support (some local leaders were saying the wanted the

           project)but weather was preventing their plane from flying into the

            If we do not hear from Leo tonight, I will check with him in the

           morning.
