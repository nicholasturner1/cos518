               Barbara is in Anchorage today so I just requested the Director of Teaching and Learning
               Support contact Mrs. Gray and get back to me. I will forward the update as soon as I get
               it.

              One stopped me after my principals sppech to say huge truancy issues in her school Brevig
              Mission. No DA's office help, no enforcement, needs help.



              Mrs Gray, 642-4021. I told her someone would call. Pls let me know who from dept of ed (or
              whomever in another dept?) will be contacting her. I'd like the info today so I know it's
              taken care of. Thanks. Pls pass on to Barbara also.
