                Subject : DNR 50hp Regulation Package Legal Questions
                Dear Attorney General Colberg,

                    Please see the advanced copy of a letter from our organization, Kenai Area Fisherman 's Coalition
                (attached) regarding legal questions in reference to certain aspect of DNR's Kenai River 50hp Regulation
                Package . We believe there may be constitutional and state statute aspects that require further review.
                There is a portion of these changes that call for the removal of a select group of citizens from the
                resource that we find unjustifiable and arbitrary . We have tried to resolve these issues with DNR
                leadership without success.

                   We would appreciate further scrutiny of these changes before your agency signs off on them.

                Thank You,

                Dwight Kramer
                KAFC Chairman
