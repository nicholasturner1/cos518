                 Subject: John Doe v. State of Alaska - State Supreme Court decision

               Dear Governor Palin,
                   The state supreme court just issued a decision declaring that the registration requirements of the Alaska Sex
               Offender Registration Act cannot be applied to persons who committed their crimes before the law was passed in
               1994. They determined that retroactive application of the law to sex offenders before 1994 would violate the ex
               post facto provision of the constitution . The state (us) had attempted to enforce the law retroactively and we have
               lost. I will forward you a copy of the decision shortly. Tatis
