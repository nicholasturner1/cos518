            I just called into his show while I'm here in fairbanks (pls note that on schedule Janice,
            after my 2:40-3:40 BOG meeting), and our once extremely supporter radio host was less than
            enthusiastic this time. He said he's been trying for four months to get me booked for his
            show as a call-in and all he's gotten is the "run around" he said. So... He's going to
            personally email me concerns and requests and is asking that I book time next week. He
            wasnt a happy camper - I told him we'd try harder and I was certainly willing to
            communicate better with him and his audience.
