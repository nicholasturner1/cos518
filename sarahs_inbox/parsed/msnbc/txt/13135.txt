                Subject: letters on proposal to sue leaseholders to produce

              Dear Governor Palin, I know you have also received letters from ten house democrats and now two senate
              democrats asking us to prepare a "litigation team" to sue producers to commit to ship gas in the yet to be built
              pipeline. My staff will be meetin g with me next week on suggestions for a response . Privileged or Personal M

              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                                This is largely es ara s idea, hewas
              speculating a ou is as a p an over a wee ago .           in   a pa isan posturing is meant to make the majority
              uncomfortable as all of the cosigners are democrats . In any event this is to confirm that yes we also have the
              letters and I expect we will follow up with you or Mr. Tibbles next week. Talis
