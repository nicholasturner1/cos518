           Dear Governor Palin,




           The National Republican party needs you. You would be a perfect running mate for Sen.
           McCain.  With you beside him, our party can win the upcoming Presidential election. I
           realize how much you must love Alaska, and I'm sure that you want to stay there. However,
           I implore you to come to our rescue. Please show the rest of the country that there is a
           wonderful, God fearing, family oriented, capable, conservative female public servant, who
           has the proven ability to lead our party and our nation. You WILL be the first lady
           President of the United States, if you will be our first lady Vice President.



           God bless you and your family.



           Sincerely,

           Trask Buxton

           65 year old lifelong Republican patriot
