                 Dear Governor Palin, This is to give you a heads up. This may a story shortly. Talis

                 Folks , I am sending this note to let you know that the APOC approved at its commission
                 meeting last week a referral of lobbyist Ashley Reed to this office for consideration of criminal
                 prosecution . (I just learned this today, by the way .) Apparently he has a 21 year history of late
                 and incomplete reporting under the lobbyist registration and reporting requirements. Patty
                 Ware, staff at APOC, is putting together a report which will be provided to the AG. However,
                 she is not ready to send it yet and thinks it may take her a few weeks . I am giving you this
                 forewarning because the commissioners acted in an open meeting . Because the request for
                 the referral was made in public meeting , there may be press interest.
