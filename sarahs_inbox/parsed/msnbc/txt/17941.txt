          Just had a visit from Sen. Therriault. He's concerned they might actually not get this
         done tonight. He's concerned that the Administration not paint the entire legislature as
         the problem. He thinks the press is beginning to understand who is exerting leverage from
         the Senate Majority. Also, he noted that Bill McAllister has posted the House offer of
         earlier today or at least pieced it together so the press will know the House had a plan
         to go out, its essential pieces , and that the Senate Majority wasn't going to agree.




          Gene wanted us to know the Senate Minority was in agreement with the House plan.
         Obviously, if we thought the House offer was acceptable (??), the House Majority thought
         it acceptable, and perhaps the House Minority thought it acceptable (??? I don't know on
         this one), then the holdup is in the Senate Majority. Accordingly, if the session does go
         down without a complete agreement, I'd recommend we shine the light where the problem is-
         Senate Majority Leadership.




          Just a thought, but I do think there is merit to Gene's request that we not paint the
         entire legislature with "Why couldn't they do it in time" brush.
