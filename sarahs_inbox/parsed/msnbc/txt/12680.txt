            Am so excited to hear about your latest work in progress . The day I flew in the King Air
            with you,  you looked so exhausted -- and I felt a little worried about you, to see you so
            tired.



            I'm still amazed at the energy you ' ve had. I was completely floored to hear your news.
            When I was pregnant , I definitely slowed down -- and you could tell I was off my mark.



            How wonderful for you and Todd . And how nice it will be for all of us to have a new baby
            in our midst . I always thought the world would be a better place if our leaders could sit
            in a chair at the start of each day and hold a baby.



            You will be one of those rare leaders in history , who will have the ability to do so.



            Blessings on your family.
