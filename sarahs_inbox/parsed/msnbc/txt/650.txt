  Below are a few points and the timestamps within the Hour 2 mp3 of the Eddie Burke show for
  today. The show is typically written over by noon the following day.

  31:30 - Meyer saying he thought it was good for Bill Allen to be in the gallery during the 2006
  PPT vote, but then later waffled on what he really meant by that.

  41:00 - Lyda starts out. says "[Cowdery] was already excused." When Eddie says "he wasn't
  already excused, he just issued a press release saying 'I have decided i won't partake in the
  special session."' Lyda says he was excused in May, along with other Senators.... tried to steer
  the conversation towards Cowdery being sick. Lyda gets more defensive than I've ever heard her
  in public.

  50:00 - Senator French told Eddie that he never voted on whether Cowdery should be excused.
  Does not know of any rule where the Senate President can excuse anyone.

  Eddie calls Lyda on the carpet at the end of the show, says he's disappointed in Kevin & Lyda for
  not standing up and cleaning their own house.
