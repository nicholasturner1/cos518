              You sure knew how to wake me up from a dead sleep this morning ! You must have been busting at the seams
              wanting to tell us all. I'm so excited for you and for our state . Your acceptance speech was outstanding . Everyone
              looked great. Tell Piper that she did great and that her hairstyle shows really good on TV 0.
              All other news has taken a back seat nationally and the tourists visiting the capitol today are chomping at the bit to
              get hpme and brag to their friends and family about where they were the day...
              I, along with everyone else, will be doing everything I can to help hold down the fort here in your absence. We
              miss you though . See if you can't convince the campaign to swing through Alaska (including Juneau!) in the next
              couple of months.
              Congratulations and Good Luck!! And remember to take care of yourself.

               Hi Sharon,
               I CC'd you to this e-mail earlier. Let me know if I can be of any help with the footage I have . The footage I
               have and my approach present the governor in a bright and positive light , and can be very helpful. You can
               direct news agency's to me, J will make sure they get only the very good stuff. We can also think of perhaps
               creating a film about her , with what I already have and more we can shoot between now and the elections. I
               was approached by NBC for footage, and I want to be coordinated with the governor of what I release to them.
               I love her and what she stands for and want to make sure she is shown only in the most positive way.
               Please convey my e-mails to her and let me know if and how we can cooperate.
               Thanks,
               Elan

             Subject: Governor's web page unscheduled service interruption



             The Enterprise Technology Services Help Center has been advised of a
             service interruption to the Office of the Governor's web page.
             This service interruption affects any person attempting to connect to the Office of the Governor's web
             site.
             Technicians are working towards resolving this problem, related to an extremely high volume of traffic
             due to the recent announcement of Governor Sarah Palin's selection to be the Vice Presidential running
             mate of John McCain.
             Duration of the interruption at this time is unknown.

             If you have questions, please call the State of Alaska Service Center at
             1-888-565-8680 and press option 4 for the ETS Help Center.
