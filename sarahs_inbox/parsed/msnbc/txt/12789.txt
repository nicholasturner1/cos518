            I talked w/Denise.      what she told Lyda's office was about a brief

            conversation at first pitch where Denise told you that while she wasn't

            thrilled about the money being cut she certainly understands. And that

            you expressed appreciation for the work that they do and that it may be

            revisited in the future. She acknowledged that there were no promises

            made.



            It was a .courtesy conversation in passing; not what Lyda's office is

            trying to suggest.



            She called to let us know because she found Ginger's comments to be so

            contrary and wanted to go straight to the source. I reiterated the

            event activities-from the t-shirt to the pitch and the great time we

            had.     We also talked about the picture in the press while you were in
                                                                    1

             Unbelievable that she ' d tell Denise that. Once I was reminded that the

             Miner's pr lady ' s name was Denise , of course I acknowledged being

             escorted by her to throw the pitch , and to receive the t-shirt that I

             then wore to Kuwait (it was on tv and the Miners said they were proud to

             see it).



             Please tell Mark I appreciate his info, and that I do remember Denise.

            Nope, never any promises made at all. As you said for the Valley, you

                                                                     2

            only visited the miners when you threw out the pitch.         Aside from that

            there were no other visits or meetings pertaining to those specific

            Valley projects . Mark told me that according to Denise at the Miners,

            Ginger from Lyda's office called her to say that she was in a meeting

            with the Governor last week and that the Governor has no recollection of

            talking w/Denise or supporting the Miners. Mark told Denise that the

            Governor certainly remembers visiting and throwing out the first pitch

            and that she is supportive of the work they do but that does not

            translate to funding . Mark said Denise was more concerned about the

            Governor not supporting them as opposed to funding. Just before you're

            supportive of what someone is doing for their community; doesn't mean

            that it is the state's responsibility to provide financial support. I

            have a message into Denise to follow- up and find out more.

            Subject: Lyda



            Harris just did a press conf where he repeated Lyda's disingenous

            comments from last week re: my " promise to NOT veto projects"...

            supposedly I traveled the state , visiting vetoed projects , and according

            to Lyda I "got educated and promised not to veto the projects if they

           got back in the (supplemental ) budget ". I totally disagree with Senate

           and House leaders repeating Lyda's claim.



           When we asked , Lyda listed valley Recycling project visit and

           committment    ( yet I have not visited the center and did not know the gal

           Lyda said I promised ); Mat-Su Miners baseball field ( Kris was with me- I

           threw out the first pitch, did not "tour " anything and made no promises

           of no veto ); and Lyda couldnt recall what other projects , but claims
                                                            3

            there must be many.



            Russ believed another project being touted as veto - proof, via my

            promise , came after touring the Anchorage port - again Kris was with me

            - no promise was made except to say I wanted to put it in a bond pkg so

            voters could confirm that project as a state priority.



            Can you think of anything else that she and Harris could be

            misconstruing as my " visits and promises to NOT veto"... I know she's

            wrong but we must now spend valuable time proving her wrong . Thanks.
