              MESSAGE:
              Hello, Governor Palin!

              I just wanted to say that I appreciate you standing tough with the big oil
              companies.  it is refreshing and encouraging to see a public official such as
              yourself not bowing to the big corporations. Thank you for standing strong for
              political/professional ethics!

              As well, thank you for handling the "Hottest Governor in the US" publicity with
              professional grace.  Your professional people-savvy demeanor is a great example to
              others of dignity and self-respect. Thank you for being a good role model for
              girls/women.

              I also support your stance in wanting to manage the surplus oil revenues wisely for
              the future.   I am all for money management decisions that will bless future
              generations of Alaskans -- we are blessed today, but we should be good stewards of
              these funds for our children. Please push to invest/save as much as possible for
              future years.

              Thank you for all your hard work!!!

              Karen Biggs,
              Anchorage, AK
