         Two seats. And the nsp says event begins at 8pm - do they really need me to get there at
         7:30 to wait for it to begin?

        Governor - Update on the Dare to Care Fashion Event for Thursday, 07.12 @ 7:30 p.m. @
        Nordstroms.




        I spoke with Bonnie Faulk's niece - Bettsie Wild. This is a Charity Event that will
        benefit many kids in the community. Bettsie would love your presence and also the
        presence of your daughters. It will just be a relaxing event for you to watch. Bettsie
        did say that they would be doing several door prize drawings and would love to have you
        pull the names if you would like.



        Please let me know how many will be attending so that she can have seats for you all.



        Thanks, Janice
