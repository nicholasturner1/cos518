           The Governor has been invited by Mayor Itta to see the Whaling event firsthand between April 23 and May 6.
           Would that be a better time to go?

           Governor,

           Before I begin looking at your schedule , do you want to try and get to Barrow in the next two
           weeks - before whaling season begins? Or shall I just try to send Tom Irwin?

           Please provide guidance.

           Thanks,
