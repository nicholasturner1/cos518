         Governor-the criteria for veto was based on the cabinet discussion around life health
         safety infrastructure etc.  We do not have lists of individual communities too priorities.
         Some of the larger cities have resolutions or books of projects but not necessarily in
         priority order.  Legislators or the regional delegations get together and decide what goes
         in.

         We need to figure out best we can what top priority/project each local community submitted
         and try to fund it and no lower priority items - was that criteria used in veto
         recommendations?
