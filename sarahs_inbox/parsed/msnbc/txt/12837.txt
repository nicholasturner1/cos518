            Thanks John. We'll be ready for media response on this, I anticipate today, be we'll
            probably see another day like yesterday where we're bombarded with the anti-board action
            messages. Thanks

            We have received numerous telephone calls and = faxes that were clearly precipitated by
            Defenders of Wildlife.  Y= esterday afternoon, the calls were coming in at a'rate of about
            one ev= ery thirty seconds.



            The calls follow the script described by = Beth. Many of them were downright profane.
            Clearly, wolves = provoke a lot of emotion if not much thought on the part of the people =
            that are calling.



            We have worked out a system with DF&G = for dealing with the calls.

           Too bad they're not = understanding that we DON'T allow aerial hunting - but I suppose

            The Defenders of Wildlife = has apparently sent out another letter asking its members to
            call and = email your office(s), including the D.C. office.



            In Juneau = alone, we have received about 2,000 emails and about 70 calls. The source =
            for both emails and calls is out of state - only 1 email was from an = Alaska address.



            The message being sent has a slightly = different twist , along the lines of . we hear you
            might be tapped to be on = the McCain ticket and if so we won't vote for you. But then
            goes on to = include the messages previously sent : Alaska is allowing aerial hunting of =
            wolves against voter mandates , the Legislature is corrupt and once = again isn't
            listening to Alaskans who don't want aerial hunting, etc. =



            I'm confident that we will see these kinds of spikes in = attention as this organization
            (and others) use Miller's legislation and = message as a fund-raising rallying cry.



            We will continue to = work with F&G and the resources we have at hand to get out Alaska's
