MESSAGE:

Dear Gov. Palin-



    I am writing to congratulate you and your husband in the birth of your son, Trig. I welcome you to
"our world". As a parent of an 8 year old with DS, I too feel as if God has intrusted me and my
husband with the utmost care of our daughter, Laura. I encourage you to sit back and enjoy your
new bundle of joy for a while. However, after the newness has worn off, as I am sure you have been
briefed by others, it will be time to get to work with little Trig. I encourage you to start with Part C
services in your state as soon as possible. I also encourage you to ensure that Trig is checked from
head to toe and complete thorough medical testing to rule out any possible additional diagnosis.
Having said all of this, your job is already heavy enough. We will join you in prayer for your new
endeavors with Trig. May God richly bless each of you during the coming months and years ahead.



In Him,

Rebekah Fish
