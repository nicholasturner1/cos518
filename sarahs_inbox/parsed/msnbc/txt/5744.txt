            I agree.

            The only thought, is that they are using the Governor's official portrait and the Governor's
            title. They need to change the picture and use Candidate Sarah Palin to reflect our true
            wishes.

            Hey Folks,

            Just a reminder, we told the Alaska Family Coalition that the Governor would not be making a statement
            on this issue . However, we did say that anything that was said on the campaign trail is okay to use. Looks
            like they did their research!

            Sharon
