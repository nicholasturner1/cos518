             Hi Frank:

            Thanks for attending Industry Appreciation Day. Please let the Governor know that
            she was a super hit with everyone. I deeply appreciate her signing the resolution for
            Aaron Goforth... his widow will cherish it for the rest of her life. Good job on the Bill
            signing it went smoothly!

            I have heard rave reviews from the Governor's meeting with the commercial
            fishermen. In my opinion the meeting completely restored her creditability with most
            of the fishermen. Some fishermen are going to have a' wait and see attitude" but
            even they said it was a great meeting.

            Thanks again.


            Jack
