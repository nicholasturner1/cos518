             And any other scheduled events - I know there are plenty today- nothing's on the calander
             again and it make for an inefficient use of time to try to remember these events/appts
             without having them recorded on the sched . I know it's been a frustrating process to get
             the scheduling to run smoother - I think if I can just start plugging into the official
             calander things that have to be there, then we ' ll save time and I can get on with other
             things . I'm happy to do it myself be it's still not working efficiently and I spend quite
             a bit of time chasing down event details.
