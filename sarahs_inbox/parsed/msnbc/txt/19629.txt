     I     Subject: Congressman Boehner/Governor's Letter



           After several discussions with Capitol Hill = staff, I think it might be a good idea for
           you to send a letter to = the 26 Republicans and certain oil state Democrats who voted for
           the = Pelosi energy package partly on the basis of their support for the Alaska =
           provisions in that bill.



           I can draft such a letter for your review. = However, before doing so, I am thinking that
           it might be a good idea = for you to talk with Mr. Boehner about whether this would be
           helpful = to him and others who are seeking a more production oriented approach to =
           comprehensive energy policy.



           If this makes sense, I'll await your interaction= with Congressman Boehner and his
           entourage.
