         Subject: Williams meeting confirmed




         Janice,

         I just received confirmation that the Williams group will fly to meet Governor Palin
         tomorrow (Friday, July20th) at 4:00 pm Michigan time (1:00pm Alaska time). I am having
         our office confirm a meeting room at the Grand Traverse Resort and Spa, along with
         teleconference capacity.  Once I have the meeting room and phone number information I will
         convey it to all of you, as well as to Williams.

         Thanks everyone,

        Marty
