              Thank you for forwarding this to me. I downloaded the story on one of the boys laptop and
              read it out loud. You are who you are because of the wonderful parents you have. How
              proud you can be. Janice

             WASILLA

             -- Think Gov. Sarah Palin is an interesting person?



             You haven't met Chuck and Sally

             Heath, the Wasilla couple responsible for bringing Alaska's

             first female governor into this world. From hunting and hiking

             to fishing and skiing, there's very little Alaska's first

             parents have not tried outdoors. And at 69 and 67, respectively,

             they show no signs of slowing down.



             "When it comes to taking advantage of all of Alaska' s amazing

             outdoor opportunities, they seize those opportunities --

             spring , summer , winter and fall," said Palin of her parents.

             "They go without a lot of sleep, I think, but they still

             have more energy than anybody else I know.
