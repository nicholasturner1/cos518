              Governor:

              I spoke with Mrs. Kozloff yesterday. She said she has been speaking with several friends who are union
              members and that is where she got her information. She said her main concerns were really overcrowding in the
              prisons and understaffing of corrections officers. I explained to her that we are working towards adding 1500
              beds with the new Mat-Su prison and that we should be adding 40 officers. She said that was very helpful
              information for her to know and seemed very thankful for the call. She said she was still not sure everything was
              OK with corrections so I let her know she could meet with Joe or talk with him on the phone. She said she
              appreciated that, but it would not be necessary.
