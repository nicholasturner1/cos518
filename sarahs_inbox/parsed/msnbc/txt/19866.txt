          Subject: Email




          Kopp's dispatcher sent me an email nearly two weeks ago- it was forwarded to other depts
          but was never forwarded to me. I had to ask for it, had to track down the accuser' s name,
          and had to follow up in the search for this significant piece of communication. In
          addition, many other emails pertaining to "Kopp/Sexual Harassment" were evidently sent
          over the past week, but not one was forwarded to me. This is not good- it should be common
          sense to forward these to me, especially the one from the former dispatcher involved in
                                                                1

           Kopp's accusations ( esp with her claim in the email that she has her file of evidence and
           had wanted me to see it).

             As I have been requesting , this communication system must change . A significant email
           such as the one mentioned here that was forwarded to Boards and Commissions , special
           assistants , plus other areas should have been forwarded to me and or Talis and Nizich. If
           it was a receptionist in the receiving departments who did not know how important this was
           (perhaps she does not read the paper ?) then please work with your receptionists /admin.asst
           folks to instruct them on this type of issue. It really can not happen again.

            I know we get a ton of emails , but these of the Kopp / sexual harassment nature should
          have obviously been flagged though and not buried in any communication file somewhere.
          Thank you
