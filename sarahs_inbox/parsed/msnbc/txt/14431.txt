         MESSAGE:

         My comment is but a small simple one. With humbleness I thank the Lord for the priviledge
         of reading articles from the Family Research Council about Governor Palin having their
         fifth child. And yes, Trig is not the last Blessing The Lord will bestow upon the Palin
         family. Senator clinton and Speaker peloski are poor examples of women in high places, but
         I would gladly and proudly vote.for Palin if she would ever consider running for the
         highest office in the land. I Praise the Lord and thank the Lord for people like Palin. I
         know everyone doesn't always agree on everything, but the people/residents of Alaska
         should be happy and proud to have a Governor such as Palin.

         Thanks for your time .......
