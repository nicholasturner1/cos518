          Dear Governor Palin,

                 I have received a draft manuscript of Dr. Claus-M. Naske's book A History of Alaska
          Statehood.  He was the chair of my graduate committee and has authored several books on
          Alaska history.  He wanted to know if you would be interested in writing a short
          introduction to his book. I have the draft of the book and can deliver it to you in
          Juneau on Monday if you are interested. He would like to know if you are interested or
          not.  If not, he will look to someone else. If you are let me know and I will tell him
          and get the manuscript to you. I don't think he is expecting you would write much but I
          do think he would be thrilled to have a short intro by you. Let me know. Thanks Talis
