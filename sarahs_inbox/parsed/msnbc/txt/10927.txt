            I think this is excellent and look forward to the public receiving this info so they
            better understand our position . If you can think of other easy-to - understand reasons why
            their offer just set us back to the Murkowski days , of course I'll hope to see those
            additions to the letter . Thanks!

            Subject: Draft Mulva Letter




            Gov:




            Below is the text of the draft letter we discussed earlier today. If it meets with your
            approval (and please feel free to edit it) we can get it out tomorrow morning.
            Commissioner Irwin is speaking at the Anchorage Chamber tomorrow at Noon--he could talk
            about it after it has gone to Mulva.



            Let me know how to proceed.



            Joe
