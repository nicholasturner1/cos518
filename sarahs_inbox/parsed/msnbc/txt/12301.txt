             > It will be a few months before spring arrives in Alaska, but locals aren't sweating it
             (so to speak). March brings some of the state's most exciting events, like the Iditarod
             Trail Sled Dog Race and the World Ice Art championships, to name a few. As the countdown
             to the summer season begins , there's a lot to look forward to in the summer of 2008.

             > Whistle stop service reaches the Chugach

            > Alaska ' s Chugach National Forest is the nation ' s second - largest national forest and a
            source of endless recreational opportunities . Now, the Alaska Railroad is making it even
            easier to access through a new-in- 2008 service designed to bring guests to the heart of
            the forest. The Alaska Railroad is laying the groundwork for a series of five backcountry
            "whistle stop " stations to be built in the forest . The first , at Spencer Glacier , opened
            late last summer and includes a covered deboarding area , viewing area , established trails,
            guided hikes with Forest Service personnel and campsites . The remaining four stations will
            be built over the next few years and the trail system will be developed to connect some of
            the stations. This will give visitors access to Alaska's backcountry without the hassle of
            packing in equipment or securing permits independently. For more information about rail

            > Throughout the state, new facilities and attractions are being introduced to better
            serve visitors . Here ' s a look at what 2008 will bring for Alaska visitors:



            > *     Late summer 2008 will see the opening of the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors
            Center . The new 35 , 000-square foot center will provide visitor information and trip
            planning services ; showcase the local Athabascan culture; house interpretive exhibits and
            a theater ; and act as a community - gathering place.

            >  *     In Denali National Park, a completely renovated Eielson Visitor Center will open
            for the first time since 2004 . The National Park Service hopes the center will be the
            first building in Alaska and in the national park system to be certified platinum under
            the U . S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
            program.

                 Subject : Becker Letter for Solicitor General Feb 20081.doc
                February 19, 2008

                The Honorable Paul D. Clement
                Solicitor General of the United States
                Office of the Solicitor General
                950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
                Washington, DC 20530-0001

                Re: Southeast Alaska Conservation Council et al. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

                Dear Solicitor General Clement:

                I have been an Alaska Commercial Fisherman for over 40 years. During that time I have always
                been involved in the broad array of issues that could have an impact on the clean water and
                habitat that is vital to the health of my industry. Such is the case of the Kensington Mine located
                near one of our very successful salmon fisheries in Lynn Canal.

                For nearly 20-years other Southeast Alaska Gillnetters and I have followed Coeur Alaska and
                Goldbelt in their efforts to open the Kensington Gold Mine and build a dock at Cascade Point.
                They have frequently requested our input to insure that the developments would have no impact
                on a valuable fishery. Our communications have been productive and resulted in a mutually
                acceptable project that was permitted by all the agencies in July 2005.

                It was important that during construction, Coeur Alaska hired and contracted locally. In fact,
                over 50% of a plus 380 person work force was Native-affiliated. Unfortunately, those year-
                round, high paying jobs were halted by the injunction.

                We ask that you join Coeur Alaska and Goldbelt Inc. and urge the Supreme Court to review the
                decision of the Ninth Circuit Court in which SEACC, Lynn Canal Conservation, and the Sierra
                Club sued the agencies for granting 404 permits to Coeur Alaska and Goldbelt. It is our opinion
                that the agencies were correct in issuing these permits and that the Ninth Circuit Court has made
                a questionable reading of the Clean Water Act in this case.

                The decision by the Ninth Circuit Court vacating Goldbelt's 404 permit is a gross injustice to the
                intent of Congress when it enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act providing these
                lands to Goldbelt with the intent that they be used for economic development and betterment of
                Goldbelt's stockholders. It is disappointing that SEACC, Lynn Canal Conservation and the
                Sierra Club are using this lawsuit to block Goldbelt's ability to develop its land in an
                environmentally responsible manner.
