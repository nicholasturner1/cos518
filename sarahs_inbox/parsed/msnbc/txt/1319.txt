  Hi Beth,

  My two cents: I think we should rework the statement: "Todd and Sarah fish in Bristol Bay with their
  children - Track, Bristol, Willow, Piper and Trig". It is not an accurate depiction since Trig is a new arrival
  to the Palin family.

  We have updated your bio page on our website to include Trig.

  NGA has also updated your bio page to include 2008 session materials, which were already on our state
  site, and Trig on its website.
