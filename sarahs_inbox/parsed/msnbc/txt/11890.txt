             Because these ARE lies, he must retract.

             Hi Sharon,




             I only posted that comment about Ivy after I had confirmed it with three different
             sources . in fact this story has been out there for months including some school employees
                                                                    1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0011487

              who wondered why state employees were shuttling kids to school on state time.




             if you are telling me it is not true then I will retract the comment.




             As far as Mat Maid, I have been getting information from very reliable sources and had no
             reason to doubt the comment about Joe Austerman moonlighting at Mat Maid. And for Ralph
             Carney's salary, I had several confirmations that his hourly wage was higher than what Van
             Treek ' s average hourly wage was.




             Again, if you'd like to provide me with additional information I have no problem
             retracting what I considered reasonable posts.




             Hope all is well. I saw your sister two weeks ago and she looks great.




             Cheers!

             Hi Andrew-



            I just read your most recent blog item regarding Ivy Frye and I feel compelled to respond.
              Ivy has never "shuttled' the Governor's children to school on state time-or any other
            time.  Furthermore, she has never even been asked to baby sit the Palin children. Where
            do you get this stuff? Leaving your readers with the impression that Governor Palin uses
            her staff for personal business is outrageous .  In fairness , I think you should retract
            the erroneous information that was posted . Andrew , I have noticed many errors in your
            blog postings - especially items dealing with Mat Maid. I just shake my head when I read
            posts such as the one about Joe Austerman getting paid twice or the one about Mat Maid
            hiring a new CEO who was getting paid more than Mr. Van Treek etc. I feel posting
            misinformation is a great disservice to Alaskans .  If you ever need clarification on
            anything, I hope you know you can always call me.



            Thanks,

            Sharon

             The Governor has NOT said the whole legislative process has been tainted .   However, the
             outcome has been colored by the guilty pleadings of two executives and the actions of a
             few legislators . That does not make the Legislature as a whole guilty.    Here ' s what she
             had to say last week:



                       "Aside from the corruption scandal where oil service company         executives have
             plead guilty to bribing certain lawmakers for a particular     oil tax outcome last year,
             and of course those corruption trials beginning            tomorrow , there ' s been a lot
             discussion out there in the public on that issue . There were obviously some lawmakers
             engaging in activities their          fellow lawmakers did not condone regarding the oil
             taxes and we have        many fine Alaskans serving in our Legislature .   They' re serving
             for the    right reasons and I do look forward to working with these legislators in        the
             coming weeks -and months-on new oil taxes."



             The audio file is attached.

             So just so I'm correct, no internal investigation has been done but the administration
             still feels the indictment of three lawmakers proves the whole legislative process was
             tainted. (I don't want to put words in your mouth but I'm trying to relay the truth as
             succinctly as possible. Let me know if I'm off base .... and yes that is an open ended offer
             regarding any subject :) .




             Also just a reminder if the governor has some time on Tuesday, I'd be honored to have her
             on as a guest on Mike Porcaro ' s talk radio program.




             Thanks.

            The Department of Law requested access to the evidence gathered by the Federal Bureau of
            Investigation.  That access was denied. We do not wish to hamper their investigations or
            prosecutions.  In the meantime, we continue to monitor the evidence presented in the
            trials.  Nevertheless, we do not comment on investigations.



            In this case, the public does have the plea agreements and testimonials from Rick Smith
            and Bill Allen.  They have admitted to taking illegal actions to corrupt the outcome of
            the legislative process.  Additional evidence is referenced in those documents as well as
            the indictments of the 3 former legislators.
