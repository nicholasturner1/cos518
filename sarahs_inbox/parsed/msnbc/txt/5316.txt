               We MUST, must remind that $300g has already been set aside by legislature for this - and
               we'll recoup contribution via lower tarrif its down the rd after contributing this amt.
               Amazing that the headlines are all about the $500g contribution.

              Palin gas line proposal calls for one-half billion dollar capital outlay

              Governor Palin conducted a press conference in Washington, D. C. this

              morning where she is outlining her gas pipeline proposal for members of

              Congress and federal authorities.



              The Governor says her Alaska Gasline Inducement Act will call for the state

              to make an initial capital outlay.



              The total capital risk is estimated at a billion dollars.



              Palin ' s Natural Gas Line Team leader, Deputy Natural Resources Commissioner

              Marty Rutherford says the state will share that expense evenly with a $500

              Million outlay.



              She says that will go toward the cost of obtaining a certificate from the

              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.



              Palin is scheduled to introduce her bill for the Legislature ' s consideration

              Friday.



             Developers will be asked to have their proposals ready by October . The goal

              is to select a proposal and submit a package for the Legislature's

             consideration by the end of January 2008 and to begin field work by that

             summer.




                                                                3




                                                                                                          PRA_GSP01 _0000395

              Prior to selecting a project , the process calls for a 60 day public comment

              period.



              Under her measure ,     applicants must provide for a minimum of five gas take

              off points in Alaska ,      commit to a local project headquarters in Alaska, and

              pledge to expand the pipeline project when new gas is available.



               Inducements for prospective gas line developers include lower tariffs and

               relaxed leasing laws.



               Palin is scheduled to return from Washington D. C. tomorrow. (Thursday)
