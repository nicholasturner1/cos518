         Governor - Pat Toomey just called and asked if you would call him directly. 610-360-6838.
         Mr. Toomey wants to speak with you in regards to: Alaska Politics. He said that if a
         call needs to be scheduled then we can go through his scheduler Stacey. I would be happy
         to set that up if needed. Janice
