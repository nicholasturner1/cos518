             MESSAGE:

             I would like to congratulate Gov. Palin on the birth of her beautiful son Trig. My son
             Jacob is 4 years old and has Down Syndrome as well. I can truely say her family's journey
             will be so special with their little guy. I know it will not always be easy but the reward
             is so great. I feel very privlidged to have been chosen to parent such a special
             blessing. And to know I share the same responsiblity as the Governor of the great state of
             Alaska, well that just makes me super proud! Thanks for doing the right thing and not
             being afraid to travel the harder road!
