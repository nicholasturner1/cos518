               Governor-

               Channel 11 (Andrea Gusty) is in town for the end of session. They would like a few minutes with
               you today to talk about how things are going. It will likely be very generic since they don't follow
               the session too closely. Russ can offer specifics on bill status if needed. Please let me know if you
               would like to fit this in today.
