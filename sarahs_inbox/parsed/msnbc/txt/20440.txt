           J- it's looking like I (finally!) don't need to be on official duty tomorrow- I'll just
           get personal stuff done at the wasilla house and maybe finally get Trig dedicated at our
           church service tomorrow. So...you can note that on TA/sched.

              Also, do u remember what time that Juneau Birth Center grand opening is today? and
           where?
