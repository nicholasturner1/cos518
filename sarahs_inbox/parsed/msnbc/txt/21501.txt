                   Subject: President of Mongolia's visit

                Your office and the international host team of Patricia and Shelley did a great job pulling together the events
                surrounding the visit of the President and First Lady of Mongolia . Craig Campbell received a friendship medal
                tonight from the president for his efforts in promoting that relationship between Alaska and Mongolia , and his wife,
                AnneMarie, hosted the first lady during the day . Sandy and I hosted the dinner tonight.

                The "merging" of our staffs is almost complete:)

                Your media crew has been extremely helpful while Kate has been out on leave-And , Kelly from my office stayed
                late last night working with Patricia and Shelley to finish the last minute details for tonight 's dinner for the
                President. I think Kelly may have a career in the international office . She is a linguist by background, good with
                protocol and details. She and Jay staffed the dinner tonight (with Kris Perry).

                Governor Hickel said to tell you "God bless you" and he's cheering for you.

                Sandy and I will be at the AFN dinner tomorrow night in Fairbanks for you-we'll be seated with Ken Johns. That's
                it for now.
