             Glad you're all back - look forward to hearing how things went - I'm anxious for teammates
             to be here so we can communicate where we are with Leggies and the public . There's a big
             difference betwen having you folks here, and not .., it's a secure and friendly atmosphere
             when you ' re near! Thanks for making that long trip and for doing so well with AGIA.
