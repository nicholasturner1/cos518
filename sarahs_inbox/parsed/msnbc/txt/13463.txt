            Dear Governor Palin,




            Recently on the Glenn Beck cable show, he talked about the addition of a son to your
            family.  Just wanted to congratulate you and your husband on the wonderful and wondrous
            gift God has put into your lives.



            Ciao and God bless .. .Jon Reynolds
