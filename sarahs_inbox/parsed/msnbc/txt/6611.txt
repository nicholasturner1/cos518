        Dear Mr. Poole:




        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response.to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



       I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
       under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



       I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
       to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



       I appreciate hearing from you!



       Sincerely,



       Sarah Palin

       Governor
