             Christine, I have sent the Iditarod material to Randy Ruaro last week put I know he is
             very busy.  Keep it on your list to remind me to follow up before the next ITC board
             meeting.. I am hoping we can get some commitment from the Governor soon. I hate to push
             this at this time with the Legislature nearing the end. LEO
