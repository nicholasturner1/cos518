                OK Mike. Keep your cell handy . Have to make a trip to a nearby restaurant to call as our rental house
                has no phone. My cell works but the minutes are .25 each whereas I can use a calling card from a pay
                phone for much less. Time will depend on what activites the group has planned [theres about 30 of us
                here]. Keep in mind that I have no problem with you calling me any time on my cell if something
                important needs to be addressed, and I carry my cell always [cell number is 907-351 -8854].

                Later SEB
