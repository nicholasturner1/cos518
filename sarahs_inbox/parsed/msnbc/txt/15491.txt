            No problem. We had it all set for Jerry and Janice even talked w/McHugh this morning to
            reconfirm that he would get her the proc. I'll have to follow-up. .

           Kris, thx for your help today. Sorry I had to call you spur of the moment. Email from
           Randy below. Governor, great improv. John Combs, benny cottle, diana straub all said it
           was a nice poem.

             No, Jerry didn't show up with the proclamation . I'm not sure what happened . I would have
            brought it myself had I known . The governor read a speech from a women ' s auxiliary group.
            She did great . I'll be looking for you in the newspaper.

             Ivy:



             Did Jerry ever show up with the proclamation ? Everything here went well , I covered two
            events, including SE Veterans where there was about 200 to 300 people .   ( My son and I may
            even end up in a photo in the newsletter )  Anna is covering the event tonight with Mike
            Huckabee at the Andersons ' house at Auke Lake.
