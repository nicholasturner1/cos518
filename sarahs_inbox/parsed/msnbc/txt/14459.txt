          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,




          My family and I would like to congradulate you and your family on the birth of your son,
          Tag! We saw his picture on the news and he is a beautiful baby.

          Words can hardly express how grateful we are for your expressions of love and hope for all
          of your children, what an example to a world that at times seems to regard our precious
          children as liabilities. We also want to say thank you for always keeping the good of all
          Alaskans foremost in your dealings with business and the legislature.



          Best wishes,

          Deb Harbison
