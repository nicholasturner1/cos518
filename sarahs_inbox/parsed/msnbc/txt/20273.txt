         Subject: Pt.Hope



         Press has reported numerous times that Pt Hope folks wrote me a letter a

         couple of weeks ago re: the wanton waste of caribou... I still have not

         seen that letter, pls track it down and let me know status of the issue.

         It was front page and I . still haven ' t heard anythig about it internally

         yet. (Maybe DPS has the issue and letter in its shop?)
