             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Sarah Palin,




             I have read a few articles on what you are doing in Alaska, wow in itself, thank you as an
             American as well.  However, I was drawn to you as a born-again Christian mom.



             The Lord keeps putting you into my mind and heart for what only He knows at this time,
             hence, I am writing you. I am 48, female, white, empty-nester, born again Christian, wife
             and very much an American and all of "which it stands".



             I would love to hear from you. You keep showing up in my world, magazine article, news
             statements etc.



             I like what I am reading of your passions for Alaska and family.                 Perhaps we have some
             things in our lives to work together?



             I understand this is not a professional business letter ........... He called I answered.
             I will say prayers for you and your family today , right now.



             Many blessings on your endeavors if we do not meet or speak.                I will support you in
                                                                  1

             Prayer from now on. Know this and feel lifted. Have you been praying for something in
             particular?  He is listening. I am not sure if I am the solution, maybe just part of
             conduit?



             In Him,

             Joan
