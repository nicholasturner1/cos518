              Subject: thank you for the reception last Friday

           Governor Patin , Commissioner Kreitzer, Ivy, and Erika,
           I wanted to formally thank you for the wonderful reception last Friday . It was a perfect project recognition event.
           A rare opportunity for work to be recognized by executives, plus enjoy refreshments in the charming Governor's
           residence. The team members felt appreciated, and we were comfortable in the gracious and hospitable
           atmosphere you created . It was very memorable for us , and we appreciated it.

            Regards,
            Kim Gamero
            Director of Finance
