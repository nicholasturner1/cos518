              Governor,
              Here are your draft comments for the In-State Gas Press Conference on Monday, July 7th. I have
              worked with Meghan Stapleton, Pat, Tom and Joe in putting them together, and everyone is
              comfortable. Meghan is also putting together a draft press release for your offices use.

              Additionally , Tom, Pat, Joe and I will be calling multiple individuals to give them a heads-up of the
              announcement late on Sunday and early Monday.

             Please let me know if you need anything further.
             Thanks,
             Marty
