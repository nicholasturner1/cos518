             I still think a legislative spouses' luncheon is a good idea- I'm happy to host it, and
             Ivy and Kris can help entertain (!). Kris may want to work the day in the Juneau office
             anyway on a variety of things.



             It could go a long way in building Leg relationships.



             Who wants to take this and run with it? Doesn't have to be a big darn deal, and I'd like
             it sooner rather than later. Thanks, all.
