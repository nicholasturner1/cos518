           From what I surmise the 19th is the "grand finale"

           I know how difficult it would be to cancel - how about sliding the Glennallen trip out a day or two,
           one side or the other?

           Importance: High

           Please know that the Governor has committed April 19 to be in Glennallen giving a speech at 1 1:00am to high
           school students; at 2:00pm meeting with Elders ; and 4-__? having dinner with the Elders, children, and
           community of Glennallen and surrounding villages (there is a large basketball tourney taking place and lots of
           visitors will be in Glennallen for the week , thus the invite to the Governor). It would be very hard to cancel this
           event.....

           Who from our administration is planning on going to the Elkins ' service, does anyone know?

           For consideration - trip to Ketchikan to attend memorial services for former-Rep. Jim Elkins

           April 19th - Ketchikan
           5:00 - 9:00 PM @ The Landing

           Both Kyle Johansen and Bert Stedman are almost certain to attend.

           Jim Elkins was a strong supporter of Governor Palin, and was a beloved figure in Ketchikan politics.

           If more information is required ... please let me know.
