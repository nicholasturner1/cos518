             Dan Fagan is talking about this ... a letter being leaked from the Governor ' s office. I'm
             just not sure if he is talking about the leak to ADN or if it was also leaked to him too.

             Kyle called me to authenticate the email he received - I told him to

             send what he received - which he did . I said - funny Kyle I don't see

             your name on the email string - he laughed and said he would not reveal

             his source.

             Sharon : Heartbreaking to know someone would have leaked my email this

             morning- Sunny said it had to have been sent to ADN within the first

             hour. I think it would do me good to ask Kyle how he received it - he

             won't tell me, but he 'll know that I know how improper it is for

             internal emails to team members to be leaked to reporters.
