                 June 1, 2006 . The terms expiring are Art Nelson (consultant and son-in-law of Congressman Young) and
                 Robert Heyano from Dillingham.

                 Looking at a Law memo from 1991 the removal provisions say "for cause " and "pleasure of the
                 governor." I'm having Law look at this right now to determine which it is.

                 Thanks,

                 Ivy
