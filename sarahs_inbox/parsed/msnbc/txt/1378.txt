MESSAGE:

Gov. Palin,

Before you ran for governor I saw you at an Aces hockey game in Anchorage. You were sitting right
in front of us with a lady who worked with you and another couple. The male half of the couple talked
your ear off the entire game. But as much as you were listening to him, you were watching the game.
And you were so on top of it, you'd ring your cowbell along with everyone else when the Aces scored.

I knew who you were from reading the paper and seeing the news, being the mayor of Wasilla. My
two friends with me did not know who you were. I told them to remember this day because one day
they'd know very well who you are.

I appreciate and adore having you run out state. It is the most relieving feeling knowing that another
true to the heart Alaskan is in charge. And this Alaskan has the same needs, wants, and cares that
the rest of us Alaskans do too.

Everything you do for Alaska is truly appreciated. Thank you for all your hard work, compassion, and
understanding.

Sincerely,

                                                   1                            ROSTON 02479
