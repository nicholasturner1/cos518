                Dillon just interviewed me on the state's reaction to Senator Stevens' posting. I said
                what you just mentioned and then elaborated in terms of your response to Carl
                Marrs and what we actually did in our budget requests. If he gets it right - and he
                usually does - I think we'll have a good response.

                I also conveyed your four messages. He said that his article was done but that
                he would include them on his blog.

                   This could put to rest those complaints that we are hypocritical be some are
                   claiming we recently asked for 141 earmarks - more than other admins have
                   asked for... and we knew that was not true.

                   Does the senator think he's punishing us for this by posting our requests? I look
                   at this as a good thing and was just thanked this weekend by the Transportation
                   secretary and Sen. McCain for showing leadership on this. Pres Bush also
                   acknowledged Alaska and asked us Gov's today to do what we can to help with
                   needed reform in committees where earmark abuse previously was the norm. He
                   was all about transparency and public discussion on earmark projects- he
                   sounded just like us.

                   Subject: State Earmarks/Stevens' Posting


                   Senator Stevens has just posted the State's 31 earmark requests on his website.
                   I think he believes that this will point out the discrepancy between your
                   stat'nents and our actions.

                   As I said to him this morning, I don't see any problem with the posting. We
                   believe that all of our earmarks pass muster in terms of the criteria the
                   Congressional delegation and the Bush administration have espoused.
