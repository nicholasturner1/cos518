            What event is being planned for recognizing our uniformed Alaskans

            who'll now receive the hunting/fishing licenses that we worked on this

            session? These troops are worthy of a good event to announce the benefit

            they can receive.



            Pls let me know when and where we'll do this before their fishing season

            really kicks off. Thanks



            Also- Randy- any word on what happened yesterday with the missing

            proclamation at the Mem Day ceremony?
