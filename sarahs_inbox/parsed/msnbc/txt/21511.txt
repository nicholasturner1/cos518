              Lt. Governor,



              I will have Mike Nizich work with DMVA Monday morning to make sure everything is in order
              regarding the disaster declaration. If approved, I think it is a good idea for you to
              deliver the news in person. How about if I ask Mike Nizich to contact Jay as soon as a
              final decision is made?                       _

              Subject: Kivalina disaster declaration heads up




              Governor,



              I received a briefing on Kivalina and the NW Arctic Borough's request for a state disaster
              declaration because I travel to Kivalina from Kotzebue on Tuesday. Apparently, the
              appropriate disaster cabinet folks have met and approved recommending you issue a disaster
              declaration with some modification of the Borough's request. I understand they are putting
              together a letter for General Campbell to sign and to forward the recommendation to you.
              I'm told you likely wont see that until Monday.



             I had been invited out there through Al Adams and the Borough about a month ago when
             Kivalina residents came to town so the trip was pre-planned. I see an opportunity for me
             to personally deliver the news in Kivalina for you on Tuesday (while you're sending out
             the press release from you and your office and making other appropriate notifications on
             Tuesday) if you want your office to coordinate with mine on such a thing. I filled Sharon
             in on the opportunity earlier today. If you want me to do something like this let me know
             who I can have my office coordinate with. Thanks much!


                                                                1
