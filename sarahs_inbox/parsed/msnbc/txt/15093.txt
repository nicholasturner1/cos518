               Randy,

               Could we have a coordinated discussion of the Administration's position on KABATA before
               too long? I think we are all heading in the same direction, but there are a lot of issues to be
               evaluated, and options explored. I'm not sure who should coordinate the discussion, but
               you're a good candidate. Is that something you can set up? Thanks.

               -Pat

               We are waiting for some responses from KABATA that should fmally allow us to evaluate the project
               and decide whether and how to proceed. (I believe responses are due in about 2 weeks)

               Thanks,

               Randy
