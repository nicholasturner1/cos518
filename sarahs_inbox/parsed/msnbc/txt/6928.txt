         This is a fabulous idea! I think if we shoot this from the perspective that

         the Governor has suggested (people's house - especially with teens in and

         out on a daily basis - should be alcohol free; Governor is setting the

         example for parents and families across the state to take a stand on this

         issues, etc), a video message of the alcohol being boxed up and removed can

         be used by many groups. It might even make the most sense to have it run as

         a PSA focused on prom and graduation safety issues for families. I'd hate

         to tie it to any one group, board, division, or department when it's an

         issue for all Alaskans.



         Great work, Governor!        Let me know how I can help.

        Erika - would have the Govs Mansion's alcohol that's in the liquor cabinet

        boxed up and removed from "the People's House" downstairs in the public

        dining area?       Here's my thinking: with so many kids and teens coming and

        going in that house, esp during this season of celebrationstt for young

        people - proms, graduations, etc, I want to send the msg that we can be -

        and "the People's House" needs to be - alcohol-free. There's a lot of booze

        there - its too accessible and may be too tempting to any number of all

                                                               1

         those teens coming and going.



         We need to send this sobriety msg. It can be sent via support from Native

         Sobriety Assns, M. A. D. D. , Healthcare Strategies Council, or whomever can

         also benefit from the vocal support that I can provide them through this

         action, then I'll do it.

         called me on their way to pick me up for flight to skagway - now the problem

         is the King Air has a flat tire so can't fly afterall. My family is all on

         the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the niceities without me this evening

         in Skagway and I'll still try to get there somehow tomorrow. what a

         continued zoo this is, trying to get from point A to point B - and i don't

         know why the flat tire wasn't discovered until a just now.



                    erika and ivy - I may be here afterall tonight.

                              Ch. 2, Joy Mapaye,   was wondering if you could call her for

         a quick interview. End of the session is here, how are things and with the

         arrests - is that too big of a distraction as the session ends? Her number

         is 762-9260. Please let me know if possible - I could also look for Irwin.

         Interview should either happen before 4:30 or after 6:00.
