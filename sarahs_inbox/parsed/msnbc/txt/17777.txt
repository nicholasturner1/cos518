         I still haven't heard back who wrote it. When I find out I"ll know.                    In the meantime I'm
         glad you emailed me about it

         Final point, I promise.  What I wanted to get out of this was a clearer picture of who to
         talk to in this situation. I don't know who would have had authority (and time) to get
         the proclamation changed. Who would you have wanted me to talk to?

        No, it doesn't sound like me - pls Let em know I didn't write it - no one showed it to me
        -  Kari reports it was the signature machine signing. But its water under the bridge now.

         Relevant portions:



         ,,it is not the intent of this proclamation to promote a particular religion , but rather to
         encourage thoughtful reflection on the condition of our state and country and to honor our
         freedom of religious expression whether that is prayer , alms giving , fasting, peace
         activism , meditation , promotion of social justice or another form of contemplative action.




         .. .I urge you to join fellow Americans across racial , political , and religious boundaries
         to observe the National Day of Prayer within your respective communities and faith
         traditions.




          " May we be thankful for our blessings , reflect on the many needs of our state and nation,
          treat our neighbors with dignity and respect , and seek moral and spiritual renewal through
          the religious or spiritual expression which most closely aligns with who we are as
          individuals.




         Now, therefore ... proclaim ... as National Day of Prayer in Alaska and encourage Alaskans to
         keep the health, well-being, prosperity, and peace of our state , nation and world in mind
         on this day."

        I don't know , it was delivered to my office - so I don't know who signed off on it . I134 It
        was in final form when I received it, so I thought that you had seen it.IL34 These are
        usually done by Michelle Fabrello , but it's been my experience that someone in the
        Governor ' s office signs off on it . IL34 I don't know anymore than that.

         ILM



         After the Governor ' s Prayer Breakfast , and your statements there (which I again heard much
         positive feedback on today from the pastors who were at the Day of Prayer gathering), the
         proclamation was almost embarrassing . Ii34 I am always honored to offer remarks on your
         behalf and I don't mean to sound ungrateful for the opportunity - but, you asked us to
         tell it to you straight and so, I ' m believing that you meant that.




         I held onto this email for about 30 minutes before sending it.Ig34 In that time , I was told
         the Valley pastors who gathered for National Day of Prayer did not read the proclamation
         because of the wording . I434 I guess that, s my confirmation that I should hit the send
         button.




         IL34




        Thanks for all that you do and I know you're working hard on other issues , but I have been
        a witness to what happens when a Governor is insulated from any criticism . Ie34 I believe
        you can be an incredibly successful Governor.
