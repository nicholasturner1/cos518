              Subject: Compass Piece submitted today
                        Kris,
                        I wanted to let you know that I submitted the attached Compass Piece to the ADN
                        today. I hope that print it as it is not only a rebuttal it will also help to educate our
                        residents in the Mat-Su about the shelter and its capabilities.
                        Thanks,
                        Dianne M. 1jtier
