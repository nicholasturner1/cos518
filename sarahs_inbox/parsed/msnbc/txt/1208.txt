MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin,

I wanted to take a moment to congratulate you on the birth of your second child! As the parent of a
beautiful 6 year old boy (born with Down syndrome)) wanted to welcome you on a wonderful journey.
I also appreciated the positive message you sent in your announcement.



All my best to you and your family!!



Sincerely,



Jeanette Cordova
