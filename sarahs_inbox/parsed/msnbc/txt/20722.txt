                Subject: Follow up 15 August question about regulation 75.003 and ADF&G actions.

              Dear Mr. Nelson and Commissioner Lloyd,

              Attached please find a follow up letter which questions the actions of ADF&G relative to emergency order 2-SS-2-
              26-2008. I have not heard back from anyone on this question, which I thought was fairly straight forward. I
              assumed you both received it.

              In any event, t feel there are serious and substantial questions about ADF&G use of emergency order authority
              that need answering. I would hope that you will respond to this inquiry in a timely manner.

              If there are corrections to existing regulations to improve management then they should be submitted . However,
              the Board Fisheries in regulation 5 AAC 75.003 was in my opinion, trying to balance the increased fishing
              opportunity question with escapement goal management and conservation.

              Therefore, ADF&G should be following the regulations and asking for changes where changes are appropriate.
              Since ADF&G submitted no request for change to 5 AAC 60. 170 ( Little Susitna River Coho Salmon Management
              Plan) they must have felt comfortable with the existing SEG goal. It would appear that ADF&G also felt that
              higher escapements than the SEG would and could take place and would further refine the goal to a BEG. If this
              was not the case then asking for higher bag and possession limits in the management plan would have been
              consistent with 5 AAC 75. 003.

              As a technical note, the emergency order 2-SS-2-26-2008 if legal, which I question, also should have modified the
              management plan 5 AAC 60.170 since the limitation on bag and possession limits was modified. The emergency
              order only references 5 AAC 60.120 which puts it in conflict with the management plan regulation.

              I look forward to your joint response to my questions in the attached letter. If you decide not to respond to the
              questions please inform me of that decision.

              Ken Tarbox.

                Subject: Clarification on regulation 5aac 75.003

                Dear Mr. Nelson,

               On Thursday, August 14, 2008 the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) issued Emergency Order 2-
               ss-2-26-08 which raised the bag and possession limit for coho salmon in the Little Susitna River from two to
               three.

                In the past I have questioned what authority ADF&G has to increase bag and possession limits when an

                                                                                                                         Page 2 of 2


                existing management plan does not contain the option for increasing said bag limits.

                Regulation 5 AAC 75. 003 states that an emergency order may not supersede bag and possession limits or
                methods and means established in regulatory management plans established by the Board of Fisheries.

                The above referenced emergency order does just that . Regulation 5 AAC 60. 170 Little Susitna River Coho
                Salmon Management Plan limits the bag and possession limit to two fish with no option stated in regulation to
                change it.

                Therefore, it appears that ADF&G has no authority to take such action via emergency order . They may,under
                my understanding, do so by emergency regulation.

                Further, at the Upper Cook Inlet Board of Fisheries meeting in February 2008 the ADF&G submitted proposal
                206 to allow them to alter bag and possession limits in the Kenai River sockeye salmon fishery and they noted
                in public testimony and via RC 2 that regulation 75.003 was limiting their emergency order authority . The Board
                of Fisheries agreed and altered the Kenai River sockeye salmon management plan to allow more flexibility
                relative to bag and possession limits in the Kenai River.

                Therefore, it appears ADF&G is fully aware of the limitations of 75.003 and yet they continue this season to not
                follow the regulation. I have questioned ADF&G directly numerous times where they may have been in
                violation of 75.003 and they cite they have talked with law about this and they are confident they have the legal
                authority to change bag and possession limits via emergency order authority. even with an existing
                management plan limits that authority.

               Of course that is in conflict with their own position at the Board of Fisheries meeting on Kenai River sockeye
               salmon.

               At this point I would like you or someone in the law department to respond in writing as to what authority ADF&G
               has in regulation or statue to override regulation 5 AAC 75. 003 relative to bag and possession limit alteration
               when an existing management plan prohibits such actions.

               I would also like to note I am not questioning the rationale for the emergency order at this time just the authority.

               Thank you for your time on this matter . I look forward to your response.
