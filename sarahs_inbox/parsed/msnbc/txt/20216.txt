              Don't know what else I'Il be missing in this, but we need to be prepared to take beat for findings
              in these Gov's Office travels as some of the TAs are obviously inconsistent and blundered:

             Right. But on these Frank did not travel w me. Bitney didn't either. So their TA arent associated
             w my travels though their TAs are attached to mine. (Frank's was not even on the same days as
             my travels were)

             Okay- if I recall one of the FOIA requested info when a staffer was on a flight with you regardless of the purpose. I
             will call this to Linda's attention in the a.m. before I talk with Kyle.

             There is a Bailey and a Bitney TA on top of the pile that you'll see tomorrow that have no revelance to my travels so .
             pis exclude. There are others that have no signature on them (like Ivy's and others), but I'm not worrying about them.
             There are some days with no explanation attached to the travel purposes also. And, there are missing TAs from the
             beginning of the term when the girls traveled with me, but I'm not going to worry about those either I guess.
               My understanding was to be included in the pile of TAs were trips involving the family, even the trips we paid for
             ourselves when the girls (and Track for at least one trip) traveled on our own dime, not the states... but I don't see
             any of those in this pile either.
               Submit them to ADN according to their deadline, but there needs to be further explanation on all this so they
             understand that there were additional travels we took as First Family that we paid for ourselves.

             Don't know why it won 't open.

             It is a laundry list of things he wants. Emails , files, correspondence , names and addresses of any and all
             staff that would have any knowledge of wait's firing. Logs, summaries, phone messages and on and on.
             He wants all this by Aug 13th. Again we have not laid out any game rules yet and he is setting timelines
             on us now. You got to be kidding me.....
