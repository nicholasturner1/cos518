            Just so everyone has the latest...



            The plan is now to put language into the capital budget tied to a small

            appropriation.     Rep. Coghill was not confident he could get a resolution

            through at this point.

            Sounds good that the legislative branch is taking the lead. Teamwork is

            a wonderful thing.

            Please let Rhonda and I know if we can do anything to assist .          I'd like

            to keep the Statehood Commission apprised of this also.



            Thanks

            Joule and Coghill will introduce resoultion to support changing state

            seal to incorporate Native illustration ... and they'll work on a task

            force to accomplish this with Talis being our designee to serve on the

            task force - they asked us to have a positive message about their

            efforts . This is all about respect , recognition, unity. It's all good.
