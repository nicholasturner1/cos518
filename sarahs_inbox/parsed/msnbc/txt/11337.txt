              Frank- if there's only a few days left to put names forward to leggies to fill b and c
              spots, do you want ivy to come help for a day or two? I haven't asked her yet, but knowing
              her (and Annette who'd be generous to help out by lending Ivy) she'd be willing. I'm
              guessing.



             Leggies aren 't going to give us any breaks , so the sooner we get names in front of them,
             the better. They'll be looking for reasons to ding us this session.



             This wk is packed with AML folks coming and going into my office, but I've tried to clear
             a big chunk of time to get b and c issues time to be addressed. Thanks
