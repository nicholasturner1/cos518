Subject:                Alliance chamber rdc


I attended the meeting all day in anch for the alliance/state chamber/rdc.

It was supposed to be for their boards only but I didn't know that and they

didn't have the         to ask me to leave. It was obviously a rigged

situation. I talked to wayne stevens, head of the state chamber and he said

they didn't meet afterward to take any action. However, RDC board did. I

called their exec director Jason Brune today and he said they didn't take

any action but would meet next week.



I am suggesting that you be prepared to respond to an announcement from them

and I don't think it would hurt to point out the obvious connection with

undue influence of the oil companies in their organizations. Something like

"it is really sad to see how the oil companies have compromised even our

trade associations to the point they are acting against the interests of

Alaskans and their own members."



You guys are doing a good job and I believe the votes will be there for the

bill. I mentioned it before but we will probably ask to amend the bill to

allow for a plan amendment that improves the proposal and also an amendment

that gives credit for having an agreement to process gas liquids in state.

I have attached the language to this email.
