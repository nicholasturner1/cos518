         Just got an invite to the Meyer for State SENATE Campaign Kick-Off Fundraiser on Wed Oct 3



         Lets see          That's Cowdery's district      oh, and the other Rep in the District is
         Samuel's



         Sounds like the die is cast and things are in motion               for Kevin to move up to the
         Senate



         Event sponsor's have a couple Alliance people' s names




                                                           2
