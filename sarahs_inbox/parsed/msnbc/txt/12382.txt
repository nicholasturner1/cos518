             Thanks. They must be behind.

             Dont think he's having a whole lotta fun so far... I wish this were more his cup of tea.



             I had a great meeting with McCain and a few other govs. Let me know if anyone hears from
             other campaign camps. Thanks.

            Todd asked the picture to be changed out a couple months ago. Beth did send a new
            professional photo and bio corrections to NGA, but it was never changed. She did again -

            Todd still needs his info (for things like NGA) to be updated. They're still using an old
            snowmachine picture of his- the other spouses have professional photos and updated bios.
