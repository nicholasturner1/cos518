           Governor, All,
           FYI. I just learned that Bill Walker, Port Authority, will also be attending the Williams meeting with the Governor in
           Michigan. It appears that Williams is considering partnering with the Port Authority on their AGIA application,
           although I do not think Williams has made a final decision to do so.
