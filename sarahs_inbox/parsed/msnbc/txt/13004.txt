           I'm sure Janice will get back to you, but she is the only person that has access to
           change. I don't, but would like to so that I can help you with this more. Also, I had
           previously asked - per your request - that you have access and I'll have to find out what
           happened with that.

           Janice - instead of me bugging you throughout weekends and evenings to add to                my
           officially posted schedule, who else has access to amending that calendar and                can assist?
           I am fine w doing it myself if someone will show me how. We're missing things                on the sched
           due to my lack of time to note and follow up on changes, due to our continual                problems
           with emails being received, etc. Thank you
