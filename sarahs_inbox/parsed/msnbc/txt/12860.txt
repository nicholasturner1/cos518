                Are we still looking for help in the media relations /communications area?

                Alyse came across a woman (who interviewed for a management job where Alyse is
                working) with an outstanding pedigree in that field. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                I've attached her resume. Let me know if you want Alyse to. have Privileged or P, submit
                something more formal.

                Hope this helps.
