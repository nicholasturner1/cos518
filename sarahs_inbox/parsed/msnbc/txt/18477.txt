        Governor - Security has purchased you a seat on tomorrow evening flight home. I will
        update your calendar and ask that they cancel Thursday afternoon flight. Janice

        Flts late, haven't left yet and sounds like it may be awhile.




        I can fly hm late tomorrow nite instead of thurs afternoon be we've got some thursday mtgs
        I can catch up on.




        Tib- criticism we're hearing at first blush on ACES is we didnt flesh it out before
        presenting. That surprised me, as we're being transparent with our thought processes and
        debate, thus we wanted to roll this out so Alaskans would know where we're headed come Oct
        18. Just fyi. Criticism was from Doogan, Crawford, talking heads on radio - but that's all
        I've heard so far in these parts. Some must have expected a bill to be rolled out today?
