       Besides a trip to Fairbanks on May 3 and Skagway on May 7, the Governor will be in Juneau
       the first couple weeks of May. UNLESS she could do the Denali event Friday, May 4 in
       Anchorage on her way back to Juneau, but we need to see when she wants to return to Juneau
       after Fairbanks.  Kari.

        Subject: Denali awards




       The winners of the Governor's Denali Awards have              been selected. These awards          recognize
       state employees for excellence in service to the              State of Alaska. Most of the         winners are
       from the Anchorage area. Will the Governor be in              Anchorage during the second          week of May?
       If the awards could be handed out then, it would              coincide with Public Service         Recognition
       Week.




       Thanks
