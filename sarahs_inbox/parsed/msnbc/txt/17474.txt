             Subject: thoughts on B&C

           What do you think about Privileg for the vacancy on the Mental Health Trust Authority? If you remember, the 6
           person panel sent one nomination that we weren't 100% on. I know we were thinking of Privi or the Health
           Council, but I thought MHTA might be another perfect place for her. Very high profile position for someone key.

           Also, what do you think about Privileged o for the vacancy on Royalty Oil and Gas? Its the seat vacated by
           Charlie Cole . He doesn 't want to be re-a ppointed. The other names that crossed my mind : Privile ed or Per
           (Stepovich thought he might be good ), Privileged (applied for PFD), privileged (applied for

           Third, I've been meeting with Tara Jollie re: AK Workforce Investment Board . She and Commissioner Bishop
           would like to start changing out that board in three rounds of 6 members . I have a meeting with Tib and Tara on
           Thursday to go over Labor's suggestions.

           The more I think about the Health Council , the more I think P rivileged or should be on there . What do you guys
           think?

           Thanks,
