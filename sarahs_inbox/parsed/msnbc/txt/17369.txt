        Subject:                  PERS TRS and JNU Empire story


        Governor:

        This story ran today in the JNU Empire, and I wanted to be sure you

        remembered from our conversation when you were signing the transmittal

        letters, some communities, like Wasilla, will pay more under the new

        plan, but they were going to pay more anyway.



        Our plan has a "hold harmless" provision for FY08 for all of the

        communities, like Wasilla, that would have paid more in the FY08 fiscal

        year.      Knowing the complaint that this is a hold harmless for one year

        and what about FY09, I looked at the difference between FY 07 and 08

        increases and have numbers that I intend to offer at the AML discussion

        tomorrow where the State would pay 75% of the increase in 09 (vs. 100%

        in 08); 50% in 10 and 25% in 11.



        Again, I'm tring to look at this holistically ,               to get the State and the

        local governments on a steady path to paying down the unfunded                  liability

        - not just looking at a short - term solution ,             as I believe the House

        Finance Committee ' s plan does.
