             Sounds like rebecca palsha will be their gal in Juneau during session. Could u make sure
             she gets an invite to Gov's House bbq on Wednesday, 5pm, we'll sign a couple of bills
             there at that time while we're welcoming lawmakers back for sp session. They'll be doing
             live 5, 6, and 10pm newscasts - they're welcome to do the live at the mansion that
             evening. Thanks
