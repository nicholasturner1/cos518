         MESSAGE:

        Dear Madame Governor: I am a high school student attending High Point Christian Academy in
        High Point, North Carolina. I also happen to be a political thinker and a history buff who
        is a right-winger, I'd like to thank you for your efforts to reform Alaska's political
        system. The world needs more like you, Governor Palin. I wish you were North Carolina's
        governor! Keep up the good work. I don't know if you've noticed, but you have made quite a
        stir in the party grassroots. Many are calling for a Rudy-Sarah ticket 08! Wouldn't that
        be great?rnrnrnAgain thanks and God bless,rnrnJoseph Winberry
