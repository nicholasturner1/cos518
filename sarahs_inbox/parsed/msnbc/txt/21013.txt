            Gosh, I was kind of feeling left out while Dan Fagan picked on you alone-but no more--I'm proud to stand with
            you while I, too, am personally vilified by Fagan.

            I've told my staff not to respond and I've got one person monitoring-having instructed everyone else to keep
            their heads down and keep doing their work-though their curiosity was killing them as they turned off their radio
            connections.

                                                Gupta offers several suggestions to the Indian Rotarians that we can also

                                               Dear Fellow Rotarians:

                                               The following information is from a press release issued by the
                                               International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
                                               Societies:

                                               "On Thursday , August 2 two strong underground tremors , registering 6.2 and
                                               5.9 on the Richter scale hit Sakhalin region in the far east of the Russian
                                               Federation .... The epicenters are situated near the west coast of Sakhalin
                                               Island ... Underground tremors were perceptible in the Nevelsky and
                                               Kholmsky districts of Sakhalin Oblast.

                                               ... According to official data , the heaviest damage occurred in the settlement
                                               of Nevelsk where around 25,000 people are currently living. Two people
                                               were killed and ten injured during the earthquake . Damage included
                                               structural damage to apartment buildings and facilities , as well as loss of
                                               power and water supplies in Nevelsk and several villages . The affected area
                                               is seven time zones from Moscow....



                                               Mari-Anne and I accompanied an inspection team of Rotarians
                                               from the Kholmsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Rotary Clubs.
                                               Aftershocks continue almost daily, rattling residents and
                                               endangering those involved in clearing and demolishing
                                               buildings. The government responded with tent and rail shelters,
                                               emergency supplies and a relocation /payment plan.. .

                                            The personal story which touched all of us was that of the
                                            mother of Assistant Governor Igor Grachev. She has lived in
                                            Nevelsk for many years, in a third floor apartment overlooking
                                           the picturesque water-front. Now she must leave and the
                                           options are not to her liking. She has enjoyed her independence
                                           and does not want to move in with any of her adult children, with
                                           their own families. And the government's compensation
                                           payment is not sufficient to buy a similar apartment. It seems
                                           that she and thousand of other unfortunate residents will have to
                                           leave Nevelsk. No one can say when, or if, replacement housing

                                           situations and circumstances that Rotarians can provide

                                           Rotarians that we share their feelings of loss, and we have the
                                           will, and the means, to assist them.
