            Governor,



            There are 8 little gift bags in my office; they have a sm. candle , potpourri and a choc.
            truffle in them.   A larger bag is there too if you want something to put them in.



            There's an inventory list on the freezer let me know if you need anything packed up to
            take with you. The quaill definitely needs to find a new home and get used real soon. :)



            Thanks,

            Erika
