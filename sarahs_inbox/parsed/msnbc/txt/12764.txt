            I talked with Sean Cockerham today regarding Randy Reidrich . He wanted to know what your
            relationship was w / him. I told him there was no relationship - 1 also told him that you
            favored a change in leadership.



            He would like to ask you more questions. I told him you had a full day and didn ' t promise
            anything . But just in case 2574344 . Thanks
