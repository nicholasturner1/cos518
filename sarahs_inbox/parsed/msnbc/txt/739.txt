  Increased oil profits tax benefits Alaskans , won't drive out drillers

  I feel compelled to laud Gov. Sarah Palin and our legislators. Despite what some want us to believe, the
  oil companies are not going anywhere. It will take much more than a 25 percent profits tax and a couple
  of extra concessions to scare companies from our state. Their ads are right. We have a long-standing
  relationship with the oil industry. What happened as a result of the special session won't jeopardize that.

  Oil company officials have had to grovel with President Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Many have worked
  with corrupt and unstable governments in Africa. Corporations continue to build massive infrastructure,
  elaborate security systems and miles of transportation grid in remote places. Many of these places are
  harder to reach than the North Slope. None offer the hardest-working and most innovative work force in
  the world.

  There are safer places for oil companies to do business. In Norway oil firms pay a corporate tax of 28
  percent and a special tax of 50 percent on oil profits.

  Whether or not a few not-so-bright legislators sold their votes for pennies on the dollar last year, a new oil
  tax structure and a better deal for Alaskans makes sense today . We owe the governor and the Legislature
  big thanks . They had the foresight and courage to make history.
