          The Governor was just on Bloomberg TV, live feed at ipm today. Needless to say SHE
          KILLED ! She was slated to have 7 minutes to talk about taxes, AGIA and corruption. They
          had her stay through the break for an extra 5 minutes .  Bruce and I watched it online in
          my office . She was on message and socked a HOME RUN!!! Bruce and I were going nuts, high
          fiving and fist pumping , it was surreal . She did a great job for this state today!

         shortly.  Amazing job , amazing Governor.
