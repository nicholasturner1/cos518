             Perhaps Mr/Ms. Burgess might feel differently if they knew that (according to McHugh Pierre of
             the DMVA) 20% of our veterans reside in the Valley?

             Was Palin 's military appreciation picnic another Wasilla promo?
            This is about the governor's Military Appreciation Picnic held 4-8 p.m. Friday at the Wasilla
            Iditapark.
            Once again our governor is spotlighting Wasilla by having the military appreciation event not
            where the military live and work, but clear out in Wasilla on a Friday evening when most were
            still working. By the time they got off work it's still at least an hour's drive. Was this truly an
            appreciation of our military or another opportunity to focus on Wasilla?
