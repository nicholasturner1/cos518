  Subject : GUEST LIST QUESTION- Friends of the Governor's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser, May 9th, 2007 at
            the Residence
  Hello Governor and Mr. Palin,

  The list of lobbyists for the Friends of the Governor's Mar, siop Foundation Fundraiser are listed below for
  your review/approval. I've also attached the 2007 Lobbyist Directory in case you wanted the
  client/employer information. Please let me know if you'd like to make any changes or have any additional
  guests that you'd like to include.

 F.Y.I. - The Foundation pays for the food, beverage, and staff over time expenses, so that it's not an
 expense that the House incurs. I have a copy of a memorandum from the Department of Law from March
 14, 2005 where the question was asked if there would be any Executive Ethics Act (AS 39.52) or
 other legal concerns presented if the foundation held a fundraiser at the Governor 's Mansion and
 the conclusion (was that the First Lady ( Gentleman in this case) is not a " public official " under the
 Ethics Act, the strictures of the Act do not apply to her /him. The Governor may also host
 fundraising activities at the residence , and he may freely invite guests and host functions as
 he/she deems proper . Of course, there is much more information, and this is paraphrased, but I wanted
 you to be aware of some of the issues that have been addressed. I could fax a copy to you if you'd like.

  If at all possible, it would be great to have the final guest list as soon as possible, as May 9th is quickly
  approaching.

 Thank you,
 Erika
