          Whatever you want to do is fine with me. I have an ALMR.Executive

          Council meeting that I would be doing by teleconference from 1:30 - 3pm

          here in JNU. However, if you want me to be in ANC for a background

          thing, I would then just attend this meeting in person in ANC, as well.

          Let me know. Plane is full tomorrow morning.

          It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the DPS

          budget and contract results... especially in light of.how hard you all

          worked to increase funds and provide tools that DPS claimed they needed

          to do their job. Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have been

          overlooked by some.

            There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union",

          and this is unfair to you, to the whole administration , and most

          importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth. Please share

          your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on your work

          product and our committment to public safety can be countered with the

          truth. Thank you
