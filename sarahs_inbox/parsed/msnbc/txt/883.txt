Hi Todd,



Just a few things:



I left the drafts for the foundation thank you letters on the copier. If you have time could you see if
there's any changes you'd like to make; then I can print them off for you to sign tomorrow.



Linda would like to meet with you for 15 minutes- is that a possibility? She can meet at the House,
her office or where ever it's convenient.



Sometime tomorrow I have just a couple of things to ask you about-let me know if/when you have a
minute.



Thanks,

Erika
