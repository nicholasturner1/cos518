   Subject: Bridge Builders

 FYI, Elsa Sargento (formerly of the Alaska State Community Service Commission) is the President of Bridge
 Builders and Angelina Burney (from Commerce) is the Vice President. From what I learned today, you will be
 sitting at Elsa's table. Also, Reverend Patterson from Shiloh will be performing the Invocation. He is sitting with
 Malcolm Roberts.

 Janice told me that she spoke w/you and it is not necessary that I staff tomorrow evening's event. I did want to let
 you know that I (and Clark) will be there, although at a different table. Pastor Thomas Davis invited us to attend.

 This afternoon Sharon gave me a copy of the event overview and speech for you. I'll drop off at your house
 tomorrow early afternoon.

 Also, I will not be in the office on Monday. Tibbles is aware. I will be back in the office Tuesday afternoon. While
 out, I'll be connected via phone and email.

 Thanks,
 Kris
