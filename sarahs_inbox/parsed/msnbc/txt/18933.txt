          That is good, and unfortunately the media will sensationalize on any opportunity they
          receive.

          I certainly didn't hear anything from Michael Burns when we spoke with him about Blunck's
          appointment, don't believe Dan did either or he would have mentioned it to me. Not to say
          it wasn't planned for this week, but the Ear was the first I heard of it as well.
