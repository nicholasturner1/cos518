             Regarding the Congressional delegation and Lisa Murkowski, we followed the
             roll-out plan. Within minutes of the press release, we contacted the
             delegation through their transportation staffers with the expectation that they
             would advise their principals. This is the normal way we have been
             communicating with the delegation on the bridges.

             The DC portion of the roll-out plan grew out of discussions with Juneau. Privileg
