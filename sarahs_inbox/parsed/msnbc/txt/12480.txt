            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin-




            I am in Washington to cover the Exxon oral arguments before the Supreme Court for the
            Anchorage Press. I will be in the press section of the courtroom tomorrow (Wednesday)
            morning. I am also a plaintiff in the case- my family and I have fished salmon at our
            setnet sites on Kodiak since 1983.



            I realize you are quite busy and this is very late notice, but I was wondering if you
            would have a few minutes to talk about the Exxon case while you are in Washington. I did
            not realize until last night that you would be in Washington this week or I would have
            tried to set this up sooner.



            I am the reporter from Kodiak who wrote a piece for the Press last spring about my time in
            Iraq as an embedded reporter with the Marines. You sent me a very gracious letter about
            the piece, which I much appreciated. It's always nice to get fan mail. My son and I also
            met you in Kodiak for your inauguration party last year, though there were a lot of people
            there and I wouldn't expect you to remember us.



            Thank you for considering my request,




                                                                  1
