             The Coast Guard is suspending search efforts .      They will follow up on

             new information , as it comes in, and they are encouraging all pilots

             in the area to remain vigilent in looking for evidence of a crash site.

             The search has been extensive , and thorough .     All survival scenarios

             have been explored , and realistically ruled out .      Most likely, they

             went down on a forested hillside ,   invisible from the air, and

             extremely remote from the ground.

             We remain hopeful that they will be found someday to bring closure for

             their family and friends.

             For us at DOR, we remember Brian as a good friend , an exceptional

             collegue , and just fun to be around . He will be greatly missed.

             Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.



             Jerry Burnett will be serving as acting Deputy Commissioner.
