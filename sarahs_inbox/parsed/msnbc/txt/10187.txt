              Sorry for the late email, but in looking at the speech and agenda Beth sent for AEA, I
              noticed that the speech says 8:30 a.m. and the agenda shows you giving the opening address
              at 8:20 a.m. I will be there about 8:00 a.m. to scope things out and see if anything is
              needed.  Just wanted you to have a heads up.
