          Subject:                 Cabinet Dinner


          K- has anyone in the Anchorage office gotten closer to details on a cabinet dinner to
          supplement a cabinet meeting? We can organize it from the Juneau end if need be- we should
          do this sooner rather than later and it can be delegated to Tara or even Patricia or
          whomever has good organizing skills, but has more time to schedule it than you or others
          would have right now.

             Another thought if Anchorage locale seems unlikely is for me to get cabinet down to
          Juneau while I'm there this week and I host a dinner for them there.

             Just checking to see if anyone went anywhere with it the past two weeks be it can
          easily be handled from the Juneau also, realizing how slammed the Anchorage office has
          been (Anna would be great help from that end too.)
