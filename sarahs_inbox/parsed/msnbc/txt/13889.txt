            I was told at least two did not vote for him . When she told me it was unanimous I said I
            was "surprised " or "shocked ", and since I did not know him I was questioning this because
            the candidate had to fit in the cabinet , represent the new energy , progress , etc that we
            needed.



            She turned to Barb and asked what everyone should do next because they were ready to gavel
            out and hop on the plane ... Barb explained Esther could explain this to the board, then
            they gavel out, then make plans to reconvene . Esther said they would also contact their
            attorney. Esther indicated this isn ' t the way things are normally done , I explained we're
            not doing things as most Gov ' s have done ... I tried to be light hearted about it but was
            so caught off guard with the " it was unanimous" comment - and she handed me a handwritten
            note with his attributes listed , included " feels he can work with the Governor". Feels?



           Amyway , we'll go from here.

            That is what you indicated she said - that it WAS unanimous.

             Is it possible to poll this board?

             I've never encountered anything like this before.

            Just heard that the vote for John wasn ' t unanimous - at least two did not vote for him.
           Didn't Ester just say it was unanimous?
