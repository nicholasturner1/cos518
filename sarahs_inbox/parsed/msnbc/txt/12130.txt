              Governor-



              The London Times has an interesting question to pose to you-



              "Why would the governor of Alaska , with her reputation for political smarts and
              independence , risk her 85% approval ratings fighting against the registration of polar
              bears as an endangered species - when all indicators are it will happen sooner or later?"
              I suppose supplementary questions include what practical steps will she take to maintain
              her position - more DC lobbying ? - and what would it cost Alaska if the bears are
              protected over the next few weeks or months?



              They would like 10 minutes with you this afternoon. Thoughts? (They have a huge
              circulation)
