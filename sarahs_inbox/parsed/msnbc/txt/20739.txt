              Dear Governor Palin,

              We have heard of your daughter's current situation and would love to provide her with one of our
              wedding dresses for her wedding for free. We realize this is a personal matter, but we have many
              customers in the same situation. Because many women find it difficult to find a dress designed for their
              growing shapes, we have been able to provide them with beautiful gowns for their special day. Our
              custom gowns can be cut to her exact measurements if she desires one of those.

             Here is the link to our site with all the options for gowns that we
             manufacture. http://www.nicolematernitywholesale.com/items/matemity-wedding-dresses/list.htm?1=1



             Best Regards,
