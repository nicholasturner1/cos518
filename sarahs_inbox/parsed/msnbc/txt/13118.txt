           Subject: Mat-Su Miners




           I spoke to Marty Metiva who is the President of the Board for Mat-Su Miners. He told me
           that they - the Board of Directors - do not support the $200k request that is in the
           supplemental budget.   He wrote a letter to that effect to Senator Green last night. I
           expect a copy. He said that certainly they would appreciate funding but $200k is
           exorbitant; $50k would be more in-line. He further stated that the board unanimously
           voted on this and any request to the contrary wasn't authorized. His comment, which I
           appreciated, is they only touch about 4,000 people which isn't worth $200k...
