         I met w/him too while I was in Juneau & he said he wanted to meet /talk w/me weekly on
         int'l trade... obviously that's not possible. He also serves on statehood commission.

         Governor,




         Rep. Neumann called today in a rather frustrated state. Rep. Neumann believes that parents
         of correspondence school courses ought to have more flexibility with money appropriated
         for non-core courses. When he asked Commissioner Sampson whether he would do this via
         regulation, the commissioner apparently suggested that Rep. Neumann do it via legislative
         change-when the changes were made in regulation to begin with. (What bothered him is that
         Rep. Neumann says he was led to believe by Richard Mauer (?) that the changes would be on
         the Board of Education's agenda for its June meeting but apparently they have backed away
         from it.  I asked him to provide a written proposal for change and he promised to do so. I
         will pass this along to you if he responds.




        Also, on another note, I asked him whether he had spoken with you on the topic. He said he
        set up multiple appointments and could never get in due to schedule changes. He said he
        complained to Bitney about it, asking him whether you were trying to send him a message
         (He said, "Did I do something to make the governor mad?") and John allegedly just said
         "No" that you were busy. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
