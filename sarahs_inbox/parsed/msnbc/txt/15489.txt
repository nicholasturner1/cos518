             I'll let Scheduling answer be it looks like at least one other thing will be added to
            sched during the time you're suggesting for bill signing tomorrow...

             Governor,




            I'd like to check with you about approving a 15 minute slot, tomorrow, Tuesday (Janice
           and Kris discussed the time frame) at about 2:30pm to invite Senator Bill Wielechowski to
           the Anchorage office to sign SB 185 (sex offender/registration) which is due Wednesday,
           May 28th.
                                                             2




                                                                                                         PRA GSP01_0018282

            Sen Wielechowski only has 2 bills this year and the other is SB 202 (REAL ID ), which will
           most likely become law without signature.



            If this is okay, I'd like to email an invitation to the Senator this afternoon to see if
           his schedule can accommodate the time.



             Thanks for the consideration.



             Kelly
