              No problem... I'm having difficulty thinking of newbies to the system with the competence
              and collaborative ability required--probably only a person like Privileged or Personal Matl
              could offer an experienced view of the available labor pool- Ir.jyileoed or Person (I think
              it's hard to make that leap from an anchor or even reporter position because you're likely
              forever tainted with having "lost journalistic objectivity" having once entered the world
              of politics.)

              Ok, thanks. How would you feel about names like

                Fyi- we just stole one from him- for rural affairs assistant : rhonda mcBride. But its
               very confidential until after AFN.
