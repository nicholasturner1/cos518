              This past year we have witnessed significant changes in infrastructure planning , national preparedness , infrastructure
                protection, national security, incident response, and disaster recovery . The National Response plan became the
                National Response Framework and the National Incident Management System was significantly upgraded. The
               National Infrastructure Protection Plan has significantly defined and outlined guidance for enhanced security in all
              sectors. Further guidance has been directed by the OSHA Emergency Response standard and "all hazards response"
                   is emphasized in all areas of preparedness. Homeland Security and PHMSA has sharpened focused on upon
                  HAZMAT security, shipping, handling, and storage of dangerous goods. The threat of pandemic disease has
               stimulated increased needs for preparedness in the Food , Agricultural , and Human Health Sectors. We all have been
                called to strengthen our national critidal infrastructures and key resources. In keeping pace with current trends, the
                 Office of Infrastructure Preparedness has implemented major enhancements for 2008 Infrastructure Preparedness
                Training Programs. In this regard, beginning in 2008 two extremely valuable new courses of study for professional
               enhancement training , will be available to you : (1) Emergency and Security Professional [ESPI® and (2) Safety,
                                               Environmental, and Emergency Manager [SEMI®.
                       Plan now to strengthen your career, and our national critical infrastructures and key resources.
