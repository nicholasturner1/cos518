          But I can get to Juneau whenever I need to, correct? Not necessarily friday-sunday? And
          I'd only bring one child to help me, make sure linda knows that so no one thinks its a
          whole first family affair.

              And how long is that ferry ride to sitka? Any options besides all day spent in Sitka?

          Governor - The deactiviation/activitation ceremony is from 1:30 to 2:30

          p.m. (1 hour). It is very short as they are deactivating a unit and

          then the same folks are being activated to different squad.



          I have checked with Linda P. and due to the state closing the house for

          the 3 months we would pay for you and family members to come to JNU to

          collect clothes, etc. at this time.



          You could come ANC/JNU Friday, 08.15.08 and then depart JNU/ANC on

          Sunday, 08.17.08,



          Flights into Sitka from JNU on Saturday,            08.16.08.

          Flt. #62 JNU/SIT 10:27 a.m. - 11:11 a.m.

          Flt., #67 SIT/JNU 7:12 p.m. - 7:54 p.m.



          The Event begins with Ferry Rides out to the Fort Rousseau State

          Historical Park at 9:00 a.m. with the Ribbon cutting from 1:00 - 2:00


                                                                  1

          p.m.    The last boat ride coming back to Sitka is at 4:00 p.m .        This is

          an Allen Marine Tour Boat that will be going back and forth.

          J-pls find out how long that deactivation ceremony is today. Also, for

          sched pis note I'll be meeting with some Fish and Game folks up here-

          I'll let you know when exactly for the TA and schedule.

              Also ,   I could look at the Sitka ceremony on Saturday if it works out

          for me to get to Juneau at the end of the week to help Erika close down

          the house for the three months ... We'll need to get our clothes out of

          there and other things the First Family will need over the next quarter.

          Pls ask Linda P., or whomever , if it's ok to bring one ofd the kids with

          me to help me pack up their clothes and items before Erika puts

          everything in storage or under visquene for the coming months.
