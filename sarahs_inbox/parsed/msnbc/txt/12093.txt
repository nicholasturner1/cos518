            Subject:                 RE: Budget


            Governor - I will bring over the supplemental requests when we meet at 3 PM - I don't
            think there is anything inconsistent with what we discussed in prep for the December
            budget release and we have tried to be consistent with treatment of items/increases in
            FY2009.



            Basically, we have a $257 million total fund supplemental request. $205 million of that
            is General Fund - BIG pieces of the general fund are $125 million for tax credits; $18.5
            million for senior benefits; $13.5 million for the GGU bargaining unit agreements; $17.1
            million for DHSS (proshare disallowance); OPA/PD we discussed earlier today at $3.1
            million for both; Corrections $4.7 million for overtime/inmate health care; Public Safety
            $3.7 million for troopers/vehicle/fuel costs (we have over $7.5 million for fuel costs in
            DOTPF, University, DPS)-



            We have also added funding for Climate Change - for the work DEC is doing at the chair of
            the subcabinet to bring back recommendations to you - $220.0 and DCCED - $1.1 million -
            to work with the 4 imminently threatened communities on coastal erosion and the
            coordination of efforts among all state and federal agencies to address their needs -



           Non-GF is the Ocean Rangers program $2.8 million in the cruise ship fees collected per
           berth - total of the program is $4 million - the department believes they can implement a
           program that meets the intent of the initiative without requesting an additional $1
           million in GF -



           There are a lot of details, but I think these are the highlights - and, I certainly hope
           there are no surprises!  Karen

            I'm really concerned about any surprises being requested by Admin in the supplemental. I
            keep hearing about items and increases that I've supposedly supported and brought forth to
            legislators. ANYTHING that will jump out as a surprise that I'm not in a position to
            defend, pls let me know about asap.
