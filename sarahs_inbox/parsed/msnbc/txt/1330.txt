We have a couple ideas about what the announcement might be. We are drafting responses so we
can be ahead of the curve. As soon as we hear for certain we will get with Rosanne and help where
we can. Tom

If press needs to grab me for statement on whatever Bowles is announcing today they can catch me
at Sheraton - noon - Nurses Appreciation function. Or after that at Click's DOL graduation thing in
Palmer. Or spring concert tonight in the Valley.



And pis let me know what they announced.
