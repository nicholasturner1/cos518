         SP and Talis: Just fyi- Halcro and VanTreek are on a tear to tear us up about MatMaid. I'm
         expecting our Ag Bd members to be out front on any new developments instead of putting us
         in a reactionary mode against Halcro's misinformation he's going to spew (from what I've
         heard).



        Mike- as soon as possible they'll need to provide a MatMaid update - should be after their
        mtgs this week.

        What is the blog chatter stating MatMaid has a new ceo making more than vanTrk, etc. ?



        Kris- did you forward emails to kristan last night so she'll be ready to respond to
        vantrk/halcro attacks? It's impossible to un_ring the bell, if he's out there spreading
        misinformation it's tough to be in a reactionary mode to correct.



        Pls also make sure Franci has info...



        Mike- where is Tom (and other DNR folks) on MatMaid issues as of late?

         How will the truthful and transparent message of Kristan's get to the public before AH and
         vanTrk get their bs message out there?

        Just got off the phone with Kristan. It was at the creamery meeting on Saturday that the
        Board learned of the July losses. They were anticipating another good month, however with
        attorney fees , overtime, a ruined batch of milk, and the increased cost of outside milk
        (43% increase since June) that did not occur. She said that Halcro had the information
        before the Board, most of which she says is inaccurate. She met w/attorneys on Saturday
        and I can provide additional information on that tomorrow.



        She said they have cut a million dollars and they have worked so hard in trying to find
        solutions, but one thing they don't have any control of, or can 't fix, is the cost of
        outside milk.  And, the fixed costs are the same whether we're producing through the plant
        or buying outside.




        Tomorrow morning is the Board of Ag meeting .    Following they will call an emergency meeting
                                                        2

         of the Creamery Board where they will take action on raising prices, changing terms of
         agreements , contacting a CPA firm that specializes in creameries to perform an audit, and
         discussing the future of M.
