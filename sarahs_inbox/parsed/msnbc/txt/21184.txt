          Governor -



         Hope your NY adventure went well and you ' re travels home are uneventful.



         FYI, I ' ll be at the Aces game tonight and will have my cell Privileged or(, so feel free to
         call if you make it to the game and can't find me in the crowd ( which appears to be a big
         one!).




         Also, at tomorrow ' s leadership team meeting we will break for lunch from 1 - 1:30 so
         invite you to join us for lunch as you get to meet the crew .   There will be about 17 of us
         there - deputy commissioners , assistant commissioners ( one who will retire in Jan.),
         division directors , and special assistants.



         I'm also looking forward to sitting down with you in the near future to brief you on H&SS
         issues.



         Thanks for all your hard work on behalf of Alaskans!



         Karleen
