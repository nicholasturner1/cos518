           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,



           Congratulations on the birth of your son! 19 years ago, my wife Elizabeth and I welcomed
           our first born, Steve, Jr. to the world. Like Trig, "Stevo" has Downs.



           I'm sure you have been swamped with love, well-wishes , and even many well intended but
           unhelpful cliches.



           What I most want to say to you is "Congratulations!" In Trig, you have so much joy, so
           much fun, so many incredible blessings in store for you that other parents simply cannot
           begin to imagine. And, (I say this a parent and a Presbyterian Minister) Trig is going to
           teach you so many blessed lessons about the love of God.



           Congratulations!      What a great blessing you have been given.



           In Christ,



           Rev. Steven S. Bryant

                                                                I
