            In biology we are doing the caring for the kenai projects, and i am researching what to do
            in case of a tsunami. I haven't really ever learned about what to do. i can't find very
            helpful sites either. Do you know where we should go incase of an emergency? How far
            inland do we drive? in kenai is there a specific place we should go? Growing up on the
            kenai peninsula i know that there is not many people know about what to do, and we need to
            know! thank you.
