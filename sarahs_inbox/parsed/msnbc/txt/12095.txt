                 Subject: skateboard park - Wasilla

               Governor-

               Michael Burns with Blambo Entertainment has been pursuing an interview with you for about a year
               now. He is filming a documentary about the Wasilla skateboard park that was constructed when
               you were mayor. He is a very nice guy - seems like a young guy. He mentioned he met you
               recently.

               He wanted to interview you next time you are in Wasilla - I told him that is next to impossible with
               the session gong on. He said he Is willing to travel to Juneau . Are remotely interested in filming
               this?
