                FYI, Spoke to Tom Lamal from Fairbanks this morning. He said he put in a resume during the transition and is
                interested in serving this administration. Ivy, do you have that? Doesn't sound like he put in for a particular
                position but mentioned his experience in commercial fishing and construction, and that he has interest in land
                use.
