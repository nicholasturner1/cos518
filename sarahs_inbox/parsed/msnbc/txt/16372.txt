                  Governor,

                  You will soon be taping a video for the opening of the Miss Alaska (America) pageant (the pageant will take place
                  July 19 in Anchorage). Bonnie Faulk has requested that the picture of you as Miss Wasilla appear during the
                  opening video; she feels it will be very encouraging to the girls and solidify the message that they can accomplish
                  anything they put their minds to. Please let me know if you are comfortable with the photo appearing in the video
                  (Jason and Andy would manage it, so it would not be released to the pageant itself but would be contained in the
                  video).

                  I.will wait for your approval before contacting your sister, Molly, for the photo (your mother's suggestion) - thank
                  you!

                  Dear Frank,

                 Please extend my sincere thanks to Governor Palin for reappointing me to the Alaska State Council on the Arts.
                 It is a true honor to serve the people of Alaska in this endeavor and I am thrilled to be able to continue to
                 support the "creative economy " of the state that I love so much . In challenging times, it is through our creative
                 endeavors that all things seem more achievable . Thank you for the phone call to let me know .... I know you're
                 very busy and I appreciate the connection . Thank you so much for supporting my reappointment.

                  My best,

                  Nancy Harbour
