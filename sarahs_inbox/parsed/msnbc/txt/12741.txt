             Well we're rooting for your daughter... and I'm so sorry you're not down there. Glad Pops
             got to go. See you Monday-ish, after this Fairbanks trip I'm on. Thanks

             Wow governor - thanks for this email! I was sitting with the mikes and Russ when we got
             the news they had won this game. My husband is down there and I am so glad he got to go.
             Anyway they will have their work cut out for them in the championship game tomorrow.



              And congratulations on your newest arrival! I don't know how you manage but I tell
             people you have more energy than anyone I know!



              Thanks for this. It means a lot! KJR

             Holy Moly Karen! You raised an amazing one! Congratulations on Mary's winning shot -
            absolutely awesome to read the account of their OT win. When she gets back to Juneau I'll
            bribe her to teach Willow a thing or two about hitting the money shot.
