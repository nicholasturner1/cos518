              FYI-i am meeting with a lawyer from Dept of Justice today in Juneau re Elections issues. I
              am working to comply with their desire to have six different Native tongues available on
              the touch screen voting machines . We already provide language assistance in certain
              precincts, but we don't have audio recordings available on the touchscreens in the Native
              dialects. Justice threatened to sue over it before picking up the phone to tell us they
              thought we had a problem. Seems like a suit happy time of year for folks.
