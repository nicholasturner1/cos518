MESSAGE:

Govenor Sarah Palin, Todd, Track, Bristol , Willow and Piper,



Congrats on the birth of your son/brother, Trig! We will be keeping all of you in our prayers! We do
not know what struggles you are facing, but your positive outlook will provide a beautiful environment
in which he will thrive!



Our fifth child, Michael Theo was born 17 months ago with a congential heart abnormality and Down
Syndrome. He is such an amazing joy to each one of us! I believe that God placed Michael with us
not because we are a great family, but to make us a great family .... we are truly a work in progress!



May God continue to give you the grace you need to enjoy each new day. Hope you are recoving
well after Trig's birth.


                                                   1                              ROSTON 02069
