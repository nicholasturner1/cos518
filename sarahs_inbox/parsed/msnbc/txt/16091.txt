           Hi Governor

            I wanted to share with you that I've been speaking with Susan Hernandez who's husband was
           killed in combat and who is the motivation behind the bill to give property tax relief to
           widows. She was beyond words when I told her about the bill signing and when finally able
           to speak said this bill now means she and her young children can remain in their home.

             I'm excited for you to meet her tomorrow.

             I think this is one of the nice things about our jobs, don't you?

            Mindy
