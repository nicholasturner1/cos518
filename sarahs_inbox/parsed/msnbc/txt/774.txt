Sarah/John/Todd,




I know there's a million people breathing down your necks for just about everything, but I wanted to
share these photos of myself and family on the trapline and out in the winter.

This is why the promotion of fur by our first woman govenor is so very important. I have a North Face
sleeping bag and backpack, but I wouldn't trade my fur hat or beaver mittens for anything! If I had,
I'm sure I would be down a few fingers by now.




I can make a beautiful fox headband that would look gorgeous on Sarah!




(hint, Todd, Christmas...)




Happy Holidays,



Becky Kelleyhouse



ps - photos are from Glennallen area, Klutina Lake and Denali Highway country
