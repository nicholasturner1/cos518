           He has indeed, Governor. We all have had FOX News on nonstop and have been hearing him.
           He's a great addition to the team. We are all so very proud of you, Governor. We miss you!

                          Dear Fellow Educator,

                         Studies show that having effective teachers and site administrators can dramatically close
                         the achievement gap between socioeconomically disadvantaged students and their more
                         affluent counterparts.

                         With this fact in mind, RAPSA has planned one comprehensive professional
                         development event that addresses the whole school - students, teachers,
                         administrators - and builds school success from the ground up.

                         I want to invite you to take action for your at-risk students by registering yourself
                         and your colleagues for the newly combined Reaching At-Promise Students National
                         Conference and Leaders Institute.

                         It's twice the information, twice the creative planning time, and twice the fun...
                         for one great value!

                         We can't wait to show you all the experts and proven strategies for content areas,
                         leadership, classroom management, community involvement, and more. With all
                         that we offer, this RAPSA conference will be the only one you need.

                         Register now for the Reaching At-Promise Students National Conference and Leaders
                         Institute, February 20-22, 2009! For more information, call us at 800.871.7482.

              Dear Governor Sarah Palin,

              Governor Palin My name is Brian Nelson . My Dad lives in Whittier. I spend every summer with him.
              This summer I worked at the restaurant at Portage Glacier . I am a 17-year-old senior at Pueblo West
              high School . in Pueblo West, Colorado . It is my dream to fly helicopters . I am talking with an Army
              recruiter to go from high school to Army flight school . The recruiter said I need some reference letters
              from influential people to make this dream come true . You were the first person that came to mind. A
              reference letter from you would make my dream come true.

              A little about me: My ASVAB score was a 92. I carry between a 3.8 and 3.9 GPA while taking
              accelerated classes at my high school . I bench 205 lbs and squat 245 lbs. I drive a 1992 Ford F-250,
              because it was all I could afford. I have never been in any kind of trouble with the law or at school. My
              parents call me low maintenance . My dad was in the Coast Guard for twelve years and my step-dad
              was Army for sixteen years. My passion is to fly helicopters, and I want to serve my country as my dads
              did. I need a reference letter from you to have this dream come true.

              When I told people, I was sending you a request for a reference letter a lot of them told me you would
              not even respond . My stepdad always told me, God determines what is possible and any dream can
              come true in America . The truth is a letter from you would pave the way to me appearing before the
              warrant officer enlistment board . Please write me a reference letter to be a flight warrant officer in
              the Army so I can realize my dream . I promise you to serve my country with pride and honor. Thank
              you for your help in living my dream.

             This letter is coming to you in e-mail because it is the most cost effective means; also, my recruiter said
             that time is of the essence. The e-mail format is the quickest way I know. Besides texting , but that
