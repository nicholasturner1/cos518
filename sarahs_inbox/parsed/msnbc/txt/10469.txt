              Thank you !     And I would say this is due to the great work of the DC Office personnel.

              Subject : Anti - Alaska Riders




              I am pleased to report that none of the anti-Alaska policy riders = described below and in
              my memorandum of October 9th has apparently been = included in the omnibus appropriations
              bill currently under considerat = ion by Congress.



              I would like to say that the absence of these riders is due to the = efforts of your DC
              office.  Hopefully, our advocacy was a = factor.  However, full disclosure compels me to
              say that the biggest = factors were the anti-rider stance of the Bush administration and
              the = procedural situation in Congress which made it difficult to include riders = in the
              omnibus bill.



              The riders    ( or threats of riders ) would have -



              * Required that Alaska return federal highway funds for the Gravina                      = Island and Knik Arm
              Bridges=20

              * Restricted oil and gas leasing in NPR - A and North Aleutian Basin=20

              * Prohibited the use of federal funds to build new roads in the = roadless areas of the
              Tongass National Forest , thereby sharply restricting = timber harvest. =20

              * Restricted Alaska's wolf management program=20

                                                                        1




                                                                                                                      PRA GSP01_0008673

              * Limited claims of access under RS2477=20

              * Prohibited the importation of polar bear parts from Canada , = thereby jeopardizing polar
              bear management in Northern Canada.



              Other anti - Alaska initiatives , such as additional wilderness in the = Tongass and the
              Coastal Plain of ANWR , never came up in the appropriations = process .   However; with a new
              President and Congress , we can = expect these to reemerge in the future.



              P.S.

              in a later spreadsheet , we will report on the fate of the State's = various appropriations
              requests and also other funding for Alaska. =
