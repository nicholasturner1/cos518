              I am not a citizen of Alaska, but have read about your work to get rid of

              corruption in state government. Please keep up the fine work. Your are a

              shining light in today's political world. You give us hope for the future

              of the country. I hope you run for president in 2012 on a ticket with

              Bobby Jindal . You would have my vote.



              May God Bless you and your family.
