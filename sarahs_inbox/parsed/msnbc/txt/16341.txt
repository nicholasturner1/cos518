             Tell DPS that this is really outrageous. We're going on two years now.

                And now do folks see why I keep saying we can NOT rely on them and their promises to
             allow our office any reliable use of aircraft? This really is a final straw. I do NOT want
             to hear them string us along again- but please send them the message that this is very,
             very disappointing and now we're moving on and away from ever relying on that mode of
             transportation.

            We're working on a bill signing for late next week in Dillingham for the family.
            Representative Edgemon would like to sign his Head Start bill in Dillingham and he'll be
            there Thursday , July 3rd.



            We could fly you and the girls out mid afternoon on Weds. Janice pulled flight options
            and I ' ll bring those with me so we can review tomorrow and discuss return if this is of
            interest.
