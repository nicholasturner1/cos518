                   Subject: Meeting tomorrow morning

                 Governor,
                 I scheduled a 15 minute meeting with you in the morning (9:00-9 : 15) to go over my final recommendations
                 on 7 of the 44 boards . Mike and I met this morning and came up with a list of names and final decisions on who
                 should be re-appointed . We'll get these confirmations knocked out in a couple of short meetings so you can get
                 back to focusing on the gasline . Again , the statutory deadline is Wednesday , Feb 14 by 4:30.

                 Thank you for your time! I do appreciate how accessible you are -I know you're extremely busy!
