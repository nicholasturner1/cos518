        I have Nikiski on hold until I am told whether or not you need that day for budget work or
        special session work.  It's on my list to go over with COS today. I'm assuming we would
        need to fly there via King Air?

        I still don't see the confirmed fundraiser on any of the schedules in front of me. And is
        the Nikiski event on the 27th a go - or still tentative?

        Scotty fundraiser is June 27, and you/Kris are confirmed for this. The

        Cathi Geerin fundraiser is June 26.

        If this is the same scotty gomez fundraiser, you confirmed already with

        DJ Bob Lester from KWHL that Kris Perry and I would be attending.
