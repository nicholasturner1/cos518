           Enough already




          Did Sarah Palin abuse her power as governor and fire Walt Monegan for not firing Trooper
          Wooten? I think the question is reasonable to a certain extent. And that extent is long
          past. This is no longer the topic. The topic is really how can we roast Sarah Palin. I
          mean, let's be adults about this. Was she wrong in being concerned for her safety and that
          of her family? No. Should Trooper Wooten still be a State Trooper? No. Did her staff know
          how much it bothered her and did they act on that? Yes. Apparently Sarah Palin is a little
     f    too "transparent" to those close to her, they knew how she felt. Fear for your family is a
          hard thing to hide. So, they knew it bothered her and they did something about that.
          Should they have? I don't know. I guess it goes back to whether or not Trooper Wooten
          should still be a State Trooper. And the answer is No. Are we done dragging this through
          the mud and hearing about it on Dan Fagen -and the news? Aren't there other issues that
          really need to be discuss

          ed? I mean enough already!




          Sara I don't know how you do it, this is a thankless job. If there is anything I can do
          except be angry on your behalf please let me know.
