        Dear governor Palin. At the Msc graduation last night regent fuller

        Cowell made a point of asking me to convey to you or someone near to you

        his concern that you are neglecting ed Rasmussen .               According to Cowell

        Rasmussen should be called by you. I have no idea what this is all

        about. I just listened without comment and nodded my head.

                              Talis.
