            Dear governor palin.  I just spoke with mr svobodny. Be has just confirmed with the clerk
            at home that there is no extradition request from Colorado for you to approve at this
            time.  You are not delaying anything because nothing has arrived for you to approve.
            Talis.

              Press has reported they're waiting on me to extradite. We'll need to correct that if
             press believes we're sitting on it. Thanks
