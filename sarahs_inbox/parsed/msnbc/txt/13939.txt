             We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't let their                        issues
             go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are working on it.

             Governor-



             I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

             could cover budget items as well as CON.

             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list
                                                                    1

             that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

             screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

             to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

             outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
