              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                            No. 08-XXX

                                    Governor Palin Urges Exxon to Pay Plaintiffs

             July 1, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today encouraged Exxon Mobil to
             pay the $507 million in punitive damages plus interest awarded by the U .S. Supreme Court
             to plaintiffs in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill lawsuit. The Governor has directed Attorney
             General Talis Colberg to write a letter to Exxon requesting prompt payment of the punitive
             damages to the 32, 000 plaintiffs in the case.

             "These people have suffered long enough," Governor Palin said . "While Exxon may have the
             ability to delay payments, I strongly encourage them to bring this sad chapter in our history
             to a long-overdue conclusion. It is time to end the misery so everyone can move on."

             The Governor Is hopeful plaintiffs will receive payments this fall. So far, though, Exxon has
             not indicated whether It will cut checks to plaintiffs right away, or seek further reductions in
             the award as the case goes back to the lower courts.

              Humanities Forum, Rasmuson Foundation award $900,000 to Alaska Statehood
              Experience projects

              Anchorage -

              A community mural in Seward, a poetry performance in Juneau, a film shot by Kotzebue youth , and a new
              Atlas of our state are just some of the ways Alaskans are getting involved with activities that explore,
              debate and commemorate Alaska's 50th anniversary of.statehood with support from the Alaska
              Statehood Experience project . Alaska Humanities Forum and Rasmuson Foundation today announced
              the award of $921 ,284 to 28 projects across the state that not only delve into the history of Alaska
              statehood, but also examine its meaning as we look ahead to the next 50 years . The complete list of
              project awards follows this release.

              "The Alaska Humanities Forum was thrilled to receive high-quality proposals for Alaska's Statehood
              Experience - and from every region and across such diverse groups," said Dr. Greg Kimura, president
              and CEO of the Alaska Humanities Forum . "These projects will create an historical legacy that will outlast
              the 50th anniversary , enriching generations of Alaskans to come."

              Rasmuson Foundation President Diane Kaplan added , "Alaskans have great stories to tell about the
              place they live and the life they love. Each of these projects elicits and shares those stories, and creates a
              living narrative that we can continue to write as we progress into the second 50 years."

              Proposals were reviewed by a panel of Alaskans who made award recommendations . The panel
              members were Cathy Rasmuson (Rasmuson Foundation ), Evan Rose (Alaska Permanent Capital
              Management Company), Barbara Baugh , Sue Hull, Katie Hurley , Sonya Kelliher-Combs (Artist), Andrew
              Kwon, Cathy Munoz , Rep. Mary Nelson , Kris Perry (Office of the Governor).

               Subject: Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008

               The President has signed into law a temporary federally funded extension of unemployment
               benefits. Under the new legislation , each state may enter into an agreement with the
               Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to act as an agent of the United States in paying these benefits.

               In order for these benefits to be available to unemployed workers in your state beginning the
               week of July 6 , 2008, please execute the attached agreement between your state and the
               Department of Labor and return it by Noon EST, Wednesday , July 2 , 2008. To execute the
               agreement, your state name and the state agency that will be responsible for making these
               benefit payments should be inserted in the appropriate spaces on page one of the agreement;
               on page three insert the name and title of the official who signs the agreement and your state's
               name in the appropriate spaces . If an official other than the Governor signs , the Certificate of
               Authority section must be signed by the Attorney General or other authorized legal official and
               the official's title inserted below the signature line.

               Please print a copy of the agreement for signature . After the governor or the designated state
               official sign the printed copy of the agreement , please send via email a PDF copy to
               EUC2008 .OWS@DOLGOV or you may fax it to Cheryl Atkinson , Administrator, Office of Workforce
               Security, at (202) 693-3229. Following receipt of the signed agreement , a Department official
               will sign it and return a completed signed agreement for your state 's records.

               Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making these benefits available to
               unemployed workers in your state as quickly as possible. If you have questions or need
               additional information , please contact Betty Castillo (202-693-3209), Stephanie C. Garcia (202-
