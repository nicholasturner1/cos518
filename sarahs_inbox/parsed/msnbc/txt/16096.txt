           Itll be after 2:30- probably after the funeral even (and that'll be a call from the road
           so don't know about cell reception on the Parks Hwy)

           Governor - I know you both have been playing phone tag on trying to return the call to
           Mayor Begich.  The Mayor just called for you now. I let his office know that you are not
           available until after 12:00 p.m. The Mayor would be available at 2:30 p.m. for a call.



           If we set the call for 2:30 p.m. the contact number to reach Mayor Begich - 343-7101.




           Thanks, Janice .
