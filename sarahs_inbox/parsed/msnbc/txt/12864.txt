                  Governor Palin;

                 Thanks for being tough against those Capital Projects you vetoed last year . Unfortunately
                 for me, I'm not sure which ones they were however I am concerned that many of the
                 Capital Projects of which I am aware were appropriations to church and/or related facilities
                 that suggest expenditures In violation of Constitutional prohibitions of Church/State
                 Separation. If, per chance , any of those projects are for church related facilities, I hope you
                 will veto them and preclude a court challenge as to their constitutionality . Your veto will go
                 a long way toward avoiding a lot of unnecessary time, energy, and of course , money. I
                 thank you in advance . Sincerely, Clyde Baxley
