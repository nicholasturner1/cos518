               Just saw in today' s paper that Conoco announced plans to spend 1 billion dollars on
               exploration and production in Alaska , nearly 22 percent more than the amount the company
               budgeted for Alaska investment in 2007 . The week following ACES ' passage Chevron announced
               an increase in capital spending for both new North Slope and Cook Inlet work.
