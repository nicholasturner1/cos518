                 Subject: UAA/AST SA Study


                 UAA Justice Center and AST completed a "Descriptive Analysis of Sexual Assault Incidents
                 Reported to Alaska State Troopers 2003-2004."

                 This is NOT in response to the Amnesty International Report (that was mostly anecdotal and
                 crafted with erroneous conclusions), but rather something that was put in motion prior. Nor is it
                 inclusive of all Alaskan jurisdictions, like Anchorage, Fairbanks, etc. who have their own police
                 departments to investigate sexual assaults.

                 This study was meant to give an objective view on how we are doing, and there are some areas
                 that AST must improve, but this provides a good baseline.

                 This also can be the platform in which we later launch our Sexual Assault Vertical Prosecution
                 Plan, hopefully in 2010.

                 This is just a heads up for the announcement and upcoming press conference.

                 Any questions, contact me anytime.
