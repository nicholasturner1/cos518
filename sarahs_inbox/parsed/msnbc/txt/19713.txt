                        McAllister, Bill (GOV sponsored); Mason; Janice L (GOV)
               Subject: Bill's correct address
               The reason no one can email McAllister is because they misspelled his last name when his email
               was set up.

               Reach him at Bill Mcalilister <b.mcallister@alaska.com> or bill.mcalllister@alaska.gov
