            MESSAGE:

            According to the "News-Miner ," the Board of Game has requested that the Amphitheater
            Mountains be made a "wildlife refuge ." Please don ' t. I am neither a miner nor a hunter. I
            do frequently use that area for winter recreation. There is no need to turn the
            Amphitheater Mountains into a wildlife refuge. To do so would almost certainly curtail all
            other uses . The board of game is being narrow and parochial.
