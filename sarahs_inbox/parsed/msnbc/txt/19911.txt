              Governor.

              It went well. I think in terms of timing, ease of administration, and getting something to all Alaskans the
              resource rebate stands out as the best vehicle. The debate started with legislators questioning which
              proposal before them is the single best thing to do but I think are now realizing that its not an 'either - or
              situation. Now my sense is that legislators are figuring out that it's not a competition among the different
              ideas and bills and they can only pick one, but that they may have to pass several bills to come up with a
              good solution.

              Committee members had some good questions and some concerns about language in the bill that I will
              work with LAW, Kelly, and Rep. Meyer's office to get straightened out

              Also, it is great working with Kelly. She has brought a lot of knowledge and skill to the position.

              Dear Privile

              Again, thank you for e-mailing the Office of the Governor and calling Ms. Leighow. Your comments are part of the
              total amount of information arriving at our office that concluded with Mr. Kopp's resignation.

              When facts become disputed and have significant impacts on people 's lives, it is important to everyone involved
              that further efforts are properly and carefully taken to conclude a matter. That was done in this case.

              Not worried about responding to critics with this one, the intent is merely to explain that great
              effort WAS put forth to show support, inlc Todd spending two valuable days... And my greater
              prioritry being congressiaonal visit for anwr tour that conflicted with a pageant.

              Rosanne: can you do this - Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:
              No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with the video Andy and Jason took
              great effort to make, where I'm saying "rah rah" in support of the participants... and my husband took TWO DAYS of his
              slammed schedule to judge the pageant even !!! He left commercial fishing early to keep his committment to judge the
              thing!!! (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so no, I didn't make it in person, I
              was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to fairbanks to meet with seven members of the US Congress on ANWR,
              but... Sheeeesh- can folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of support" on something . Argggggh!
                You know, I think I'll do my own letter of correction on this one.
