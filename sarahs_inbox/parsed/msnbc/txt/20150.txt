             You'll want to park on the northwest side by the main entrance (near the

             metal sculptures).      They said that you can come down the regular

             entrance that you are familiar with and go to the security desk. Jeff

             Beamas the head of security will be there to let you in.

             Tara- would you let Security at Sullivan Areha know that I' m going to

             swing in there this morning ( before I go to the airport for Fairbanks

             trip), I'll peek in and say thanks to some coaches at the huge youth

             basketball camp they're conducting this week . I should be there no later

             than 9:30. Thanks
