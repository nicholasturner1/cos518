             What is this event? When is it? Where? And how did they think I was going to be there?

             Despite multiple advance contacts (both Janice and myself spoke to Dick Brickley) Ice
             Alaska has run radio and newspaper ads (today) to say that Governor Palin and family
             would participate in the March 8 lighting ceremony.

              I have spoken to Dick and he is very aware I am unhappy. He has pulled radio ads and
             cancelled news-miner ad, and has apologized profusely.

               Commissioner Bishop will be at the awards ceremony .

              International guests are streaming in today for tomorrows reception.
