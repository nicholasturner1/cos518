            Yes- I may have never answered Katz on that - but it would be good for alaska I presume.

            Are you interested in the chairmanship of the Natural Resources Committee? I'm not sure
            whether that had been finalized w/Katz. If you are, I'll follow-up w/him so he can
            inquire.
