            Governor - There are a couple of scheduling items that we need to get confirmed for you.

            Saturday, October 13 - After the ACES meeting from 10:30 - 12:30 p.m. - The Washington Post would like to do
            a 15 minute Interview with you in regards to Corruption and Pebble Mine. They would travel out to the Valley and
            meet directly after ACES meeting. Sharon Leighow will have briefing paper for you prepared.

            Monday, October 15 - There is an ACES Town Hall meeting in Kenai from 6:00 - 8:00 p.m. - I have it listed as
            FYI on your calendar. This is the only ACES meeting that we do not have you confirmed. You can depart ANC
            @ 5:00 p.m. - arriving Kenai @ 5:25 p.m. You can then depart Kenai @ 8:15 p.m. - arriving ANC @ 8:40 p.m.

            The other invitation that has arrived for Monday, October 15 - From Walter and Ermalee Hickel is a request for
            you to attend a reception on the occasion of the Arctic Energy Summit. This will be in ANC @ Hotel Captain
            Cook from 5:30 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. This will not be possible if you are traveling to Kenai for the ACES meeting.
