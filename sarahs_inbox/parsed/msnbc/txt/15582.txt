               Governor,

               You've been so swamped these last few days, I didn't have a chance to confirm with you whether you'll be
               attending the AK Airlines event tomorrow at the AK Aviation Heritage Museum, 11 a.m. In the case that you do
               attend, I have compiled information and remarks for you. They are in a briefing binder on your office chair, and I
               have attached the most pertinent info to this email. Please let me know if you have any questions or requests.

               Thank you!

               Kate Morgan
               Communications Coordinator
               Office of Governor Sarah Palin
