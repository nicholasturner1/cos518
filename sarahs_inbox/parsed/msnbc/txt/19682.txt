                Good morning everyone,

                Senator Olson and Willow want all of you to know that they had their baby - 8 lb 6 oz Donald , Jr - yesterday at
                4:35 am! Both Mom and baby are doing great and everything went smoothly ... and quickly . Willow and baby
                were released from the hospital yesterday and were actually in their home in Anchorage by 10 pm. The Senator
                will be delayed getting back to Juneau and when he does arrive, I'm told he will be coming alone, so
                unfortunately, we will all have to wait a little while longer to meet Jr. - but he can tell you all about him when he
                does arrive . They are happy to have their "bundle of joy" and wanted to share that great news with you right
                away.

                -Denise
                Staff to Senator Olson
