             Sounds pretty cool. I'll look at their site, I think I've seen the show. It sounds like a
             great venue for energy talk, and even predator control.

            Another opportunity that is an off-shoot of the NY trip - PBS' To The Contrary would like
            to interview you in D.C. when you're at NGA.

             If you would like to do this interview, they would need no more than 20 minutes, which
             they would edit to a 5- minute segment.



            To The Contrary is a 15-year-old radio show that uses an all-female team of news analysts
            and panelists. It has a diverse group of women from all sides of business and politics.

            The show covers national and international issues and policies.



            Here is a link to the show.

            http: //www.pbs . org/ttc / <http://www.pbs . org/ttc/>



            They are willing to work around your NGA schedule and are willing to find a location in
            the conference center to tape if you so desire.




                                                                   1
