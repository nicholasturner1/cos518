                 Since my father, Robert Gouin was selected to be Commissioner for the DNR of the state of Michigan
                 back in the late 60's , I feel compelled to suggest a good , professional , and moral man for the ADFG
                 position , namely, Corey Rossi . This is an area of government that will have all Alaskans watching for
                 success or failure. Please give Corey Rossi your consideration . Thank-You! Linda Menard and Curt
