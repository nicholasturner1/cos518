            Governor,




            State Supreme Court decision 3-2 holds the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional.



            There are 40 states that currently have parental involvement laws

            There are 26 states that currently have parental consent laws

            There are 3 states that have ruled them unconstitutional:

             California

             Florida

            and now Alaska


          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            More info including the actual ruling are coming, but shall we -have Talis work with Mike
            and Sharon on an appropriate response?

             Frank,



                          The Governor should be told that this morning the Alaska Supreme Court issued
             a decision in the Parental Consent case. The Court by a 3-2 majority, in an opinion
             written by Justice Dana Fabe, held the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional. I am
             the attorney for the State of Alaska in this case and I will be happy to brief anyone on
             this ruling.



             Kevin

             The Supreme Court has issued a decision today in the parental consent for abortion case.
             The state lost, 3-2, with a long dissent. Kevin Clarkson is going to email me the
             decision and a summary . The decision is embargoed until 12:30 today.
