           How something as trivial as idle costs of a building becomes a headline is beyond me. I
           have cautiously responded to Stephanie of ADN for months. She is constantly trying to
           sensationalize simple facts to, in my opinion , assure a follow up story when the situation
           turns up different than reported.



           The insinuation that there will be $600K left at the close of MM ' s books is a perfect
           example . I have emphatically expressed to her that we are managing the facility as
           responsibly as possible and we hope to be able to return some of the appropriation, but I
           have made no projections.

                                                                 1

           I am amazed that ADN continues to make this a front page issue.



           I have a phone call in to ADN for a correction.

           Joe,



           The Gov asked this morning if we are spiking the fact that the $$ to keep the light/heat
           running would ' ve been spent even under the shutdown plan of the previous Board.



            I told her I would pass it on to you.



           Thanks bud!
