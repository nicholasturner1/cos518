          MESSAGE:

          Dear Sarah,

          Our son and daughter in law gave birth to Isabelle nine years ago and she has Down
          syndrome ........... she is a gift to all. Eliza has written a book called "My Friend
          Isabelle" and it actually became a best seller in Colorado where the family lives. I want
          to send you a copy of the book ......... please advise me on the proper address you would
          like me to use.

             Our son's name is Todd and Isabelle was born in April.

          Our best to you and your family

           Carol Woloson
