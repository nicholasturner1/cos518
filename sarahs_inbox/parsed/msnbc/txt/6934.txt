           Nice email that came in from a friend of mine in the Legislature. I thought you would get a kick out of it.

           My money is on her getting that bill on her desk by Monday.

           I think she should take them to town. Call them out the way she did Randy. Damn, I would love to talk
           to you about this. She has to step up and be the leader now. She's the principal of capitol high and the
           football team did something wrong. What does the principal do? She calls and assembly and she reads
           them the riot act, the whole group is tainted by the actions of the people who actually did something
           wrong because they all play for the same team, they are all members of what is now, in the eyes of the
           people, a corrupt legislature. So she lets them all have it and then she does what every good parent
           would do, she gives them a chance to redeem themselves. The ethics bill is a good chance. Giving the
           inditees the chance to resign before they are pulled out of office and further embarass themselves, their
           office, and the state is another.

           At some point soon she is going to have to start talking. This is her chance to take charge, but if you ask
           me I would say she has to hold a hard line. If she goes in there with sympathy for them she is never
           going to take control of the situation. I think the people are pissed and disgusted with the legislature, is
           she lets them off they will be just as disgusted with her.

           Ok. Sorry if that is a bit of a rant. If you want an opinion from one of those people who didn't vote for
           your boss, but has come around to be part of that 90+ percent of people who think she's on the right
           track don't hesitate to ask me. I really want her to succeed. I think she is the right person for this job
           right now.

           Catch you later,

           Ethics? Friday? Do you know something I don't know, or is that just wishful thinking.

           Friday sounds like a plan.

           Amen. I hope the actions of a few do not overshadow the good work that goes on in this building.

           HEY!

           So, I think we should go out Friday after you boss gets to sign her ethics bill into law...;-)

           If that doesn't work its no big deal; I am not leaving until the weekend after Memorial Day, so I'll be
           around for a couple of the quiet weeks.

           Bob is a very nice guy . I am glad you liked the note.

           Hope all is well. Please wish your boss good luck this week dealing with these hooligans. For my money
           I would say that she should ask any member who as brought shame to the legislature to resign before
           they drag everyone else down with them. But, I may still be a little bit angry....

           What's up? Hope you had a great weekend . I got out and had a lot of fun . We have to get together this week. I
           just realized you guys are all leaving within the next two weeks. Hangar. You say when what time.

           I'm still working on getting your book signed . I have it on my table as a constant reminder. I keep forgetting to
           take it down there.

           Also, can you pass on to your boss that I appreciate the nice card he left in my office this weekend. What a great
           guy. He's one of my favorites in the building.
