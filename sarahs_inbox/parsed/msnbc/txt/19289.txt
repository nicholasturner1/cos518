           Sorry, I'm just a little on-edge after the past couple of days. This whole gasline
           episode has been a long and exhausting ordeal.

            Governor, Kris,



            Here i s what I believe to be the "final " concept paper for the "In - State Gas " Conference
            on Monday .  This paper has the blessing of both ANGDA and ENSTAR and this is the concept
            we are all working off. And, hopefully , their comments will be pegged off it as well.
            The following people will be at the press event, although other representatives from the
            entities may show-up:




            ENSTAR:



            Gene Dubay , Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems           ( owner company of ENSTAR)



            Colleen Starring , Regional VP for ENSTAR




            ANGDA:



            Scott Heyworth , Acting Chairman



            Harold Heinze, CEO


                                                               3




                                                                                                            PRA GSPOI_0020300

           Marcia Davis, DOR




           Marty Rutherford, DNR




           I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for 1:00pm on Monday, July
           7th, in your Anchorage Conference Room. They have also been advised that you will be
           announcing this formation of a project development venture (a public/private partnership)
           and will be laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and Harold
           Heinze making brief statements. I have asked everyone to be at your offices about 15
           minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into the Conference Room together.




           I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you, Governor. Should
           you wish anything else, please let me know. My cell phone #: 317-4728.




          Also, we have identified a series of people to pre- message this announcement to and we
          will be making those calls on Sunday evening and early Monday.




          Thanks for all your support, Governor, and for your recognition that dealing with in-state
          gas needs is critical! It was a great insight that I believe will push the AGIA License
          over the edge!

               I explained that to them. They seemed more hung up on regs than anything. I am hoping for the best.

               Itta DID want the family there- it'd be more offensive to have NOT brought at least one of them to such a family-
               oriented celebration.

              Comparing Murki's travel is key here.

              Also I bet Kris could get Mayor Itta or someone to indicate the desire and/or specific request from the community of
              Barrow for the whole family.

              This is of course ridiculous. The community of Barrow was elated that you and Piper visited.

              Huh? Is he writing a story on the First Family's invitation to attend a native celebration? The state only bought one, one-way
              ticket for only one other member of the First Family (only the return f1t), as not all 7 of us attended, of course.
              When we're invited to a family event I do road trips when possible, but Barrow aint a road trip. They were thrilled at least
              Piper could make it out of the first family members.
              And we didn't even spend the night so no hotel!
              And my travel is 1/4 what Murk's was, despite having a large family that's always invited to all these Alaskan first family
              events.

              Governor -



              Just an FYI. I talked with Kyle Hopkins at length about First Family travel . He specifically asked about the Barrow trip and
              why the state should pay for Piper 's travel expenses. I explained at length that there is a certain obligation and expectation of
              the First Family to participate in community activities and make public appearances. He said/ will say that I could not give a
              specific regulation that spells out First Family travel guidelines . I told him that it is unfair to ask me for a specific regulation
              - after hours - before a holiday and if necessary , I would call Nizich or Linda at home . He said that was walking out the
              door and he would let his editors know of my concerns. I insisted that he - attribute to me , that a regulation exists.

              Hopefully, I will portrayed accurately in the paper tomorrow . Thanks.
