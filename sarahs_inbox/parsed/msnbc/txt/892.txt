I will forward up to Tara/Kris and see if they recall anything like this. I had not heard of it either.
Thanks, Janice

Hi Sarah,

I am following up with you on a product I left in your Anchorage Office

about a month ago called Ethos 4. I also left a 2 page letter

explaining how to use it in your personal vehicles. Did Todd get a

chance to use it in his snowmachine? I hope he is doing well. This

product is the same one that can be used in the marine highway system

that could save the state 2.3 million in fuel and maintance costs. Here

is the web site http://www.4planetearth.com/index.php if you have

questions or comments please give me a call Jerry Budd 907 345-2997.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Jerry Budd
