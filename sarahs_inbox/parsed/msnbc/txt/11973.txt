            Let me touch base with some folks in the Valley. Governor, maybe Scott Richter knows him
            or the dad? I could give him a call.

           Don't know him but if anyone else does- like ivy or other valley folks, then we can put my
           name on his letter.

            We received a request for you to do a letter of support (endorsement ) for a Jonathan
            Stinson , Big Lake , AK. He has been nominated to represent Alaska at the National Young
            Leaders Conference in Washington, DC.




            It looks like his dad may be the President of the Big Lake Chamber of Commerce.



            I just wanted to check to see if you knew this person before declining. Thanks, Janice
