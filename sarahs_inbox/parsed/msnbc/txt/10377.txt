              No one else is ready but me and piper- but we're on our drive in now. Everyone else will
              have to be hooked up with commercial flights then.



              We'll see DPS in one hour.

              Governor - The ceiling here in Juneau is starting to lower. We would

              like to have you all at the airport asap - Please let me know what time

              you can all be there and we will notify DPS. Thanks, Janice
