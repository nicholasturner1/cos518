            It was a shot over the bow.          Some folks in Palmer are responding via

            letter, but wanted to give you a heads up as you head into the home

            stretch.



            More important, happy 1 year everybody!

             Ugh- you're right. Harris has been sort of pouty the last couple of

              days.



             You're right on about the conflict issue.

             Did you hear john harris on the news??? There shouldn't be a conflict w

             chenault running the fin committee b/c there's not a conflict having

             todd on the slope. HUGE difference! Todd isn't a lawmaker! He's not

             considering or voting on any legislation that will effect our entire

             state.
