         Ohhhh, I thought I was supposed to do more... that's why I planned my Fairbanks trip
         around this renewable energy fair. I should have planned to just stay in Fairbanks instead
         of making the two trips. Hopefully the energy fair is worth it.

         only a couple of minutes long... are you sure I'm the keynote? I'd think

         this should be much longer. Did Joe or Steve add to this?
