               It's confusing- the ADN has been such a stickler making sure EVERYTHING I've ever written
               in an op-ed is factual, but then has inconsistently allowed Halcro and Fagan to print bs
               in their op-eds as recently as yesterday and today.




               Halcro- stating I said I "didn't understand the budget", thus didn't cut $150m as I said.
               I've NEVER said I didn't understand the budget, that's total bs - why would I claim that?



               Fagan- stating he called me during the campaign after he had lunch w/oil industry and I
               asked "what lies are they telling now?". Hmmmmm, sure don't recall that- but I do recall
               Fagan claiming on his show that he NEVER had/has lunch with industry folks.



               Sharon-. if ever you get to talk to ADN about this, pls do. Can their columnists print
               anything without verification, but our op-eds are scrutinized so thoroughly before
               printing?
