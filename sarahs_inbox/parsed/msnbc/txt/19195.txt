          Governor,



          Mary and Cheryl assisted me with the content, yes. Kris had me run it past Nizich, and we
          tweaked it a bit before sending it with Mary this morning. She was thrilled with the
          letter and the Alaska book and promised to provide a thorough report on her trip :)

          Please let me know if you have any further questions . Thank you,



          Kate

          It doesn't need to go through proofing- it's good to go- did they ask for this specific
          content and greeting though?

         Governor,



         I apologize for the late hour. Here is the letter for Mary Glazier that I promised to re-
         send your way for approval. It should show up as an attachment, as well as in the body of
         the email. Once it has your approval, I'll format it and have it ready for Mary and her
         flight to Japan tomorrow.



         Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you,



         Kate
