              Thanks. I will get you a copy of Harold Napoleon's book right away. I think Senator Dyson is
              feeling his age here. He reminds me of some other people in his age bracket who get grumpy
              and impatient, because they know the clock is running out - and they're passionate about
              getting something done. Fred has raised so many foster children of alcoholic parents. His
              heart is in the right place - and hopefully Randy Ruaro and I can sit down with him soon -- and
              talk about what the state can and can't do to make his vision a reality. He's in a big hurry to
              get started right away. But we need to make him understand that his vision would be better
              served by some good planning - and the right timing - which would be at AFN.

              I think it would help greatly if you could visit with Dr. Walter Soboleff. This would do a lot to
              reassure Senator Dyson of your commitment.

               In the meantime, I'll get Harold's book out to you in the mail.

              Excellent update on this, thanks Rhonda. May I get a copy of that book? And it's unfortunate
              that Dyson's been so hostile towards us about this idea since he first approached us with it last year, I
              said it sounded great & asked him to work with our Leg Liason (who's not on the 3rd floor anymore)
              and let me know what I could do to help... he never got back with us until he wrote a pretty scathing
              letter re: why we hadn't followed through on his request to set this up. He understands our time
              constraints we're always under, but I understand his passion for this, and I share it - just wish he could
              help with more of the logistics of setting everything up, as he says he's been desiring this and working
              for it for some years. Please continue to work with him on this commission or committee, hopefully
              he'll take some ownership of this and work with like-minded legislators and members of the public to
              assist us in setting this up.

                Senator Fred Dyson met with the Governor in early 2007 to discuss reconvening the Alaska
                Natives Commission -- a joint Federal - State body, created by Congress in 1990, to review
                policies and programs that affect Alaska Natives.

                Senator Dyson says two men inspired him to take action:

                   · Dr. Walter Soboleff, a Tlingit elder who will turn 100 years old this November.

                   · Harold Napoleon , author of "Yuuyaraq : Way of the Human Being ." Napoleon wrote this
                     book while serving time in prison for battering his son to death in an alcoholic blackout.
                      The book gives a historical perspective on why Alaska Natives abuse alcohol.

               THE VISION. Walter Soboleff and Harold Napoleon want a state task force comprised of
               Native elders:

                             *to review the Commission's report

                             * to assess the status of Alaska Natives since the report came out in 1994.

                             * to find out how much progress has been made on the report 's recommendations.

               Senator Dyson says there 's a spiritual aspect to this as well -- that Soboleff and Napoleon
               believe God directed them to him, to help make their vision a reality.

               Some of the goals Dyson describes:

                   · to "redirect Alaska Native attention to spiritual values and transformation"

                   · to bring together "a group of godly men and women from Alaska 's Native peoples to
                      meet and study the many Native problems and identify solutions."

               Originally, Dyson considered introducing legislation to resurrect the "Alaska Native
               Commission ," but said it would be difficult to restrict members of the panel to "people with deep
               spiritual conviction."

               Dyson now believes it would be easier for the Governor to appoint such a panel by executive
               order.

                                                      CURRENT STATUS

               This issue was brought to my attention in mid-February . I've met with the key players.

                   · 2/26/08 . Met with Harold Napoleon
                   · 2/27/08. Met with Fred Dyson.
                   · 2/29/08 . Met with Fred Dyson & Dr. Walter Soboleff


                                               HAROLD NAPOLEON MEETING

               This meeting was quite emotional . I've known Harold Napoleon for many years , but he's
               never spoken so intimately of the day his son died - the day his spiritual journey began.

               At the time, Napoleon was head of the Association of Village Council Presidents, one of
               Southwest Alaska 's most powerful leaders.

               But alcohol brought an end to all that . Napoleon described the confusion when he awoke in a
               strange place after a night of heavy drinking -- how Trooper Jerry Hooper gently told him what
               he had done , even took him outside to get some air . Napoleon said time literally stopped in
               the room where he was held - that it seemed like hours had gone by . But when he looked at
               the clock, only five minutes had passed.

               And from that day in1984 forward , time would keep dragging on . Napoleon spent nine years in
               prison. But out of this time of darkness came an important book - that sheds new light on old
               problems.

               While in prison, Napoleon had time to talk with other Native inmates - and found they had so
               much in common . These discussions sparked a desire to learn the root causes of Native
               alcoholism . In his book , "Yuuyaraq (you-yuh-hawk) : The Way of the Human Being," he
               discounted the role of genetics - and said the primary cause of alcoholism is spiritual not
               physical.

               Governor Walter Hickel was among those deeply moved by the book . He later tapped
               Napoleon as an advisor in efforts to bring about a change in the Native condition.

               Napoleon now believes genetics it plays a greater role than he once thought , but he still
               believes the central issue is inter -generational trauma . Today he talks about this trauma
               passes from generation. to generation through child abuse.

              To break this chain of death and self-destruction , Napoleon says Alaska Natives must return to
              the source of cultural breakdown - the "Great Death ," a series of epidemics which struck
              Native communities from the 1770's to the 1940's, which wiped out the "old culture."

              Napoleon says Alaska Natives do not realize that Native culture today is very different from
              what existed before the "Great Death."

              Napoleon believes a Native Commission could make a big difference , by helping Natives
              understand their past - a process that will take open and honest communication.

                                               DR. WALTER SOBOLEFF MEETING

              This meeting was also quite powerful . How often do you get to sit down with a 99 -year-old
              man, who is so clear in mind and heart - so humble , yet so great?

              Aside from reviewing the Alaska Native Commission report , Walter Soboleff would like to use
              the commisison as a vehicle to reconnect Alaska Natives to their "old culture" - which was
              governed by an elaborate set of rules to promote good behavior.

               "Good behavior is prevention ," Walter said . "We have the best of doctors , clinics , everything,
               but now we need to let people know they need to behave themselves."

               Soboleff says the commission needs to focus on "delinquent parents ," because "parental
               delinquency is contagious."

               Some of the other concepts he would like the commission to promote among Alaska Natives.

                  . The road of progress is under construction and you are one of the workers.

                  . Every village, every community is a teacher . And a community teaches us well. We must
                    ask: what kind of lessons are Alaska Native communities teaching today?

                  . All cultures have family values , cultural commandments . Take the best of each culture.
                    Take the best of both worlds.

                  . Share codes of conduct and protocol from different Native Cultures.

                  . Native people need to speak out about bad behavior . We act because we care. If we
                    don't speak - and don't act, it means we don 't care.

                  . Good people need to support the helpless , but sometimes good people are too busy.


                                  FEEDBACK FROM OTHER ALASKA NATIVE LEADERS

                  · Most like the idea of a Native Commission to explore Native issues and give feedback to
                    the Governor . They point out that other states with much smaller Native populations
                    than Alaska have departments set-up to deal with tribal groups . They would like to see
                    something similar and see the commission as a good start.

                  · Senator Dyson gave us a list of people to tap for the commission . All were Native
                    religious leaders. Almost all of the Native leaders I spoke with think this panel should
                    have broader representation.

                  . A number of leaders say they would like to see a mix of elders and young leaders on the
                    panel. They believe this would energize and inspire a growing number of talented young
                    Natives.

                  . Some wanted to see subsistence included . Others felt that this would be too divisive -
                    that nothing would result and the commission would lose credibility.

                  . Some say the scope of this task force should be limited - that if it was asked to do too
                    many things , it would fail - that it would be better for the Governor to give this board-one
                    assignment with a short time frame. Upon completion , the Governor and the group
                    would decide whether the board should live on. If so, they would then decide what the
                    next task would be.

                   . Others thought the group should serve as an advisory board to the Rural Advisor, who
                     would pass on their input on current issues to the governor.
