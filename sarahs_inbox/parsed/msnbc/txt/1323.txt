MESSAGE:

Ms. Palin, I know you don't have time to read emails that are beyond what's necessary to govern the
state, but I wanted to express how refreshing it. is to have a leader that hasn't forgotten that she is a
representative of the people who elected her. Thank you for your care and respect of those you
serve and may God bless you and your family.
