            Hi Governor,



            You had asked for a visual representation of the per capita budget appropriations of the
            House Finance CS. I got with Andy and he worked up a really great Alaska map and punched
            in the numbers I gave him. He tells me that it takes about 2 hours to have it printed so
            we'll want to make sure we can get the timing right so you have it for use in a press
            conference before the bill hits the House floor (I'm assuming this is the reason for your
            request).



            I've attached the graph but I don't know if you can view it from your Blackberry. We're in
            a bit of a holding pattern here at the office right now and I'd be happy to run a paper
            copy over to you at the House if you'd like.



            Please let me know what you decide.



            Thanks

            Mindy
