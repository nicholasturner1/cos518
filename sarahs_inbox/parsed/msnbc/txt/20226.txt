           Governor - Sorry to have missed your call. I am still here at the

           office.    I just talked with Linda Perez to get more clarification.



           The Kyle request was for all Governors' travel and who traveled with

           her.   Apparently the travel desk has been trying to get Ivy to sign her

           travel.    Ivy was B & C when the travel was taken according to Linda.



           When you signed all that stack of TA's at the house last Friday evening

             it was only the top copies. Janice

          like Ivy' s? (These also list Ivy as B and C staff , which she isn't)
