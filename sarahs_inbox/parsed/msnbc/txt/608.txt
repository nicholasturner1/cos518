  Hi Todd,

  Thank you for the information on your trip to Donlin Creek Mine. Sorry for ALL of the
  questions, but I went through the TReport with Mary Lou so that I could just ask ALL of them in
  one email- and avoid any delays in processing this. You mentioned that meals were provided, but
  if they didn't provide you with dinner- then you get reimbursed for it, so I'm just double-checking
  to make sure.

  I attached a copy of the Travel Report that I need to submit for your trip to Donlin Creek Mine.
  The information I need is in bold print and I'll also write out a list of those questions.

  Questions for Travel Report:
  Arrival time to Anchorage (Was-Anc)-
  Airlines-
  Flt.#-
  Dep. and Arrival Times (ANC-Donlin)-
  Form of payment and ticket cost-
  Who paid/arranged travel-
  What meals did they provide (lunch/ dinner)-
  ANC (Anc-Was) Dep. time-
  Question for TA:
  Purpose: Travel to Donlin Creek Mine with Commissioner Notti and Commissioner Bishop to...
  (address mining issues? work force development issues?). I just need a bit more specific
  information for the purpose. Sorry I don't know anything about the D.C.Mining issues, so I
  couldn't think of how to complete the purpose.

  Thanks! !
  Erika
