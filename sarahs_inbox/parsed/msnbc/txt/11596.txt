               Hi Sarah,
               I want to personally thank you for meeting with John and me during our recent trip to Juneau . Our problem of
               waterfront access and the construction of a new tank farm seem a lot closer now with your help and the help of
               your assistances. The entire community of Gustavus is thankful for your efforts and I believe we will find a route
               forward through this dilemma.

               Thanks so much for your continuing help.

               Sincerely Ken Kiawunder - Mayor of Gustavus
