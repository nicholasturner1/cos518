           Best wishes on your new baby. Just a short new for you to approve the 4 million dollar
           funding angda, for the instate gas bullet line. Myself and bill warren were in juneau
           last month and passed all the information to Mr. Balash on instate gas use and the bullet
           line, we had a very good meeting with him and appeciate the time he gave us. The main
           thing we need in our state is value added jobs and an instate gas pipeline would do the
           job.  thank you for your service to our state GOVERNOR.PALIN.   Sincerely patrick hawkins
