         ASMI reported that Id travel to promote our seafood. I remember reading that in an article
         tho ASMI hasnt talked to me about it. Maybe incorporating that into the trip? Id been
         invited to visit that all Alaskan wild salmon rest there in NY.

         ps:  One other thing occurred to me. Since you will be in New York, you might want to
         consider making the rounds of some of the media outlets.



         We have talked about ways to disseminate the messages that Alaska is under new management
         and that we are ready and willing to provide domestically produced oil and gas to the
         nation. New York is the headquarters of most of the major media, and I think that there's
         a curiosity about Alaska and you as the new Governor.

         I can't speak to the issues you mentioned, but there's not much happening in DC that week.
           Putting Congress aside, there is little pending at the Gubernatorial/Secretarial level
         in the various federal agencies.




         Until we see the pattern of AGIA applications, I don't think that there's much to tell the
         agencies with pipeline interests.  Even FERC is in a wait and see mode.

        Thanks. I do want to capitalize on my East Coast trip that week though. There may be other
        options hopefully.

         I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy .  The congress

         and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.
