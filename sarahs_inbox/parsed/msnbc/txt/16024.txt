              also attached a brief white paper on the legislation that you may find helpful . Bob will leave a briefing booklet in
              your vehicle, so you'll have it as soon as you arrive in Anchorage tomorrow . Janice will print out remarks for you
              today so that you may look them over at your convenience . I just wanted to highlight the following details:

              -this is a ceremonial bill signing
              -bill sponsors Rep. Thomas and Sen . Therriault are unable to attend , but will be honored in remarks
              -staff from People magazine will be present
