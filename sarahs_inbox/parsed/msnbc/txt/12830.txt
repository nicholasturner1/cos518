           Not only are there no flts to get me there on time Friday, but we're told it's not within
           the ethics act to travel for GOP function, which is fine and I agree with... But what is
           puzzling is why we're hearing that even dropping into the mtg in the evening (which I
           thought would be "off hours") to make a quick intro of the keynote speaker, is something
           that couldn't be accepted under new ethics act.



           I'm not going to beat my head against a wall over this - I either get there or I don't...
           and I feel bad for Janice having to ask Gary for assistance on finding flts- evidently he
           doesn't look fondly on doing travel anymore, as I believe he's also told Todd he doesn't
           do travel. The option of taking the kids out of school for another two days to catch an
           evening flt to ensure a Friday in Anchorage is taken off the table.

           Thanks - and don't worry about all this - again I'll get to Anchorage at some point to at
           least meet with the Mayors who've requested another mtg.
