       Tib: would you find for me the fiscal impacts on budget as we fight for the $48 mil Muni
       Rev Share - how it fits in with our proposed PERSTRS contribution. We'll be asked about
       it, no doubt, in tomorrow's press conf. We'll be asked if this 48 mil takes the place of a
       portion of the PERS contribution, or can we afford this IN ADDITION to PERS fix.
