            Subject:                 Cabinet Emails List


            Governor - I have updated your contact list on your state computer/blackberry. Frank will
            update your personal blackberry with the same information.




            I have also made a distribution list based upon the correct emails for your cabinet that
            you can use and not have to put in each one separately when contacting all Cabinet
            Members.  These are the ones that the Cabinet has stated go to them only and they will
            delete any others that had previous access to these accounts.




            This is named: Governor Cabinet Only.             I have listed them out below alphabetically. If
            you would like anyone added/
