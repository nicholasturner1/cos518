           House needs to bump the rebate way above the Senate's version. And I need assurance
           Revenue can get the checks out attached to PFDs early... fuel barges take orders earlier
           than the October PFD disbursement. The public does not know that our intention is to get
           surplus $ into Alaskans' hands before October. Pls let leggies and the public know that.
