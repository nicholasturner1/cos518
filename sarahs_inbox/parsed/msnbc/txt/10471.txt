              Speaking of email, I'm getting double of what you're sending. Kris are you getting dupes
              also from the Gov's email?

              Yeah, I had no idea what he's talking about. Just read it and knew you'd appreciate it.

               I apologize for writing this anonymously , but there ' s never been a forum offered for such
              blunt comments on the state email mess . I also fear retribution for speaking my mind. I
              also apologize for my sarcasim , but at this point, it's the only way I can deal with it.



               I don't know who ' s idea it was to throw a party for ETS and give awards for the mis-
              implementation of the new email system , but it was a HUGE slap in the face to employees in
              other departments who devoted time and effort to try to make it work . Not to mention, it
              doesn't work properly ! But the worst part is that NOTHING is being done about the
              inadequacies of the new system.
                                                                 2

               Thanks for using technology to make it harder to do business . I thought it was supposed
              to be the other way around.



               But, whatever is easier for ETS ,      right?
