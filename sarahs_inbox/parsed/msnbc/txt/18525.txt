         J- pls note for sched I ran over to MatMaid during their lunch hour so I could say hi to
         employees.



         It was a nice and uneventful visit and tour of plant, considering the fuss they made last
         time I tried to visit. No hairnet or paper shoes were even required, no CEO accompaniment
         was required, etc.



         Pls pass on to Franci Havemeister so she'll know, in case critics try to make something
         out of my short and sweet "pop-in" to the plant, so that I could say hello to employees.



         I need Franci's email addy, too.
