           I'm not sure my first email response went out to this as I recd an error.



           To answer your quesiton: No, I do not recall any such thing ever happening. Actually the
           contrary.  I remember you calling him - and I also - to let him know that we did not
           support their efforts and understood if they wanted to withdraw their support.

           meeting I have with Darwin Biwer (from Darwin's Theory, I presume). In this he says I
           called him during the campaign to request his assistance in combating Knowles' effort to
           oppose gaming... and that "the problem never actually came up but we were ready".



           Huh? Do you remember anything like that? I remember him coming to our office with a group
           of CHARR guys, and I remember calling him from a Southeast airport to say I couldn't
           support their expansion of gaming ideas. I think I made that call to return his, or
           because something about the gaming initiative had been in the paper that day?
