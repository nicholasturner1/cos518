             Thank you Ivy. The press does buy into the leggies inaccurate portrayal of "doesn't
             communicate " - what was our muscommunication cause all last session , and now starting this
             session?  It was Bitney.

              No, Steve I don't . agree . You think because the governor was able to give a speech
              yesterday it should excuse the behavior of the Legislature .   I disagree . The governor
              should not be accused of mis-communicating ( again !) with the Legislature when she
              transmitted her request to them in December. John Bitney knew then that Track was
              graduating from infantry training and instead of drafting a letter to send to the Senate
              with the requested time in it he sent a letter that said 7:00 pm. The miscommunication is
              on behalf of the House via John Bitney.



             Furthermore, the Senate said that they were sticking with 7: 00 because it was the
             "traditional" start time and so Lyda could allow time for her members to arrive in Juneau.
             WHY would she then propose a 4:00 pm start time-how would an early time leave room for
             her members to file in? Then in this morning's ADN article Cockerham said the governor
             "bristled" at Lyda's implication of "accommodating her personal schedule." The governor
             did everything in her power to COMMUNICATE and ACCOMMODATE the Legislature, and she's
             still blamed for the miscommunication?   Does she need to copy the media on every
             transmittal letter to the Legislature to show how well she actually communicates? I mean
             Steve , she's the governor. She's a natural, God-Given, communicator.   And you, having sat
             down with her so many times, know how gracious she is with her time, how accommodating she
             is, and how well she articulates her message.



             Just my $.02. I respect your objectiveness, and the way you capture the essence of the
             governor's message in your articles; however, I will continue to hold your feet to the
             fire. I know you wouldn't expect anything less from me. And, I extend the same courtesy to
             you-if you see me inaccurately describing something, or if you think I'm ever off base
             just let me know. I can handle the constructive criticism and can stand to hear another
             point of view.



             Thanks,
