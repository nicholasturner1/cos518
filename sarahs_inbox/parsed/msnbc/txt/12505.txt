           Any friend of Rush's is a friend of mine ! Actually, I was completely unaware of your
           success until Rush spoke of it. And, after studying your fine web site, I agree, you
           WOULD make a fine V-P candidate!



           Seriously, you have a beautiful family and I wish you well as you lead your state during
           these difficult times.



           Sincerely,




           Terry Richardson
