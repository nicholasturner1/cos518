             I stressed with Sean the $1,200 and also the returning the surplus to the resource
            owners, Governor.

             It'll be $1200, you can let reporters know that- and it's all about RETURNING surplus
            revenue to the people of AK- the resource owners ... That should be the message ! That, and
            "short-term" energy relief as we work on long-term solutions... This helps bridge the gap
            and allows people to fund conservation efforts.

             But please clarify w reporter ( s) that the debit card idea is too expensive to administer,
            so plan changed.

              You wish!

             Nah... and I just told the local Kenai reporter that we'd be "saving money" with our
            shift in thinking... a direct check to Alaskans instead of debit/credit card idea. It
            makes sense . It's all good.

              Gov. Sarah Palin is preparing to drop her proposal to offer $100 - a-month energy debit
            cards to all Alaskans . But she's looking at replacing it by asking the Legislature to just
            directly send everyone money instead.

                                         Governor Palin Pleased with FERC Decision

              June 19, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided today that
              the owners of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline - BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc., ConocoPhillips
              Transportation Alaska Inc., Exxon Mobil Pipeline Company , Unocal Pipeline Company and Koch
              Alaska Pipeline Company LLC - failed to prove that their 2005 and 2006 rates were just and
              reasonable . The FERC ordered refunds to TAPS shippers that are estimated to result in at least
              $ 600 million , plus interest, in additional tax and royalty revenues to the state.

              "I am pleased that the FERC agreed with the ruling made by our state regulators in 2002 , that the
              rates being charged by the TAPS carriers were not just and reasonable ," Governor Palin said. "This
              decision shows how having a pipeline constructed and operated by the producers can result in
              inflated tariff rates that cause the State of Alaska significant revenue losses and discourage others
              who do not own a share of the pipeline from developing the state 's oil and gas resources."

              The case began in 2004 when the state protested the proposed 2005 rates . Anadarko and Tesoro
              also challenged the rates . The FERC will set a new rate for future shipments after the TAPS
              carriers make a compliance filing. The Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources will be able
              to calculate the total revenue owed to the state after the FERC determines the timing of the refund
              payments and sets the prospective rate.

              1.    ALLIED WASTE AND REPUBLIC WEIGH POSSIBLE $6.77
                    BILLION MERGER
                   Republic Services said that it is in talks to acquire its much larger rival
                   Allied Waste Industries in an all stock transaction worth about $6.77
                   billion. Both companies confirmed the talks in a mutual press release last
                   week. A merger between the number two ranked Allied and number
                   three ranked Republic would create a formidable competitor (with $9.3
                   billion in combined revenues) to number one ranked Waste Management
                   which had revenues of $13.4 billion last year. Allied's roughly 22,000
                   employees operate a network of 300 collection companies, 164 transfer
                   stations, 169 active landfills and 53 recycling facilities in 37 states and
                   Puerto Rico. Republic employs about 13,000 and operates about 135

                     solid-waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities. Together the companies
                     would own 228 landfills and 257 transfer stations and 86 recycling
                     facilities. The merger is especially interesting because Republic does not
                     add many new markets to Allied's existing portfolio. The notable
                     exception is Las Vegas where Republic has a very strong presence in
                     that rapidly growing area and Florida, from which Allied had retreated in
                     recent years. Rather, the combination appears to present an opportunity
                     for both firms to better integrate existing markets, especially in Indiana
                     and Ohio which are important for their proximity to the Northeast... Read

                     GAIN
                     Casella Waste Systems reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $7.8
                     million or $0.31 per share, compared to a loss of $20.3 million or $0.80
                     per share in last year's fourth quarter. However revenues for the quarter
                     rose to $139.6 million from $126.7 million last year, exceeding analysts'
                     expectations. "This was an exciting year for our team. We made great
                     progress on all of the operational and financial goals we set at the
                     beginning of the year, even in the face of a weak economy In the
                     Northeast," John W. Casella, chairman and CEO. The company is
                     optimistic for fiscal year 2009 in which they estimate revenues of
                     between $610 million and $628 million. ..Read More s


                3.   INTEGRATED WASTE SERVICES ASSOC. CHALLENGES STUDY
                     ON ZERO WASTE
                     Last week we reported on a study called "Stop Trashing the Climate,"
                     which criticized waste-to-energy for contributing to climate change. Ted
                     Michaels of the Integrated Waste Services Association has countered
                     that in addition to erring on the facts, the groups miss the big picture,
                     especially since waste-to-energy is a net reducer of greenhouse gas
                     emissions. On average, communities that utilize waste-to-energy have
                     higher recycling rates than the national average. He also points to
                     Europe which has achieved the world's highest recycling rates by either
                     banning or severely restricting landfill use and using waste-to-energy to
                     manage whatever cannot be recycled... Read More s


                4.   REPORT SAYS BIOMASS TO PLAY BIG ROLE IN EUROPEAN
                     MARKET
                     A new study suggests that biomass will play a significant role in the
                     European energy market and will be crucial for attaining 20%
                     renewables use there by 2020. The study entitled "Strategic Assessment
                     for European Biomass Energy Markets," by Frost & Sullivan describes
                     rising energy costs and the need to reduce carbon emissions as driving
                     demand for biomass feedstocks where it already represents two-thirds of
                     all renewables. Currently biomass accounts for about 5% of total
                     European energy consumption but Is as much as 15-20% in countries
                     such as Finland, Sweden and Austria where it is supported with specific
                     policies. High capital costs and poor fuel quality remain as the principal

                5. VIRGINIA WASTE IMPORTS DOWN SLIGHTLY IN 2007
                     The good news for Virginia is that out -of-state waste imports decreased
                     by 2% in 2007 ; however, the amount of in-state waste declined by 9%
                     meaning that imports as a percentage of all waste disposed actually
                     increased . They are now about half of all waste disposed according to
                     the report by the Virginia DEQ . Maryland, New York , Washington, D.C.,
                     North Carolina and New Jersey represent the top five exporters ... Read

               6.   DELAWARE SENATE RE3ECTS RECYCLING FEE DEEMED
                    UNFAIR
                    The Delaware Senate recently rejected a bill passed by the house which
                    would have added a $3 per ton fee to all landfilled waste to support
                    statewide recycling programs . As usual, the devil was in the details. For
                    example, municipalities already recycling would be exempt but as Alice
                    lacobsohn, director of the Maryland and Delaware Solid Waste
                    Association points out, "These new taxes would be assessed
                    unequally... many Delaware residents - who recycle on their own, would
                    not be exempt and would be forced to pay, nor would the exemption be
                    offered to local businesses that already have recycling programs."
                    Others pointed out that the fee would have created more administrative
                    overhead and been a burden to residents already struggling with higher
                    fuel and energy and other costs.. .Read More s

                    The Electronic Industries Alliance is challenging Maine's two-year old
                    electronics recycling law, saying that it violates federal law governing the
                    transportation of hazardous wastes . The group, which represents
                    manufacturers and recyclers , has asked the U .S. Department of
                    Transportation to effectively strike down Maine's first -in-the-nation
