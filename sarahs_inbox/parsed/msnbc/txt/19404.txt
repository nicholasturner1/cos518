           John, will an early dinner on the 20th in Fairbanks work? The picnic concludes at 3pm. I
           realize that's too early but close to it would be helpful, i.e. 4:30.

           I will defer to the Governor on this and her desire to attend but the 19th is going to be
           difficult as the Governor will be in Anchorage that day for an event.

           I have made contact with the office of the House Minority Leader. The bottom line is that
           the Governor is invited to have dinner with Mr. Boehner and his entourage Saturday (July
           19th) or Sunday in Fairbanks.




                                                                 I

           The staff recommends Saturday, because the House members will not be as tired, and the
           Governor could also offer some welcoming remarks. Sunday is less preferable for several
           reasons-




           I also asked whether the Governor could actually accompany the entourage to the North
           Slope.  The staff is checking with Mr. Boehner and will get back to me as soon as they
           can.




           Please advise whether either July 19th or 20th is a possibility. I will let you know as
           soon as I hear about the North Slope portion of the trip.




           P.S.




           I understand that the Governor will meet with the Republican Challengers group on July
           17th.  So, there should be no conflict with Mr . Boehner ' s trip.
