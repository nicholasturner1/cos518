            Dear Governor Palin,

                 Yesterday the Traditional Tribal Council and Tribal Court of Togiak "banished" Togiak
            City Police Chief Aaron Parker from Togiak. They sent him a two page letter signed by
            several Tribal judges giving him thirty days notice to vacate town. Today we are sending
            him a letter stating we do not believe they have the authority to "banish" him. This is
            the latest round in what seems to be a slowly escalating feud. I will try to keep you
            posted.  talis
