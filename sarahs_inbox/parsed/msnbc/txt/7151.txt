            Hey guys,

            I just got the heads up Governor Palin will be in Anchorage on Friday . The Anchorage District Court judge
            interviews are Friday morning from 10:00 to 11:00 am . I'll fly up there for the day and/or weekend to assist unless
            I hear otherwise . I think Mike and/or I should be there to keep the interviews moving, but I'll wait to hear from you
            guys. I'll fine with whatever you think is appropriate . My thought is that I don't want you (governor) to get bogged
            down in these interviews or have new staff familiarize themselves with the nominations and also facilitate.

            Thank you,
