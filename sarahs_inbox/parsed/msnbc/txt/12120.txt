              Governor,



              Things went well at the AIDEA board meeting today. After the delays and confusion of the
              past few weeks, I think we're now on a clear path forward.



              The board agreed with the direction I outlined to expedite the AEA Director search, and
              we've scheduled five interviews for Monday with the intent of making a recommendation to
              you a day or two later. I suggested we plan to forward 3 names with a strong recommended
              order of preference.

              The current names are : Steve Haagenson , Mark Foster ,            Eric Yould, Tony Izzo, and Jim
              Hemsath.



              The asst AG reviewed the conficts issue and basically said that, absent some personal
              contractual arrangement, there shouldn't be any legal conflicts for a new AEA Director.
              He specifically said that he didn't see any legal conflicts for Haagenson.



              Finally, the board agreed that no statutory changes are needed to implement the hiring of
              the AEA Director and the splitting of the organizations. We'll seek funding for the
              Director through the budget, rather than a fiscal note.



              Let me know if you have any questions.
                                                                     1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0012043
