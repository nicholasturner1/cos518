            I like "minority" Sen. Bunde ' s ideas about savings accounts and preparing for years ahead
            when the state will not have as much money .   Paying down the TRS / PERS debt would certainly
            be helpful and save a lot on interest on that debt.

            Love you, pray for you every day.         Keep up the great work you are doing!
