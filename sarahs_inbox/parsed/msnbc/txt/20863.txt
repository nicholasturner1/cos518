              Dear Gov. Palin:

              Will you come to Texas for a luncheon fundraiser?

              We were in the Snow City Cafe this AM and over heard Jay Ramas talking about
              you and a vote to be taken this afternoon. We said hello and asked if you were in
              town and that we loved you-wanted you to come to TX. He said you were not
              smart and were dangerous. He said he would vote for McCain -but not you.
              What is his problem? He seemed like he had an unfair agenda about you.

              We have surveyed people here since our arrival and passing out McCain/Palin
              stickers (we had printed in TX) and they either really like you or love you.
              We love you too and will be working here on our trip and in Texas when
              we go home.

              God Bless and Good Fortune and please let's win in Nov.

              Sincerely,

              Barbara Dewberry

               Subject: Court Orders being violated - These are crimes in the State of Alaska that are not investigated nor
                        enforced

             To Whom It May Concern:

             These are some more court orders being violated.
             I also have pictures and video of the damage and items.
             Yet the Trooper's will not open an investigation nor provide me with any information I've
             requested.

             These are crimes in the State of Alaska that are not investigated nor enforced.
             The people involved:
             Kathleen R. Johnson -
             aka Ranell C. Cox
   i         aka Kathy Cox
             aka Ranell Bagge
   i         aka Ranell C. Johnson
              Our investigation shows her legal name as Ranell C. Johnson. We have Washington State
             Court documents showing this was the only name change. Her social security number has also
             been changed.
             and Edward Lee Cheeks.

             Trooper Carlson,

             RE: Reported violation of court order 8/3042008 4:30pm - 38365 Evergreen Dr Sterling

            Thank you , coming out to look at my Sterling home on 8130/2008 4:30pm.
            The reason for this email is to provide it to the courts to show I did indeed attempt to file a report of violating a
            court order.

            I've have attached the court orders that Kathleen Johnson has violated . Would you please reviews these orders
            and confirm that you are not willing to investigate and or make an arrest in this matter. The damaged items are
            valued at around $ 20,000 not including the items in the house.

            I would also so like copies of the log notes and pictures of the items you took.

            The reason I'm asking you , is the records department , Trooper Shanigan and Guymon are not responding to my
            past requests for Trooper reports.
            Ms Holt and here son are directly involved in the false charges against me.
