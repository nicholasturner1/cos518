          Governor, do you know how loved you are? These four or five bitter people are so NOT
          representative. You are so, so loved. The enemy is trying to discourage you. Hang I there!
    `I    You are doing such an awesome. job. You are an amazing lady and the Lord is your defender.
          He knows the truth and He is going to vindicate you. It hurts my heart to hear these
          horrible people are bringing you down. We forgive them, Lord. Help theses people come to
          know You.

          Guys, I may be pretty wimpy about this family stuff, but I feel like I'm at the breaking
          point with the hurtful gossip about my family that Sherry and others get away with. Bear
          with me. I hate this part of the job and many days I feel like it's not worth it when they
          have to put up with the hate that spews from people like Sherry, and there are others.

          Below is the email Don sent to ADN. It's not much, but we were trying to bring there
          attention to this ongoing and very frustrating situation. Her comments are downright
          libelous.  You're right-she's a crazy hater.

                     Dear Sir or Madam,




                   I'm writing to bring your attention to the increasingly inapropriate comments
           posted by the blogger syrin. Every day she posts comments that have absolutely no bearing
           on policy.  For example, today the ADN posted a positive story on the national press
           Governor Palin is receiving, yet syrin accuses the governor of having an affair or makes
           hateful comments about her young children. I don't often feel compelled to write, but
           syrin's comments are never on topic, nor are they civil as is stated in the terms of use.




                    Thank you for your time.




                                                      3




                                                                                                   PRA GSP01 0020543
