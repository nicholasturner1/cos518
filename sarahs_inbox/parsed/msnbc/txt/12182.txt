             The pole room was reserved , one bed.... The gal said she couldn't tell who made the
             reservation - I didn't sign anything or give her any different credit card to reserve
             another room because the girls were tired of waiting at 2am, so though the gal at the desk
             was sure there was no other room I asked that they let two of us stay in another room and
             I'd settle up in the morning. So- I'll make sure they have my signature and credit card
             for this second room that Piper and I slept in when I go down to the lobby in a bit. Pis
             let Linda Perez or whomever know that I'm using the state credit card for that. Thanks -
             it all worked out, just need Linda to know of that credit card charge I'll be squaring up
             with this morning.

             We had two rooms reserved. Tom confirmed yesterday again. It should have been "the lodge
             pole room with an adjoining room. Melissa confirmed when she went and picked up the key
             cards for the room.

              Just arrived. Princess has us in only one room, only one bed. I'm haggling with them now
             to at least get one other bed for the four of us tonight- and more space even when the
             First Gentleman arrives also.



              Not sure why they believe I only wanted one room and one bed for a family of six...
