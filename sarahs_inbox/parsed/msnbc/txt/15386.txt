          I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
          they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



          Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
          ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
          mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
          one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
          Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
