               Thanks...

               Bc that's not a good practice to deny - media ends up getting it anyway (and rightfully
               so), so my choice would bne to disclose.

              From what I understand , Carlisle - MM's largest payable - requested that we keep their
              information confidential . I will look more into this to make sure I'm not missing anything
              because I thought we were only denying that piece and that there was more to their
              request.

              Anyone know why "the state" refused to comply with KTW 's FOIA request for MatMaid info?
