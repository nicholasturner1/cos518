                 Governor,

                Pat Galvin called me to pass along that the company who invested and lost $6.2 Billion in bond proceeds from our
                employee's retirement accounts has made a settlement offer. The offer is to make the $6.2 million loss whole.
                One half would be paid at the end of the year and the other half would show as a fee rebate paid at the end of the
                fiscal year (June 30, 2008). This is good news. Not that long ago, we were contemplating an appropriation to
                make the employees whole. We suspected that many of the employees holding on to a significant amount of
                bonds were likely to be close to retirement and the loss would be very significant. It will be a good announcement
                once everything is final.
