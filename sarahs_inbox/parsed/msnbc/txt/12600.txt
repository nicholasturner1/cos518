            MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,

               I have been reading about you being considered as a possible running mate for John
            McCain. I did some research and having you on the Republican ticket would sure make me
            feel better about voting for Senator McCain.

               I will keep my fingers crossed and hope to see you as the next Vice President and in
            the future, THE President of the United States!



            Your truly,

            Andy Kirkpatrick
