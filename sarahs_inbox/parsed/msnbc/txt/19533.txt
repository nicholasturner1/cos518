           Can someone flag the lie in the blog "sexy highway talk among governors" that claims Trig
           was in the fender bender with me- and he wasn't in a car seat on my commute. Sheeeesh.

              I WISH ADN would follow up on that one (as the blogger asks ADN to do) so that I can
           put that rumor to rest... Rumor is Walt reported me so I fired him. What an idiot blog
           entry, very easy to counter with the truth when half a dozen APD cops responded and
           witnessed no Trig in vehicle.
