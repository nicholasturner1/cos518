         Sounds creative and workable.



         I have staff from Juneau (the two who are left there) in town today and we have an all
         staff meeting this afternoon with dinner following at our place. Let me know what time you
         are thinking as soon as you know so I can flex the day's schedule.

         We'll work with you on this after I return from a morning Diversity welcome and one prison
         meeting. Thanks!
