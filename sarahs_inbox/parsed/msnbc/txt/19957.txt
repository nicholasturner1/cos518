               Dear Governor Palin,

                Thank you so much for the great job you are doing for our state. My family and I have faith in
               your leader ship. So I write to ask you about Measure 4. Yes or No ? My family is asking me
               how to vote and not knowing who to trust, I true to you.

               Thanks again. Clint Rowlett

               North Pole, AK.
