             Dear Governor Palin and Staff,




             Please accept my most sincere thanks for the opportunity to serve as your director of the
             Division of Motor Vehicles; it has been the highlight of my professional career.




             I will be leaving DMV next month and I wish the very best for each of you and especially
             for this Administration as a whole; truth, honesty and open government shall always be
             best for those governed by it.




             As I leave ,   I must point out that any success garnered here in last 4.5 years belongs
                                                                    1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0007101

             ,facet of state government in a venue perhaps unlike any other stage . Please support and
             thank them as often as possible for their dedication and efforts.

             successfully manage them for the maximum benefit of all Alaskans into the future.




             Thank you again for this incredible chance to . make Alaska just a little 'bit better!
