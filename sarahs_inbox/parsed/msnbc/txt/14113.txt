            Janice set this up . Do you want Rhonda on the. phone during this ? She really wants to be
            plugged in more fully on these rural / native issues.

            Dear Governor Palin,

                  If possible I would like to meet with you for 15 - 20 minutes on Monday to review
            the Kaltag case .  It is a Native " inherent authority" appeal that will be noticed in
            Native circles.   I need to approve or deny an appeal and I want you to understand our plan
            and have an opportunity to approve or stop it as you will be likely asked about it.

                     Just let me know if I can come over anytime Monday. Talis
