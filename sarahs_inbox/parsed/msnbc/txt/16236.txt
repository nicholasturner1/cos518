            Subject: Draft ANWR Letter




            Per our exchange of emails , I have drafted = the correspondence below from you to key
            members of Congress concerning = ANWR and related matters.



            The draft has been reviewed by our staff = here. I have also forwarded it to DNR and
            elsewhere within the = administration but have not received a response as yet. =



            My hope is to transmit the letter relatively = soon so that your views will register in
            the energy debate on Capitol = Hill .  If possible , I would also like to inject the letter
            into the = current news cycle since , at least for the moment , the media is focused on =
            ANWR and the federal OCS.



            The letter is not technical in nature .          = Therefore , I'm not too worried about receiving
            other comments.  =



            Once you have approved , we will work with = Janice on the mailing list , which should
            include the Democratic and = Republican leadership of the House and Senate , as well as all
            members of = the Senate Energy Committee and the House Committee on Natural Resources, =
            both of which have jurisdiction over ANWR .  I have also copied = President Bush and other
            members of his administration. =
