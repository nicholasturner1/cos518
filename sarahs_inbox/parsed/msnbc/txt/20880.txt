               A woman who did not leave her name called the Anchorage office and spoke with Tara . She said she was with
               Congressman Young' s office and that there was an emergency in Fort Yukon because they had run out of fuel. I
               am not aware of any requests for assistance from Fort Yukon and I have been trying to follow up with
               Congressman Young 's office in Anchorage . The lines are busy right now. I will keep trying. I will update you as
               soon as I can figure out what is going on.

               Randy

              Lynne:

              Similarly to Adak , can you check and see when Fort Yukon is due to get its municipal revenue sharing payment
              and whether they have any bulk fuel loans pending at AEA or bridge fuel loans pending at DCRA?

              Thanks,

              Randy
