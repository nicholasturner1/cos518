               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                No. 08-137

                        Resource Rebate, AGIA Top Special Session Accomplishments

              August 7, 2008, 3uneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today thanked state lawmakers for
              successfully addressing Alaskans' energy needs in the recently completed special sessions,
              both in the long term by authorizing a gasline license under the Alaska Gasline Inducement
              Act, and in the short term by passing an energy relief package.

              "The members of the Alaska Legislature worked honorably and diligently in the past two
              months to deal with these critical issues facing our state. I join with all Alaskans in
              recognizing and thanking them for their accomplishments," Governor Palin said.

                                                Resource Rebate and Energy

              The most recent accomplishment came late today as the Legislature passed SB 4002, which
              uses revenues generated from the state's resources to provide a one-time special payment
              of $1,200 to each eligible Alaskan. The bill will also provide energy relief.

              "After funding the state's priorities, putting billions away in savings and still seeing a budget
              surplus, the Legislature agreed to a special one-time payment, sharing part of our resource
              wealth with Alaskans, who under our Constitution are the owners in common of these
              resources, and who I believe can decide better than government how to use that share."

              The energy package totals $910.5 million. In addition to the $1,200 resource rebate to
              Alaskans, the bill also makes a 50 percent increase in the maximum loan amount for bulk
              fuel bridge and bulk fuel revolving loan funds to communities and cooperatives, up to
              $750,000. It also suspends the state's motor fuel tax on gasoline, marine fuel, and aviation
              fuel for a year and strengthens the Power Cost Equalization Program.

              Legislators also included additional $60 million for the Home Energy Rebate Program
              operated by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation and $50 million in supplemental funds
              to the Renewable Energy Fund bringing the total available for renewable energy projects in
              FY 2009 to $100 million.

              "Legislators provided Alaskans with a strong and diverse package of short-term energy
              assistance," said the Governor. "We can build on this good work as we bring forward a

               much more comprehensive energy package for consideration in the next regular session."

               A long- term energy plan is being crafted by Steve Haagenson , who, the governor appointed as the
               state's Energy Coordinator in March . Haagenson , who also serves as executive director of the
               Alaska Energy Authority, is developing a statewide plan to reduce energy costs, promote
               conservation and secure long-term supply solutions for each region of the state. Results of his
               work are expected by the end of this year.

               "It is also important to remember that all Alaskans have a tool already available to them to help
               with high energy costs: conservation ," Governor Palin said . "As Alaskans prepare for winter, there
               are some immediate steps that we can take to help reduce energy costs and lower the burden of
               these high prices."

                                                Alaska Gasline Inducement Act

               The second major accomplishment was the historic action of August 1, when the state Senate
               joined the House in passing House Bill 3001 . The bill authorizes the administration to award the
               AGIA license to TransCanada Alaska to permit, develop and build a 1,715-mile natural gas pipeline
               from a natural gas treatment plant at Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope to the Alberta Hub in
               Canada.

               "Because of the wisdom and foresight of this Legislature , we can finally look ahead to actually
               bringing Alaska 's natural gas from the North Slope to our homes, to our businesses, and to our
               fellow Americans in the Lower 48," Governor Palin said . "This action represents a critical step
               toward the future of resource development for our state."

              Legislators also appropriated $ 35.5 million for gas pipeline expenditures, including reimbursements
              for allowable expenditures under the AGIA license to get moving now towards a gasline.
