            Hi Governor Palin,




            I am a neurosurgery resident from Birmingham, AL - and also a lifetime Republican. The
            past few months have been rather depressing, with the thought of a Clinton or Obama
            administration. However, after hearing about you, I think you may be the ray of hope we
            need. A candidate that America would love, with impeccable conservative credentials.



            I really hope you consider the VP position if offered it. I also hope you will actively
            pursue it, and convince Mr.McCain that you can unify our party and country. McCain/Palin
            2008! I can already see the bumper stickers.



            Thank you,

            Mahesh Shenai, M.D.
