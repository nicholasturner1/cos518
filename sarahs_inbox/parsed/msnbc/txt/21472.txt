              Governor - I just spoke with McHugh Pierre and he stated that the scheduled time for
              departure is approx. 12:35 p.m. on Sunday, 10.28.07. 1 stated that you would be landing
              at approx. 9:20 a.m. McHugh will call immediately if there are any changes. We will have
              you go up on Sunday morning flight and then return back to Juneau on evening flight. Do
              you want Piper to return with you on Sunday morning flight also? Thanks, Janice

             J- it looks like the only way I could do this is to Iv Juneau on sunday morning, then turn
             right around and head back that evening - can you confirm the exact time of the
             deployment- ideally the later the better be I'm scheduled to arrive Anchorage late in
             afteroon. Bob will check fits for me.

              I'm thinking we should do this if you're in town. Will you be able to--I'm free to do it.

             Bravo Company, 297th Support Battalion will leave Alaska at 12:35pm on 28 October from
             Elmendorf.

             They will be boarding the planes at the Elmendorf Joint Mobilization Center.

             It would be an honor to have the Governor and the Lt. Governor attend this event and shake
             the hands of the Soldiers as they board the aircraft.

             Please give me a phone call if you need any assistance.

             Thanks,
