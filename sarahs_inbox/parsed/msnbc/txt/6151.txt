           Governor Palin:



         I am very upset and concerned about this new regulation that OSHA is

         attempting to put forth regarding new laws in the handling and storage of

         ammunition and the components used to make ammunition . It seems to me to

         be a undermining way of making ammunition less available and or more

         expensive to the citizens that both shoot firearms for competition and

         sport as well as the hunter that needs it to put meat in the freezer. I

         think the consequences of such new laws would be devastating to Alaskans

         in many ways .    Please do your best to help us not face these new laws that

         would greatly affect our livelihood here in Alaska.



         Sincerely,



         Roland Fein

         "One very concerned Alaska"



         Sincerely,




         Roland Fein
