           I'll be there- can't tell you exact time tho be it depends on drive time. And I'm still
           planning on tomorrow's blessing event unless Trig's doc appt in the morning tells us he
           needs a few days under bilirubin lights.

           Governor,




           You are confirmed to attend the Alaska Native Justice Center's "Building Momentum"
           conference in Anchorage on Monday morning. The event begins at 8:30 a.m. and, as it
           stands now, you are scheduled to speak last, at about 9:10 (approximate time). If you
           arrive at 8:25 a.m., you will be seated onstage at a head table with the other speakers
           (the attendees will be finishing breakfast); if you choose to come later, you could arrive
           at 9:05 a.m., sit at the back of the room until you are introduced, take the stage to
           deliver remarks, and then leave the event. Please let me know if you prefer to arrive at
           8:25 or 9:05 a.m. Also, if you'd like to speak first, that is also an option.



           Please respond at your earliest convenience. Kris will be dropping off information
           related to tomorrow's Bike Blessing as well as Monday's conference with you tonight.
           Thanks so much!
