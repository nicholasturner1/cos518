            Governor,

            I just spoke with TransCanada after their meeting with FERC. The message TC pounded home
            to Commissioner Kelliher was that the AGIA' expansion and Debt to Equity provisions of
            AGIA ensure the federal government monetary returns are $55 billion before the pipeline
            expands from 4.5 bcf/d to 5.9 bcf/d and $70 billion after expansion.    Therefore the feds
            have a huge stake in the commercial terms provided by AGIA - just like Alaska does.
