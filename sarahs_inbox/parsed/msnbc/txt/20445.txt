           If they want me as keynote then maybe I'm not obligated to be at their dinner that night
           also? If I am their keynote, pls have Balash and Click (and/or whomever else) work with
           Kate/Rosanne on the speech- last year's can be resurrected and added to, based on what was
           accomplished through the regular and special sessions on AGIA, job training, other labor
           issues, tax reductions, energy issues, etc. Thanks
