            And you spoke with them in the Anchorage office right after your letter went out, right??
            (Conoco that is...) Sounds to me like you're personally in touch almost weekly...

             And I know team members want time to chew on this, but as has already happened this
            morning with KTUU finding me at the NEA speech and wanting responses to CP's letter - we
            can't blow any tinmely opportunity to set the record straight, asap, and lay out facts
            when we are asked. Better yet, to be pro-active and anticipate what the public is wanting
            answered. Obvious to me is the public's questions: "why is she refusing to talk to CP"
            (not true, but that's what they're hearing), and "is it true she just doesn't understand
            how to get this project built" (shoot- don't defend me on this, but our team of experts
            had better be defended or Alaskans will continue to believe the big, pretty, expensive ads
            that CP pays for to tell Alaskans we're, essentially, naive, stubborn and idiotic).

             The response does need to be sent . It's fine , with minor corrections ... I don ' t want us
            to over - think the response and miss opportunity to speak to Alaskans . I WILL be asked,
            continually , until we release a statement.
