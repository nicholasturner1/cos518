               It has been an honor to serve alongside each of you as we've worked to support and defend the
               Constitution, serve the public with ethics and integrity, promote clear and transparent government, and
               fulfill the mission of our departments.

               However, the Governor has accepted my resignation and effective Friday, May 10th, Bill Hogan will serve
               as Acting Commissioner for the Department of Health and Social Services.

               Please welcome Bill warmly to the Cabinet meeting next week and take good care of each other as you
               continue your excellent work.

               If there 's anything I can do to support you, please let me know.

               Take care and God bless you!

               Karleen
