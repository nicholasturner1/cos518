           Governor Palin Responds to President's Call to Open ANWR




           April 29, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement
           after President Bush renewed his call to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil
           exploration in the face of surging gasoline prices:



           "President Bush is right. Here in Alaska and across the nation, communities are feeling
           the pinch of high energy costs. It is absurd that we are borrowing hundreds of billions
           of dollars from one foreign country to buy oil from another. It is a threat to our
           national security and economic well-being. It is well past time for America to develop our
           own supplies."
