              Christine , I have sent the Iditarod material to Randy Ruaro last week put I know he is
              very busy .   Keep it on your list to remind me to follow up before the next ITC board
              meeting .   I am hoping we can get some commitment from the Governor soon . I hate to push
              this at this time with the Legislature nearing the end. LEO
