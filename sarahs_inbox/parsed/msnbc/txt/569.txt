  Hey Todd,

  I'm meeting with Tibbles tomorrow and the Governor next week re: AIDEA, PFD, ANGDA, and ASMI.

  1) I wanted to check in with you to see if you had any names in mind of any key people with technical
  experience we need to get plugged in to AIDEA-this is the seat formerly held by Mike Barry.

  2) Also, do you have any native corp women leaders in mind for PFD?

  3) Any business guys/gals in mind for ANGDA? This is the board Heyworth serves on.

 4 And ASMI, it doesn't sound like we are going                   Cora Ives a couple of alternatives-
                  of                       and                     f                                  The,
 seat- has to go to a large processor (annua payroll over        on).

  I know this looks long, but I just need minimal feedback . Yea or Nay or any names you might have.

  Hope your picking lots of fish...
