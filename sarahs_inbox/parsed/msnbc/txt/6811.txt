               I was at the computer tonight working on my AH piece and went to AH 's biog . Someone pointed
               out to him today on his blog that I had the opinion piece in the Juneau Empire and asked AH to
               post it on his blog-which he did.

               Sounds like he 's drafting something on me entitled , "Coming Tuesday: The Lt. Governor, AGIA
               and a Chance To Be A Hero."

               Heads up!
