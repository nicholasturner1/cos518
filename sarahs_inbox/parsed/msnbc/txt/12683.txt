            I feel guilty missing this two yrs in a row ,            I may try to get there this time,       depending
            on travel options.

            They are expecting the first musher to arrive in Nome early morning wednesday. (I thought
            it easiest to just give Chas a call).

             Anyone on staff knowing about when the Iditarod wraps up? I didn't make it to Nome last
            time - if someone could find that out, and find out any flt availability... I doubt hotels
            are available at that time, but would like to know travel possibilities near Iditarod end.
            Thanks

             (Maybe Nizich could check? Or Mark Kelsey?)
