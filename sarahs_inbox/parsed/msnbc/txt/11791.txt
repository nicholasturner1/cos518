               Below is Mayor Combs' letter in the ADN today and an email he sent today. He says, "I meant every
               word."

               One mayor's view of presentation by Palin isn't shared by all

               Regarding the article published Jan. 23, "Municipal leaders seek more attention," I would like to
               go on record that not all mayors share the views of Mayor Joe Williams of Ketchikan Gateway
               Borough or the current president of the Alaska Municipal League, Tim Beck.

               I found the governor's presentation to be meaningful and concise, addressing the top two
               priorities of the league: PERSTTRS and state revenue sharing to municipalities. Gov. Sarah
               Palin's budget has increased the amount of municipal sharing by 50 percent and it appears we
               will finally reach an acceptable formula for PERS/TRS this session.

               I am thankful for the hard work the governor is doing on our behalf and would much rather
               receive 20 minutes of genuine and factual information than hours of mindless rhetoric we have
               experienced in previous administrations.

               -- John C. Combs, mayor

               Dear Ivy,
                 First of all, thank you so much for your assistance and information during my visits to Juneau. I believe
               that our spirit goes on and I can't help thinking how proud your father must be of you. You are a
               tremendous role model for young women everywhere.

                I did manage to get my letter to the Anchorage Daily News, published February 2nd. I have been
               receiving phone calls on this end telling me I was spot on with my comments. I meant every word and I
               hope the Governor truly realizes my dedication to her work.
