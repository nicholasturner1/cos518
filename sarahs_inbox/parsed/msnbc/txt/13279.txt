            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin:



            I heard about the recent addition to your family on the Glenn Beck show tonight. My
            family will keep your and your family in our thoughts and prayers. Having worked as an
            anesthetist @ Atlanta Children's Medical Center in Atlanta, GA. I know the challenges you
            face.  I also know that you have been blessed with a child that will love you
            unconditionally and will face any health challenges with a bravery unkwown to most adults.



            We face some speech problems with our adopted son, Walker, but your story reminds us of
            how truly blessed we are. God has placed this child with you because of the life you will
            provide.



            Your story serves as a reminder that there are still many good people running our country,
            even as the headlines would have us believe otherwise . You can be sure we will follow
            your political career and give you all the support we can muster.



            God bless you and your family.



            Sincerely,

            Abbie Kemper-Martin, MD
