             Governor Palin,



             I met you last year at the Alaska Moose Federation Banquet in Wasilla .                   I was one of the
             videographers at the event.

             I recently edited a short promotional video with las year ' s highlights.

             I posted the video on Youtube and thought you might want to see it. (You're in it)
