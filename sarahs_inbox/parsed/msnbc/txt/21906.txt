               Subject:                Character schools in Kenai


               Just finished meeting with three principals and the superintendent of schools. The
               district leadership eight years ago made a decision that they were going to be schools of
               character and character traits and language have become cultural in many of the schools.
               They have amazing stories and are willing to share what they are doing. Jay and I are
               pretty pumped about it. We asked if they would be willing to share their stories in other
               venues and they are excited to do so. Just thought you should know of another resource out
               here.
