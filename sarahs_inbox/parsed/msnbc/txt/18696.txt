           Before I forget to mention it, Dan had a 'packet' from AOGA in his studio when Jeff
          guest-hosted last Wed.  It had colorful charts, brochures, etc. Jeff said to Dan, "Dan?
          These are your talking points?". No or little response from Dan.



           Not that this is a shock, but it helps confirm what we've all expected.
