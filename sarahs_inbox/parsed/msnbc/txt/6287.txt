          There will be continued confusion after Doogan's article today re: me "waffling" on ppt
          now.



          I haven't waffled. We do need to revisit it - soon - I'm just waiting on the
          recommendation of WHEN.



         Confidentially - Bitney has created a lot of this confusion by telling others (we're
         hearing more accounts of this) that we changed our mind. NOW is the time to clear up any
         confusion so the timelines will be set and we can get things accomplished.



          I will be quite adamant in my answers to the continued question on sp session: "I haven't
          changed my mind. Of course we have to revisit.ppt, I'm just waiting on recommendation
          regarding timing of sp session. It's my intention to call this for October."
