                I would support their efforts there, for those reasons we spelled out earlier: the will of
                the people would be reflected in the constitutional amendment if it passed vs allowing
                legislating from the bench on such an important issue. Parental consent is such a
                reasonable thing - obviously it is because we require parental consent on nearly every
                aspect of a child's life... it's a parent's right and responsibility to be involved in
                their child's life.

               Governor-




               Steve Quinn would like to know if you would support a constitutional amendment regarding
               the parental consent law. Cog hill and Dyson are calling for one. Of course it would
               have to be placed on the ballot etc. Thoughts?
