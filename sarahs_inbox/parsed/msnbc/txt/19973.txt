          Since when is Todd Palin on the State payroll or administrative staff? What is his title
          and function within the state government. He keeps getting "confidential emails" along
          with your other staff members. He uses your office to meet with other staff members.
          What the hell is going on with your supposedly "transparent government". It's lost all
          transparency and now appears to have plunged into the realm of questionable ethics.
