              Pls format it or I can do it myself.



              And who's Bruce Anders? He works for DNR, I asked him to look at the op-ed for me to add
              anything important, and he did so. Did you really not know who he was?

              Too late to do any good at this point, but I will mention it in my travels and let them
              know it's up.
