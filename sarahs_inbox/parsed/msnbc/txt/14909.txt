           MESSAGE:

           Dear Mrs .   Palin,

           After reading an article in my local paper about both you and your husband' s response to
           your newest baby, I felt compelled to write and tell you thank you for recognizing the
           gift in Trig' s life and for your tangible demonstration of your commitment to life.   Your
           husband was quoted in his response to the news of your son ' s diagnosis - what witness you
           both give.   You are blessed in Trig as he is in both of you.

           With all my best ,     Margaret Darke
