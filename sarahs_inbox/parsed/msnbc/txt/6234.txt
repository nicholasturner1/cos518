         I know that you all want the best for your hardworking employees, and a one-size fits all
         solution isn't necessarily going to work. The union has turned down some of our
         initiatives and I'll. have a synopsis of those sent to you ahead of the Cabinet meeting if
         we're still on for Tuesday. I'll check on Monday and make sure the synopsis gets to all
         of you.

        I had the same experience as Walt ,             except my stack looks more like 8 inches.

        I have to admit they get a sympathetic ear from Commissioners who hear

        nothing but recruitment and retention complaints from all divisions. I

        recognize that we're in a negotiation , and I gave them no commitment other

        than hear them out , which I did .             I'd like to hear more about the proposed

                                                                   2

         I,   for one have been contacted, and left with an approximate 5 inch high

         stack of paperwork. I do recall that this general issue has been discussed

        between all of us earlier, I also understand that we are working for a fair

         resolution to these negations and had stated so.

         I'm aware that Bruce Ludwig,          Business Agent for the APEA-Supervisory Unit,

         has either met with some you or is requesting a meeting with you.                   I want to

         remind you that labor negotiations are just that - negotiations. We have

         been negotiating in good faith with the union which represents some

         employees in your department.




         I have my charge from Governor Palin and I understand what the bottom line

         is.   What I need you to do, is remember that as Bruce tells you his concerns

         - you have perhaps not heard the issues from my perspective.




        Please contact me directly with any questions you might have as a result of

        your conversations with Bruce. I have done more to be transparent about

        labor negotiations than, I believe , any other Commissioner , by posting our

        last best offers online .        You can access that information here:




        http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/ADMIN/LaborContractUpdate.shtml




        We are all in this together .          We all need quality, professional State

        employees .    Governor Palin has the draft administrative order I referred to

        in our last Cabinet meeting and I expect we'll be moving forward shortly.




        Thanks for your patience.
