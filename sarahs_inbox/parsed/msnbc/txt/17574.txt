         Subject:                  Bd of Game


         First msg coming out of Glennallen re: Bd of Game decisions: the Bd is NOT listening to
         the local advisory bds that are putting a lot of efforts in showing up for mtgs,
         "advising", doing a lot of homework for the bd, etc. And yet the bd makes decisions
         without seeming to hear the locals concerns. They're not notified when decisions are going
         to be made, for instance.



         And no one here is happy about the Tier 11 allocation dcisions. Question is: whyd bd make
         allocation decision based on INCOME - its now.a welfare program and nothing in
         Constitution speaks of welfare in terms of wildlife resources being allocated. I promised
         I'd send their message to Juneau. (And how do I get that msg to the Bd?)



         Also, hunters locally did go out to kill wolves for us thinking we'd fulfill promise of
         $150 fuel reimbursement and they sent in their info but now we "can't" reimburse them. I
         told this fellow we would be we said we would. Bruce Bartley has his name. Nice guy, not
         pushy, but wants to remind us they want to trust govt.



         Back to Tier 11. No one locally likes the income decisions nor equipment restrictions (an
         ATV can do more tundra damage than the allowed 1500 lb track vehicle). The locals just
         want to be listened to and were very glad we visited.



         They wanted to know if I supported the way the Commissioner was selected   I said I sure
         did be Denby is the result - and they were very cool with that. They just wanted to know
         that I supported the Bd's recommendation of Denby.



         And the school visit was awesome and went probably 45 min over be kids had great
         questions.




                                                                 1
