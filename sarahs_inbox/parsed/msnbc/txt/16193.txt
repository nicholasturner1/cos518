            Just need to be there the day before it begins...

           And you may need to find a ticket for Bristol, flying from Texas (if she can shorten up
           her internship by a few days), so pls check on that - leaving from San Antonio. Thanks

            We have not purchased the Philly tickets yet as it was dependent upon

            what you would be attending to see what date you would want to arrive

            and depart.     From what I understand we would be.purchasing tickets for:

            GOV, Piper, Perry, and one Security. We are still within the timeframe

            (21-day advance) purchase through tomorrow (Thurs.).



            I can go over these flights with you tomorrow afternoon when you arrive

            and/or list them out via email the choices for you to look over.

            Thanks, Janice
