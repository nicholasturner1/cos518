            I talked w/Commissioner Kreitzer on this as well (she's in Anchorage) and also Frank. Frank will assist.
            Since travel related to the Governor's office did not go through the State Travel Office until recently, they
            said those records would likely be through the Governor's office (Linda Perez). I have the international
            travel info.

            FYI - I've asked Frank Bailey to help me track down soem evidence of past administration's
            dealings with Bill Allen.

            Kris - I told him you'd be calling him. The International Trade Office folks will surely have info
            on this too . I was told today that there were NO meetings in four years between Murk and Bill
            Allen. I don't believe that for a minute.
