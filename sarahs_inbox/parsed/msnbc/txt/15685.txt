            MESSAGE:

            My name is Andromeda Romano-Lax. I'm an Alaska-based writer working on a publication about
            the Tongass National Forest, with the cooperation of the Forest Service. It will be
            published by Alaska Geographic.




            I an hoping to include a large section of stand-alone quotes from a select number of
            Southeast Alaska residents about their current feelings about -- and hopes for -- the
            future of the Tongass National Forest. Would Governor Palin be willing to comment on the
            following two questions?




            1. What does the Tongass mean to you?




           2. What do you see as the future of the Tongass?

                                                                 1

            I realize one could write entire essays on the subject, but a sentence or two will work
            best in this context. Thanks in advance for your time.
