 Hi Todd,

 If you have a minute, please review the menu that Stefani submitted for the week you're in Juneau.
 PLEASE feel free to make any changes or additions to it!!! The GOAL is provide you with meals/food
 that you and your family enjoys. If this looks good, great but if you'd rather have steak, baked chicken, or
 whatever just let me know.

 For the Foundation luncheon this is what she has proposed serving:
 .fresh halibut or rockfish on a bed of sauted green beans, snap peas, broccoli and wild
 mushrooms with a lemon vinagrette.
 .strawberry shortcakes.
