             She'll get you an answer today. She's in a budget subcommittee mtg now but can stop by to
             fill you in afterwards if you want.

              Do u think annette will be able to come up with anything on this? Funny now that others
             are getting perturbed about the leak- they realize the memo makes them look bad and they
             don't like that. (And that was the point I was trying to make earlier when I found out the
             memo was posted online). Leggies have the email now too.

               Absolutely outrageous and unacceptable if indeed it was a leak .   But remember the
              electronic snoop you had on MTA during the campaign. I surely hope that's the leak rather
              than disloyal behavior ( or incredibly poor judgment ) from a team member on what was
              clearly an internal, strategy-type communication to the troops from the CO. Surely your
              IT gurus (rather than just Sunny's supposition) could run the trapline? Either way,
              unbelievable.
