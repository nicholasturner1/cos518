  Hello,

  Before I have the tickets printed, I wanted to double check with you on a few questions. Should I put my
  cell phone number in case anyone has any questions? If I put the 465-3500 then I'd need to
  add something like contact House Manager or my name- with my cell phone number I can just list the
  number and no title or no name. Copy Express added the team logos... is that okay- I just submitted clip
  art with a helmet.

  Thanks,
  Erika
