        Governor,




       Walt just called me to report another fire on the North Slope at Kuparuk. The fire
       occurred in a ConocoPhillips Conex that was being used as a shop and storage area. We do
       not have details of how the fire started but it is being reported that the fire was small
       and was contained to the Conex. We learned of the fire from ConocoPhillips when they
       contacted the State Fire Marshall's office. They initially asked if we would like to
       investigate but later called back and requested the Fire Marshall's office participation
       in reviewing the situation.  They commented that in light of the recent fires, they wanted
       to be transparent.  We are sending someone to inspect tomorrow. DPS is not initiating any
       media.



       Mike
