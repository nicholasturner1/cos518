          MESSAGE:

          The village of Atqasuk is in dire need of a local grocery store.



          I have thought about owning my own business and would like to open up a local grocery
          store (if possible).




         Are there any grants available for me to apply for?




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0022821
