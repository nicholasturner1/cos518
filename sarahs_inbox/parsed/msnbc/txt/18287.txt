          Dear Mr. Weber:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.




          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

          Governor




          First and foremost THANK YOU for using the line item veto. In my opinion it is a good
          start! Use the veto early and often. As I view myself as a constitutionalist and a
          conservative, any reigning in of government is a good thing. It was refreshing to hear the
          news that you had vetoed such a large dollar amount from the state budget. Do not worry
          about making some citizens angry. For every one that is upset with your budget, two more
          are happy.




          Second point: Please reconsider getting rid of the jet. If the KingAir is in need of
          refurbishment, it does not make sense to put money into that aircraft when we already own
          a better one. Compare the performances. Please consider passing the KingAir on to another
          department (DOC?). Dont worry about the fallout, just explain the business considerations
          to the public.




          Remember, you are always welcome in my avionics shop.



          Stay strong!



          Paul D. Weber
