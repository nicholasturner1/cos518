  It would be nice to have a week or month set aside for to "Celebrate Alaska Native Women." it would be
  neat for Rep. Nelson and our Governor to put this declaration forward together and it is timely,
  considering Rep Nelsons retirement from the House. I bet Rep Nelson would like the idea, she is always
  so willing to do what she can to help. Just a thought. tj

           Rhonda,

           Rep Nelson is talking about the Fox Radio that you mentioned last Wednesday.

           Unbelievable how far these folks push the envelope. Fagan is included right in there.
