           Thank u. But I don't know why ktuu and ktva are totally ignoring the facts and are not
           believing us in the least. How can Ross claim it's "too late" for addl statments by us?
           That's unheard of.

           Also, Todd said adn had dates and facts very screwed up also, he did the best he could to
           correct Holland. The ktva correction on the dps budget should be made asap.

           Governor-



            I spoke to Mike Ross a few minutes ago. He wanted to confirm what I had told Channel 2
           earlier that no one from the administration pressured Monegan about Wooten. He
           specifically asked about Frank and Annette. Walt is going to name them on the 10.



            I told him that I would go on camera or at least do a phoner. I also offered up Frank and
           Annette.  He said it was too late in the editing process and they will uise your clips. I
           have tried unsuccessfully all night to reach Annette. I talked with her husband, left
           message with Rachael and called her hotel - no luck.



            I made it quite clear that Walt's accusations were total CRAP.
