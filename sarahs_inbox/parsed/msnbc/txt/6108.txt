               what a trip...
              how odd.

              I'm on a land line for a bit here in Dillingham, so can access emails once in awhile. thanks for
              the info given to Kris before i left - it's good reading! you guys put lots of work into that, and I
              appreciate it.

                Dear Governor Palin,
                You probably already know this. Yesterday Vic was in the Wasilla
                4th of July parade with his sign "Hard Working and Conservative".
                Today, for commuters, he was next to the Highway at Peters Creek with
                his sign, waving to drivers. Talis
