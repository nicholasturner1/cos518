                 i agree, and i need help in finding extra minutes in the day to get the word out on AGIA.

                 we really, really need to tap into others to pick up some of this. i can't monitor the talk shows and
                 keep up with what's being said out there in SouthCentral, so will need a lot of help in that area.

                 thanks. please let me know what everyone's solution is to this as I wade through a few other
                 issues regarding time constraints that I'm under with the budget, personnel issues, etc. i will
                 continue to try to carve out time in the day to more fully scan news clippings and try to catch
                 some of the talk shows via internet, but so far I haven't found even an extra minute to be able to
                 tune in to the shows unless I'm there in SouthCentral while driving in my car. i called in to
                 Carrigan's show, the Michael Dukes show, and dropped by Fagan's show yesterday, but can not
                 keep that up when I'm down here in Juneau.

                 we need to be aggressive on the public education aspect of gasline progress. we're getting killed
                 on the radio and in some print, and i need folks to really help ramp up accurate counter
                 comments to the misinformation that's being spread out there.

                 please help here and let me know who's doing what so i can rest assured this is being addressed.

                   As Kris said, she and I spoke about this. I think we do need to start
                   testing the waters and dipping our toes here and there to gauge
                   response and reward those who are encouraged about learning the truth
                   and disseminating it. I believe that we should give Eddie a shot - no
                   more information than revealed yesterday, but I do believe it's worth
                   it. Eddie and Ivan Moore work together on the show with Republican /
                   Democrat give and take. Ivan would be biased, but I believe fairly so -
                   and it's entirely expected in a format like this.
