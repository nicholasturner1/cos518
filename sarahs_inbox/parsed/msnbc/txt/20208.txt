              Dear Governor Palin, Commissionor Irwin and Kevin Banks and all Alaskans

              Many of us smaller oil and gas competitors are looking forward to the up coming
              meeting with Governor Sarah Palin at long last and we can not be more thankful for this
              historic meeting.

              Many believe the time has come to allow Alaskans to compete with the majors for more
              Alaskan oil and gas production and this up coming North Slope 2008 oil and gas lease
              sale is a smart time and place to start. America needs more Alaskans competing for
              more production of oil and gas and as Gov . Palin has indicated many times; more
              competitors in Alaska's oil and gas industry is desired . Let's make this happen and act
              now by granting the simply and reasonable changes found below for the up coming
              "North Slope and Beaufort Sea..NOTICE OF SALE ". It has worked in the past and it is
              clearly "tried and true"!!

              Gov. Palin and her many supporters have asked for more competition in Alaska's oil
              and gas industry for a long time. With our nation's oil and gas shortage and these record
              high gasoline prices may I suggest doing what has worked in the past when Alaska was
              the largest oil producer in the Nation. I believe in Gov. Palin's way of doing great things
              with tried and true methods. So now that we all agree with Gov. Palin's noble efforts to
              increase competition in Alaska's oil and gas Industry, why not act now?




              9/18/2009



                                                                                                                       PRA_GS PO1_0022586

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 2



               HERE IS WHAT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST.

               If the DNR DOG would act now by simply reducing the cost that of the upcoming oil and gas
               lease sales and go back to the $5.00 per acre as the minimum bid of the Cash bonus bidding
               and ten (10) year Lease terms and Royalty Rate of 12.5% on all tracts on all Areawide oil and
               gas lease sales until Alaskans see the benefits of having Trans Alaskan oil Pipeline filled once
               again.

              Alaska has lost 1.4 million barrels per day and if you figure that loss at $100 dollars per barrel it
              would help us all to understand what is a stake here. It is time to bring real competition back to
              Alaska as Gov. Palin has indicated.

               If this simply plan is granted then this way Alaskans and Smaller competitors will not be
               consciously priced out of the Alaska's oil and gas Industry. The facts to support Gov. Palin's
               call for more competition in Alaska are clearly on Gov. Palin's side.

              Almost all Areawide lease sales in the last 8 years have rarely received any bids on more then
              3% of the total leases offered that means millions of acres of State oil and gas go every year
              with no bids and not benefit to the State and all Alaskans-

               It is time to support this plan unless Alaska's leaders want to keep Alaskans and smaller
               competitors kept out of the exploration and production business'and let the "Major Oil and Gas
               Companies" continue produce over 95% and control most all markets. The Majors are clearly
               enjoying record profits while Alaskan's have been paying the highest gasoline prices in the
               nation, according to AAA on July 17. The small independents discover around 70% of all oil
               and gas fields in our nation why continue to price them and all Alaskans out of Alaska's oil and
               gas the business? See IPAA website.

              It will be a clear sign to many Alaskan voters before the Nov. Election where Alaska is heading
              if this simple request is ignored and not granted in my opinion. Please amend this Notice of
              sale to reflect these changes or please advise me on why this can not be done to better serve
              the best interest of the people of the State of Alaska, will you? Please see link to the "Notice of
              Sale", we are simply asking the Palin administration to amend this notice as stated above.
              http:/fwww.dog.dnr.state.ak.us/oi /productstpublications/northslone/nsaw2008/nsbs2008 notice.pdf

              I have a great deal of respect for Commissionor Irwin and Gov. Palin for what they have said
              about attracting competition for new oil and gas exploration and production Alaska! As you
              know time is of the essence, please act know so we know our hope is real!

              Please respond so we can help you make Alaska better for all it's fine people. I offer any help I
              can provide, just let me know what others and I can do to help you.

              This just came out. Thought you should see it since you will be in Fairbanks and could get asked. To save your
              time you can just read the summary. Comment for now - legal will have to review.

              Judgment issued by Judge Blankenship on 8/4/08

              Summary:
              The Superior Court ruled against DNR, deciding that DNR cannot require ARI to obtain a lease for its dock and
              moorage of the commercial vessels at this location on the Chena River because the state statute giving a preference
              right to a lease for upland owners was promulgated after the Binkleys constructed their dock over state shorelands.
              The judgment did affirm DNR ' s decision regarding compensation if we were to lease and the differentiation
              between requiring leases for commercial docks but not personal docks.

              Details of Decision:
              · DNR does not have authority to require ARI to obtain a lease for the dock and moorage of their vessels that are
              adjacent to their privately owned upland riparian property.
              · Because the preference right leasing statute (AS 38.05.075(c) and (d)) introduced "shorelands" in 1997 and AS
              38.05.126(c) and AS 38.05.128 were incorporated in 1999 and 1985 respectively, after ARI purchased land and
              developed the dock, the state did not until then expressly seek to prioritize the public trust rights over the common
              law rights of the riparian land owner to reasonably wharf out to deeper water. Unless expressly declared, statutes are
              not retrospective.
              · DNR could require a lease for other business' commercial docks if their riparian land was conveyed after 1997.
              · The state does not need a lease to regulate dock construction through the State 's general police powers.
              · DNR may regulate ARI's use of its wharfmg out right in order to prevent interference with public use of the river
              and to prevent environmental impacts on the river and State -owned shoreland.
              · DNR's chosen lease compensation method, which. includes a $0.25 per passenger fee, was not an abuse of
              discretion and did not violate 33 U.S.C. § 5(b) (which prohibits a tax on the use of navigable waters), and that it was
              a reasonable compensation method.

              Hello Gov. Palin.

             I will be arriving.in Anchorage Saturday night [8/9] and plan to start work on Monday
             morning the 1 lth. I'm in the process of finalizing the details of renting private office space
    I        in downtown Anchorage and hope to have that completed soon.

             Since we've never met, I would like to come by your office for a couple of minutes to say
             hi. What I have in mind is just a quick meet and greet, not a big deal, and not to talk about
             the case either. I just want to introduce myself and meet some of your staff. By then I
             should have my office location details and contact info ready for you. I appreciate your
             willingness to cooperate with me, and this informal meeting can serve as a good ice breaker
             for both of us. Can we meet, say Tuesday 8/12 ? [pick a time].

             Also, since my work is expected to take a couple of months, I think it would be a good idea
             if you could designate someone close to you to be my contact person to handle requests for
             information, and basically act as mission control between us in the event you are
             unavailable.

             I've heard it's rainy and cool up there, so it will be a welcome relief from our dry and hot
             weather here in SC.

             Regards-

              Hello Gov. Palin.

              I will be arriving in Anchorage Saturday night [8/9) and plan to start work on Monday
              morning the 11th. I'm in the process of finalizing the details of renting private office space
              in downtown Anchorage and hope to have that completed soon.

              Since we've never met, I would like to come by your office for a couple of minutes to say
              hi. What I have in mind is just a quick meet and greet, not a big deal, and not to talk about
              the case either. I just want to introduce myself and meet some of your staff. By then I
              should have my office location details and contact info ready for you. I appreciate your
              willingness to cooperate with me, and this informal meeting can serve as a good ice breaker
              for both of us. Can we meet, say Tuesday 8/12 ? [pick a time).
                                                                                                                                1.
              Also, since my work is expected to take a couple of months, I think it would be a good idea
              if you could designate someone close to you to be my contact person to handle requests for
              information, and basically act as mission control between us in the event you are

              I've heard its rainy and cool up there, so it will be a welcome relief from our dry and hot
