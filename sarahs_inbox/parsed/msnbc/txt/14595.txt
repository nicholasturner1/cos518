             Just catching up on a whole string of emails. I have been in meetings and quite a few have come through. It
             looks like Karen has sent the letter so let me know if you need additional information.

             I did get your message regarding Kelly. She is in the office today and I spent some time talking to her about the
             big items we have going (budget review, special session prep, and bill signings). I called Russ and made sure he
             knew he has the green light to get his move going as soon as possible. I also called Mindy and let her know that
             Kelly would be contacted her about bill signings, etc.                                '
