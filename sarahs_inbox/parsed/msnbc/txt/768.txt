Paula,



I was informed yesterday by the Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation that Andy Ruby,
council member for District 4, passed away in late November. He died at home of a sudden heart
attack. He was 48 years old. He is survived by his wife Sassa and 3 children.




I was wondering if it would be possible for the Governor 's Office to send a letter of condolence to his
family in appreciation of Andy's work for Alaska's commercial fishermen.




Also, we will have to start looking for a replacement for Andy. If you want, I can contact Robin
Samuelson @ BBEDC to see if they can come up with some recommendations.



Mike
