  Hey Frank,

  Cynthia was appointed to AWIB mid-term and her seat expires at the end of this month. She's inquiring
  about being re-apointed . She's an awesome supporter and brings a great private sector perspective to
  the board. Her number is Re- dQG}               I copied Todd because he knows her.

  Thanks,

  Ivy
