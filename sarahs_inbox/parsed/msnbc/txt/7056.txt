           I've been in touch with Griz also . I don't know him, but he's from the Valley and says he knows you? He's interested in
           serving on a board . I'll see what I can find , unless you have something in mind for him.

           Thanks,

           Ivy

           Nice to have a Man around that blows stuff up, sometimes, well almost always and,

                 Forever Griz
