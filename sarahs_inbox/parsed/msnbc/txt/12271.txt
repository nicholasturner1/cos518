             Governor, understand you are interested in the above . I am trying to set up a meeting this Friday or Monday with
             the Mayor, myself, my Deputy Commissioner of Hwys, and Gordon Keith my regional director (South Central
             Region) on the issue above.

             Randy filled me in on some of your thoughts. I will let you know how it goes. LEO
