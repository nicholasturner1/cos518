  Mr. Palin -

  I spoke with Warren Rowe this morning and he wanted to make sure that you have his contact info. Also,
  they would like to give your family a welcome package upon your arrival. Do you want me to ask him to
  deliver the package to your hotel room or do you want to pick it up when you arrive to the event?

  Below is Warren's contact info (best reached by cell):

  Cell: (907) 230-3437
