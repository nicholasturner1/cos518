          I thank you so much for pulling this together. You are a professional and giving person.
          Your name is so respected and we look up to you too. It was a educational and for me a
          emotional caring time in my life. We have Lorrie too and your mom was dynamite.

            Our Alaska Native Sisterhood Camp 2 sisters have been extremely busy organizing a
          Southeast Alaska Native Women's Conference that begins today ; $ 25 registration - there are
          limited scholarships! I am forwarding you a copy of the wonderful program for the next
          three days featuring speakers such as Florence Sheakley , Laird Jones , Ruth Demmert and
          panel : Alberta Aspen , Corrine Ragu and Micalyn Kunz McGhee , Iva Graywolf, Healing
          Ceremony, and a number of others. Iva will be speaking about suicide prevention. Hopefully
          our local Native organizations will allow interested staff to participate in this
          conference and support our local ANS Camp 2.

            The theme for the conference speaks for itself, "Making a Difference: Knowledge of Our

          dinner roll. Dessert too! Come and visit; bring those special people in your life;
