           Fyi -- see below. You could say a quick hi and welcome rather than a long statement.

           Hey Rosanne,




           Kelly is checking with the LG to see if he can make it.




          Sharon says it's totally up to the Governor, but there is an strong expectation for her to
          make the pitch - if she doesn't it would be very disappointing to the group. If at all
          possible, it's recommended that she perform the welcome - we could shorten it to two
          minutes of remarks with a couple for Q&A. Best case scenario, the Governor does the
          welcome.  As I mentioned, the LG has a full day and has left the building for good (unless
          the Gov calls him in for sure). Please advise on how to proceed.
