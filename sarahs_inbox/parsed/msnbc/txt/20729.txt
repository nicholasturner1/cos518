              We are so proud of you. All of Alaska is so proud of you. You hit that speech out of the ballpark - with only one
              hour to rehearse it? it was surreal for us as your staff to watch you on TV on stage with Sen . McCain ... like an
              out of body experience . We were in tears. God bless.
