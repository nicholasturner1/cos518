             J- it looks like the only way I could do this is to lv Juneau on sunday morning, then turn
             right around and head back that evening - can you confirm the exact time of the
             deployment- ideally the later the better be I'm scheduled to arrive Anchorage late in
             afteroon. Bob will check flts for me.



             Also if u want to note on sched I'm here at afn now for opening ceremonies.

             I'm thinking we should do this if you're in town. Will you be able to--I'm free to do it.

              Elmendorf.

              They will be boarding the planes at the Elmendorf Joint Mobilization Center.

              It would be an honor to have the Governor and the Lt. Governor attend this event and shake
              the hands of the Soldiers as they board the aircraft.

              Please give me a phone call if you need any assistance.

              Thanks,
