           Just watched the clip with Sharon. He talked about the steepening prices for gasoline.
           His solution is to increase domestic supplies, particularly by opening anwr. He blamed
           Congress for blocking previous efforts and proposals, and asked again for action on anwr.



            I gave Sharon some suggested talking points-they may have already resched you or will
           shortly.

            I believe he urged Congress to open drilling in ANWR. Will track down more info.

            Pls have them call my state cell and I'll do a phoner with them. And what did Bush say
           about anwr? Ask Joe what I should know before doing the phone interview. I do want to do
           it.

             Janice- pls note on sched when it takes place.

            Channel 11 would like a few moments of your time to talk about President

            Bush ' s comments this morning on opening ANWR .         They can come whenever you

            would like, Sharon said -- and Sharon did not let them know you were

            even going to be in today -- in case you don't want to do it.

            Kind of a moot point since we will soon have a new president and none of

            the candidates , including McCain , support the opening of ANWR.
