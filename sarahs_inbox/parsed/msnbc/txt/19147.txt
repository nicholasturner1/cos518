             I can't speak to the issues you mentioned, but there's not much happening in DC
             that week. Putting Congress aside, there is little pending at the
             Gubernatorial/ Secretarial level in the various federal agencies.

             Until we see the pattern of AGIA applications, I don't think that there's much to tell
             the agencies with pipeline interests. Even FERC is in a wait and see mode.

                Thanks. I do want to capitalize on my East Coast trip that week though. There
                may be other options hopefully.

                I understand that you might want my opinion on the advisability = of coming to
                DC on October 9th to meet with one or more members of the = Congressional
                Delegation.

                I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy. The
                congress will not be in session during the week of = October 8th, which is the
                Columbus day recess, and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                i WILL CALL kRIS AND Mike LATER today to discuss current = delegation
                relations and what we might do in response.
