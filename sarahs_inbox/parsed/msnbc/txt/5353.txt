                   The short, sweet answer on PPT is that you are not convinced 22.5% is
                   too high for gas. Members of your administration have said that it
                   may be--according to work that has been done to date. That's because
                   there is very little up-front investment necessary at Prudhoe Bay to
                   develop gas. Where the gas field infrastructure needs to be developed
                   (and can be deducted and credited), PPT may very well be OK.

                   On the second question: if the producers don't show up, we continue on
                   the path towards certification. We don't absolutely need to have
                   their gas commitments at the open season. Would the project be better
                   off and more certain to be sanctioned? Yes. But gas can be committed
                   to the project after the open season.

                   The $500 million isn't exactly a "gift". The partner(s) will have to
                   match us. But, more importantly, we will be getting partners on terms
                   that are worth billions to the State in the future. In a sense, we
                   are spending $500 million now to get $Billions later. Your Gas Team
                   will be able to demonstrate these benefits quantitatively in its
                   presentations to committees.
