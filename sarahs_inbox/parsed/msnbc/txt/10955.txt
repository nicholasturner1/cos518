              Let's both do run throughs - I've done a hundred of them it seems - but then again the
              lastest were while I was on the treadmill and way out of breath!

             I checked my Birchwood Community Ch. speech which was 3802 words and I delivered it in
             roughly 23 minutes. I don't think I skipped any major sections.



             Before wacking too much more out of your speech :) let's make sure how long it will really
             take. If you don't have time, I'll do a run through with it this evening to see where we
             are.
