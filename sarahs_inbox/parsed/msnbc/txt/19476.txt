           Subject:                Rd to Nome


           Leo- I've heard that there's been preliminary work done on the idea of building a road to
           connect us to our resources in Nome. True? That'd be great if it's true. What's the cost?
           We need to start building infrastructure- esp in areas where the residents truly want the
           roads. Pls give me a status report on Nome Rd plan. Thanks
