               Oh my goodness- I think that's the most stupid comment I've heard all year... his
               statement says it all re: his beliefs: "What the hell can we do...". ?     Nice talk, Mr.
               Speaker. Reflects well on your committment to ethical leadership.

               What was Harris thinking?!?!  How inappropriate!  It's a shame some think that we still
               don't need to work hard for Alaska and for Alaskans to trust us. The economy and resource
               development are important too, but upholding the highest ethical standards in state
               government is just as substantive an issue.

               Kelly said the governor expects ethics-in-government reform to resurface this year as
               there's a need to continue to restore Alaskans' faith in their government.

               "It seems silly to try and pretend as if it doesn ' t have a huge affect on how we do
               business as a state . To think that we aren 't going to do something about it legislatively
               is probably not realistic," Kelly said.

               Harris said the sweeping ethics reforms achieved this session were enough, and that more
               could discourage people from becoming lawmakers.

               "What more is there to address that wasn't addressed already?" Harris said. "I don't know
               what the hell they've been smoking if they want to do more ethics reform. I want to get
               down to some substantive issues to deal with the economy."
