          Dear Governor Palin,




          You and your family are a joy to read about, especially in today's world, that seems to
          hold life so cheaply. No doubt your precious TRIG has already positively affected many
          lives, born and unborn!



          Today we go to the polls to cast a vote for a potential leader of America . I could only
          wish you were one of the choices ! I would consider it an honor to cast a ballot for you.



          Shalom & blessings,



          Rae
