             Governor Palin Orders Flags Lowered for Former Territorial Legislator

             June 23, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today ordered state flags to be
             flown at half-staff on June 25 in memory of former territorial legislator Glen D.
             Franklin, who died June 17 at the age of 95.

             "Todd and I extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Glen Franklin
             during this difficult time.  We will continue to pray for their comfort," Governor Palin
             said.  "We are grateful for his pioneering spirit and public service during the state's
             formative years."

             Franklin represented Fairbanks for two terms in the Territorial Legislature. He served
             during the 1949 and 1951 sessions of the legislature.

             A longtime Alaskan, Franklin moved to Fairbanks in the early 1930s to attend the Alaska
             College and School of Mines. He followed up his schooling with a career in the mining
             industry and was partners in various mining operations throughout the Fortymile country
             and Yukon Territory. Over the years, he was active in Pioneers of Alaska and the
             University of Alaska.

             Franklin is survived by his second wife, Patricia, who was by his side when he died in his
             sleep last week, daughter Glenna and son-in-law Chuck Hutchens, stepsons and numerous
             grandchildren, great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild.

             State flags will be lowered Wednesday to coincide with a memorial service for Franklin in
             Fairbanks.
