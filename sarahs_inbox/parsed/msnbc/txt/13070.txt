               I agree with Therriault-I think Harris and Lyda are purposefully making this a difficult process.
               Unfortunate they can't just do what's right. You're awesome tho...



               Therriault explained his no vote on the Senate floor. He argued that it was inappropriate to include the
               capital items in a supplemental budget, which is generally used to cover unexpected expenses incurred
               over the course of the year. And he accused majority members of including the items in the budget,
               which covers fiscal year 2008, to make the 2009 capital budget look smaller.

               He also suggested majority members were deliberately not cooperating with the governor.

               "It just leads me to believe that there must be some other reason (for not putting the projects in the
               capital budget)," he said.

               Therriault said later he thought there might be some effort "to keep some members agitated at the
               governor," but wouldn't be more specific.

               On the floor, members of the bipartisan majority defended the bill by pointing to the savings elements
               and funding for certain programs.

               The five members of the Republican minority were the only senators to vote against the bill.
