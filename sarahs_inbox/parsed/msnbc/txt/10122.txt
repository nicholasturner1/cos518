               Sarah:   The attached article states that the U. S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the
              lower court's opinion overturning a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia. It would
              be very appropriate for you to instruct your Attorney General to file an Amicus brief in
              that case supporting the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right.    See you on
              Saturday.   WAR
