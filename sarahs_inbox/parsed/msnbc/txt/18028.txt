        The Fairbanks office has a timely issue they are looking for some guidance. The AGIA bill
        signing is the 6th and there has been some discussion about holding the Governor's picnic
        that same night. The picnic is usually later in the month but this year it is on a date
        that you are not available. Melissa believes that she can put together the picnic by the
        6th if she gets going on the planning right away. It sounds like you are scheduled to
        overnight in Fairbanks anyway, what do you think? Thanks.
