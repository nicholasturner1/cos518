         Totally understand . You have a multitude of other matters to attend to, and                        the EP
         strategy we've begun is not ready for a comprehensive briefing anyway .   Only                      reason I
         bothered you at all with a status is that I know this has been on your mind ,                       and that you
         are eager for progress .  So I wanted to reassure you that it is being worked                       hard,
         exciting conceptual progress is being made , and that whenever you wish , Tom,                      Marty and I
         can tell you where we are.



         Go get 'em in NY!

        It will have to be after my NY trip and squeezed in between other commissioner ' s request
        of me to start focusing on their issues , too - in addition to oil / gas/energy issues that
        some have perceived to be all-consuming of my office ' s time and attention . So... let me
        find the time before sp session and hopefully details will be ready to be presented and
        progress made on the state ' s energy plan soon . Thanks
