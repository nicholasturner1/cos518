              Governor - I just spoke with DMVA today on the arrival of General Casey. The General is
              flying on private jet to Ft. Wainwright (Fbks.) on Wednesday 12.12.07. The General is
              then late afternoon flying into ANC to meet w/Soldiers, Wounded Soldiers and Families. He
              will then fly out. His contact people said that he was only meeting with his soldiers at
              this time.  Thanks, Janice
