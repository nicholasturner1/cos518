                 Stat Alert - January 31, 2008
                The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has released Recent
                Participation in Formal Learning Among Working-Age Adults with Different Levels
                of Education (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/2Q08041.pdf). Based on data from the
                National Household Education Surveys Program, this issue brief finds that adults with
                higher educational attainment levels took part in work-related formal education or
                training than did those with lower educational attainment levels.
