            Re: Your comment on Don Young

            It is very important when one is under investigation that they make NO comment about the
            said investigation. For you to come out and say he " owes us an explanation" is totally
            inappropriate. He cannot talk about it. I'm very tired of the assumption of guilt
            whenever someone is under investigation. Especially for you to say this. Really too bad.

            Thanks for listening.
