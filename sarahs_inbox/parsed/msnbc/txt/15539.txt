                 Subject: SB 196 Prescription Drug Database

               Governor,
               Last Friday, we discussed a bill signing ceremony request from Senator Green's office for SB 196, the
               prescription drug database legislation. Due to timing and other factors , I wanted your final okay to let Ginger, staff
               to Senator Green, know that we will not be hosting a signing ceremony for this bill. It would be a courtesy call
               since they want to invite folks from out of state to the event.

               Thank you.

               Kelly
