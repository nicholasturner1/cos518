              Yes, governor. I'm working on remarks now. We have coordinated with

              Commissioner Notti -- he gave opening remarks at today's Anchorage

              meeting.



              We will have a draft of the NEA speech for you in the morning.



              Beth

              Sched says I'm speaking on statewide economic forecast tomorrow at noon

              to a group - is anyone working on that? Would the Anchorage office know

              of what the group is anticipating hearing? I believe folks from our

              office - or other areas of state govt      - have already spoken on the issue

              to different World Trade forums .   We need coordinated msg and don't need

              to reinvent the wheel.



              Also , Saturday ' s NEA speech I need to get sooner rather than later

              because they ' re a very tough crowd.
