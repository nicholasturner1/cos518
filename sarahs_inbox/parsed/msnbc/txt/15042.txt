            MESSAGE:

            Madam Governor,



            First of all congratulations on your new addition. As a parent of three school age
            children we have a lot in common. I included a message we sent to my legislative
            representatives back on March 23, 2008.



            Good Evening,



            Please consider supporting a rebate being paid directly to consituents vs conservation
            incentives thru industry.  My wife and I have three minor children and make 'what I
            consider a modest gross income of $55,000-65,000 per year. We can absorb heating oil
            price increases better than most because we have a wood stove and access to sufficient
            wood supplies.  Most people we know don't have a wood stove and live at/or around the same
            income level we do. If I had to heat my home with just oil our expenses would be $4,000 -
            $4,500 per year (with our thermostat at 62F). Now imagine that you make $35,000 per year
            trying to heat a small home/appartment? I can't afford to make weatherization
            improvements to my own home!-.How is someone making less than my family going to do it?



            With the notable exception of Mr Crawford you are all Republicans. I would suggest you
            would agree that individuals should be the arbitors of how money should be spent not the
            government.

                                                                 1
