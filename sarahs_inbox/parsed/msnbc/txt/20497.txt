           Governor -




           I just spoke with RNC. They. just confirmed up last evening the day slots for the
           speakers. As you noted in the Fox News article - You have been put on Tuesday, September
           2, 2008.  You have an approximate time of 9:00/9:30 p.m. Eastern Time. RNC feels that
           this is a much better slot for you and they want you on Primetime. They need you to be
           available 2 hours ahead of speaking engagement which would be 7:00 p.m. At that time you
           will have make-up done, go through final, etc. RNC will let us know when your rehearsal
           will be. It will either be Monday evening after you arriv
