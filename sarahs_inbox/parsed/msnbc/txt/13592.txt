           Sharon tells me that reporters are inquiring about our thoughts on the

          overall spending levels. There's still time to get a statement into

          tomorrow's papers, should we choose to go that route. Are you

          interested?

           So we ' ll need to be proactive in our budget message and get out in front

           of the critics ' message that you know is coming    ( from the leggies and

           our usual critics ): that WE grew the budget unsustainably , due to the

           operating budget increases , and that WE have no fiscal discipline. Let's

           try not to have to react to what ' s coming , but get in front with

           messaging while explaining increases , including tax credits. And

           explaining again our need to reign in their capital spending via

           sensible vetoes.



           Again though , can we veto anything out of that final operating budget?
