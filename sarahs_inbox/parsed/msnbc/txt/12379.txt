             Governor:



             Commissioner Von Scheben did tell me most of the funding               ( over a million

            dollars ) would come from the Denali Commission .               I can double check and

            get exact numbers for you on Monday.



            Randy

            Thanks Randy.



            It's a $1.3 million project, correct? And the state is only responsible

            to 20-30 percent of that with Denali picking up most of the cost?

             Governor / Commissioner Von Scheben:



             The Governor ' s office received a letter from the Mayor of Eagle and 4 of

             the 6 city council members .        ( Attached ) The letter reaffirms their

             support for the road improvements which includes the dust control work.

            The letter also says the Council has polled and found a majority of the

             residents of Eagle are in favor of the going ahead with the project. The

            news coverage on the issue seems to have greatly exaggerated the level

            of opposition to the project.



            I believe the Denali Commission         ( which is funding 70-80% of the work)

            would like to go ahead with the project.



            Commissioner .     Are there further steps to gauge local support that you

            would like DOT to take before moving ahead?



            Randy
