            Sheeesh. Glad he's having second thoughts about his decision to run again... tho he
            probably now feels he's. got nothing (else) to lose by trying to undermine a gasline.

            Dear Governor Palin,

                    I am in Fairbanks. I just spoke with Rep. Ramras in the street. In addition to
            expressing second thoughts about having decided to run for re-election he stated he plans
            to hold hearings around July 9. He intends to sit a state attorney next to Transcanada
            attorney and then have them explain how their interests may differ. In any event, he has
            hinted at this before and it is not news, but he seems increasingly determined to let
            everyone know he is determined to undermine AGIA.   Talis
