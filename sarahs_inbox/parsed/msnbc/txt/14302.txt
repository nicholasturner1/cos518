            Subject :                Fairbanks energy costs


            Remembered another comment from today as I heard a lot of ideas from residents about how
            to provide relief for high energy costs (I am not particularly endorsing any of
            these... just passing along citizen comments.)

            Here's what I heard:

            1. Why can't the state do something with the Healy clean coal plant to provide cheaper
            power ( Steve and Tom know those issues better than I)



            2. Why can't the state suspend the oil tax for a time on in - state producer refined
            gasoline in exchange for producer agreeing to drop price of gasoline.



            3. Raise local property tax exemption to 100000 instead of just 20K.



            4. State should fund Susitna Hydro


                                                                                                        Privileged or
            While these were observations from others, one point was driven home for me,..
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



            Is Pat G engaged in this discussion where tax revenues are being talked about? And, sure,
            feel free to pass to Tom, Steve...
