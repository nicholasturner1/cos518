            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your son . I was very impressed with your remarks about
            him.  You are a terrific example of motherhood and the unconditional love all mothers
            should have toward their babies . Your son Trig is indeed lucky to have you for a mom.



            Best wishes to you and baby Trig and congratulations to the rest of the family.
