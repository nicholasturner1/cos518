                                                 Governor Palin Signs House Bill 317

                 February 13, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today signed House Bill 317 into law.
                 HB 317 eliminates the limit on compassionate gifts that a legislator or legislative employee may
                 solicit, accept, or receive under the Legislative Ethics Act.

                 The bill was drafted in an effort to assist Representative Richard Foster, to whom a legislative aide
                 has offered to donate one. of her kidneys. Compassionate gifts will still be reported to the Alaska
                 Public Offices Commission to protect the public's ability to know how elected officials are
                 compensated.

                ""Our ethics reforms were never intended to prevent selfless gifts that could save a life," said
                Governor Palin. "Todd and I send Representative Foster our best wishes for a full recovery."

                 HB 317 passed the House and Senate unanimously and was signed Into law in Representative
                 Foster's office at the state capitol.
