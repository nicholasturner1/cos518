                 Subject: organ donor?

               Governor-

               Alaska has reached a milestone. More than half of Alaska's residents are organ and tissue donors.
               We are the only state to achieve this milestone. I was going to write a quick press release thanking
               donors. Just checking to see if you are a donor - if so I was going to mention it.
