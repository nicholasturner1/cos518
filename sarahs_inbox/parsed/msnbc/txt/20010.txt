            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I am writing to request that you DO NOT appoint Ms. Rachel Levitt as Permanent Director of
            the Office of Public Advocacy.



            I had professional interaction with Ms. Levitt regarding a



           CASA case which I was the appointed CASA to. After sending a, "whistle-blower," letter
           directly to your office; I was terminated as a CASA (without ever having been interviewed)
           by anyone from OPA. I tape recorded many of the conversations, and have sought, and will
           continue to seek proper address to the situation of OCS allowing a foster child to remain
           with an abusive foster mother.



           As Ms. Levitt has remained in Mr. Fink's position, I now write to voice and requet that
           she not be retained in that position permanently. There are many qualified individuals,
           who would serve your office with the true professionalism the OPA office deserves. I
           support you,and your efforts 110% Thank-you and take good care.




           all the best,



                                                                 I




                                                                                                             PRA_GSP01_0022142
