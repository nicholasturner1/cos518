                Kelly, do you have driving directions for this for the Governor in the event she goes today? I tried to look
                it up, and it comes back as Timberiane (not Timberland) off of Klatt Road?

                Was a time finalized?

                  Good morning -



                  Rep Craig Johnson just called to invite you to a going-away party for John Tracy this Sunday,
                  he'll call back with exact time.



                  Many many of the past employees will be attending so he wanted to be sure you were included.
                  It'll be held at Rep Johnson's home - since his wife has worked for Channel 2 News for 25 years.



                  Address: 12200 Timberland Drive (south Anchorage )



                  Kelly

                 Someone needs to. And to write something for public consumption that calls him on his lies.
                 Whoever wrote the flippin book could add to the explanation too.

                 I don't know directly who edits Fagan. I do know that when Zencey was on Fagan's show, Fagan joked about Zencey
                 being his boss and I remember thinking that Zencey was the editor of his work . But I apologize that I do not know
                 for sure.

                 So if he was set straight yet still printed lies, what do we do about this? Or does anyone want to
                 do anything about it to publicly set the record straight.

                 Subject Fagan

                 Had anyone called him to correct his lies about the Statehood book? I thought it was accurately and truthfully
                 explained to him that our office did NOT contribute to the book, that I did not have anything to do with it and had
                 never even known any advertising company was even writing it- I have never even read it!
                 He disparaged so many in this op-ed- and put the nail in his coffin in terms of credibility, in my opinion.
                    If he was told the truth about this issue when it cropped up on his show all week (as I was told it's been his topic
                 for a couple of days), and yet he still printed lies this morning, then this is more than the usual case of "Fagan
                 ignoring the facts" - this is another case of Fagan outright lying. We will call him on this, and we need to let his boss
                 at ADN know that they allowed another lying o -e                t    t
                   So, however we can deal with this- we shall. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
       i                  d or Personal Material Reda
                Privilege my opinion, this is another one that went too far because if he was corrected with the truth before he
                wrote this, yet wrote it anyway, I would think there would be outrage by folks who want to make sure were dealing
                in truth.
