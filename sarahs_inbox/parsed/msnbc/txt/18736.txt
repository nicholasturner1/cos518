          I will ask him for an overall progress report .   The work on the Unified System Operator
          study will largely be done by a contractor .   I know the RPF was issued last week. We are
          meeting with AIDEA today ( 10:00 am ) to go over their budget and I will ask for a work plan
          with timelines.



          Mike

          M- i'll need an update on Ron Miller ' s progress with AIDEA issues ( I've never heard from
          him in almost a year ), esp status report on $ 800g energy study that ' s now going on two-
          years being behind . Have him send me that aspect of a progress report today , it shouldnt
          take him long to jot an email letting me know what he's done to get the utilities to work
          together and present that study so I don ' t have to veto the railbelt energy funds again.
          Thanks
