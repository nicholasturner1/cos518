                I spoke with Antony following his round of talks with legislators (Gara, Kertulla, Wielecowski?,
                Gardner, Crawford, etc.) He spent a lot of time with Les Gara prior to that Minority press
                conference and I thanked him for us because I knew you and I both thought Gara's comments
                provided an open door.

                Just some background to factor in from Antony's visits (he says he briefed Joe B. and Pat G.):

                   1. Dems want to go to 30% rate; seem to care little about sticking to a gross ;" it's all about
                      the money" (Only Harry made noise about sticking with a gross, but what he really
                     wanted was a gross with credits.)
                  2. Dems also don 't seem to care as much for the minimum tax preferring to get more on the
                     progressivity (they're banking price will always be high).
