        Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES. Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
        Majority going to ask for a similar briefing. If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
        deafening, Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.



         Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
        "details" of ACES before going all in.
