             They announced yesterday their $1.5 billion, is my understanding. Tom/Marty, et al: is
             this already a public announcement?

             On another speech related note--the ADN has an article about how BP has reduced its
             spending plan for Alaska, will ENI's announcement come soon? I've only heard it's in the
             works, not when they'll make it. (Obviously, I won't talk about it in the FAI Chamber
             speech unless it's announced.)
