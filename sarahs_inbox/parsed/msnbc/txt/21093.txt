         It will have to be after my NY trip and squeezed in between other commissioner's request
         of me to start focusing on their issues, too - in addition to oil/gas/energy issues that
         some have perceived to be all-consuming of my office's time and attention. So... let me
         find the time before sp session and hopefully details will be ready to be presented and
         progress made on the state's energy plan soon. Thanks
