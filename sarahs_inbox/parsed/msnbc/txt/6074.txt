          MESSAGE:

          I, like many others, am very disappointed you vetoed the appropriation ($100.000) to make
          the Juneau City And Borough Paul Emerson Park disabled accessable.



         Why is it those who are the most needful and have the fewest resources and opportunities
         for a normal life are the first to punished by budget cuts?



         When you next enjoy outdoor recreation at the beach look around you and count the
         disabled,if any. I assure you there will be none at the Paul Emerson City Park at False
         outer point.And consider how many would have loved to spend a weekend camping with their
         friends and family at the Emerson campgrounds. But it wont happen because it is not
         disabled accessable.




         As a registered Republican for 53 years I have always supported fiscal restraint but I
         have never considered that it should began with those among us who have been left
         behind.And please dont cite the Senior Care program in excuse. That was done by the
         Legislation, and in any case as a 74 year old low income Senior who will receive the full
         amount($250.00) I opposed the grant as being excessive.



         There would have been little need for such vetoes if you had saved money by holding the
                                                                1

          Sesson in the state capital . It was such spending ( a jet plane ) that was the undoing of our
          last Governor , and if you continu to waste money with your " Capital Move" it may well be
          your undoing



          Respectfully , but very disappointed,
