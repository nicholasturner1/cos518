                  Subject: Read through results

                Good news!! I did a comfortably paced read through (yes, out loud) and came out at 18 minutes, even with the
                pause for our troops and at a few applause line junctures.

                We have a little bit of work to do on some missing words and a few minor grammar issues (I'll wait to see what
                you send back before fixing anything.)

                All in all, the read-through demonstrated you have a strong, clear and mechanically well-tuned speech. I like it
                very much!!

                You just about have to read it through all the way once without stopping to fully appreciate it. I've been so caught
                up in stopping at different sections that I didn't fully appreciate the whole-very nice product from a great working
                team. I'm thankful to be part of it with both you and Bruce.
