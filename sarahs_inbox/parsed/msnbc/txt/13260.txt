              Kris,



             Did June 28th get a final Yes vote regarding Sarah attending this event? James Shin had
             mentioned that if Sarah would attend, he would make arrangements for members of the Korean
             Consulate in Seattle to attend.



             Thank you, Kurt

             Kris,



             I asked Sarah if she was interested in attending a Korean Community golf event per the
             request of James Shin of Peters Creek Chevron. Sarah said she would like to attend if she
             was in town and to schedule through you. I found out from James today that the golf
             tournament is June 28th at Eagle Glen golf course on Elmendorf AFB.  I let James know I
             would contact you to see if it fits Sarah's schedule. Please let me know if it is a go or
             no go. My cell is 227-5483 and James contact number is 727-5183.



             Thank you, Kurt
