              Thank you SP- Alaskans sure appreciate you being " everywhere", esp on a day like this.
              Please thank Sandy for me, too . And Jay.



             House upped to 25%... lots of amendments on the floor though.

             Sandy and I went to two ceremonies on Ft Rich and I read portions of your proclamation.
             Jay is on his way to Palmer Pioneer Home and will read the same portions of your
             proclamation on your behalf. At some point about 300 warriors return to Elmendorf (within
             next three hours). Sandy and I plan to meet them. Hope your day is well--we remember you,
             Todd, Trak and family. Thanks for your guys' personal investment of your lives and that of
             your son.
