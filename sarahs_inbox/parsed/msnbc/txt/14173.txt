             Well I'm for it if an innocent child is tortured and killed... but I was very surprised at
             how "out of the blue" the issue seemed to be yesterday in committee.

             Dear Governor Palin,

                   In light of Rep. Chenault's death penalty bill the question has to arise, what is
             our policy with regard to the death penalty? Are we for or against it? Talis
