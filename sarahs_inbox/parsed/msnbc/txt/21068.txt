        I will.   Strange and pretty bold to email you directly with such a request.




       Also, I called the Mayor's office and spoke to Joy. I told her we recd a letter from the
       Mayor to the Governor that was addressed to Wasilla. I told her that the Governor works
       in the Anchorage office and should the Mayor want his correspondence expedited, he should
       send it to 550 W. 7th Avenue address ... and that I wasn't quite sure why the Mayor would
       have sent it there in the first place. I was very pleasant.



       Mike, a copy has been faxed to you. I'll check w/Tara but I believe she also sent to
       Michelle Fabrello.

       Dear Governor Palin,

                                                            1



                                                                                                         PRA_GSP01_0006240

         First, I want to thank you for all the hard work you are doing to

         make our great state of Alaska even greater. I can only imagine how

         difficult a job that is. So I have a humble request for you for

         assistance for my first grade classroom at Harborview School, right

         across from where Piper was in Ms. Winegar's class last year.



         Our class is studying renewable energy this year, and we are working

         on a bio-gas generator.        A bio-gas generator creates methane from the

         billions of microorganisms living in the digestive systems of,

         ideally, a ruminant.       Ruminants include cows, goats, or deer. Our

         class is using materials gathered from hardware and plumbing stores

         in Juneau to build a small generator in our classroom. When we

         started this project, I thought I could find goat manure in Juneau,

         but I have not been successful. So, Governor Palin, someone suggested

         that I turn to you.



         Since you are from the Mat-Su valley, a teacher here suggested that

         you or one of your staff who travel to Juneau might be able to bring

        me some cow manure from cows near your area for our project. We need

         at least two gallons, and perhaps more if it were possible. If you

         or a member of your staff heading to Juneau would be willing to bring

         this down in a timely manner, we would truly appreciate it. I also

         thought you might have fun being involved in a fun, hands-on (using

         gloves, of course) science activity with first graders.



         I would guess this would be an unusual request for a governor. Yet,

        you seem to be the type of governor that does not let tradition get

        in the way of rolling up your sleeves and getting the job done.

        Therefore, I thought I'd give it a chance and contact you.



        Please let me know if you would be willing to help us on this

        project.     I,   and my nineteen first graders, appreciate any

        consideration you can give this request. If you are NOT interested,
                                                            2

         knowing that would also be helpful.
