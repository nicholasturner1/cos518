             The ACES special session is right around the corner. Based on the success of the
             AGIA team, I've decided to utilize a large strategy team approach, that will be broken
             down into smaller teams to accomplish particular tasks or pursue special inquiries.

              I'd like to invite each of you to join the ACES strategy group. My current idea is to
              have the strategy team meet at least once a week up until session to compare notes
              and brainstorm necessary actions to maximize our chances of success.

              I'd like to hold the first meeting this Wednesday, the 26th, from 1-3. I'm in
              Fairbanks all week, so we'll do this by teleconference.

             Those in Anchorage can meet up in Suite 1820. The rest of us will dial in. I'll
             distribute an agenda and teleconference info late Monday evening.

             Please let me know if you can join us. Thanks.

             -Pat
