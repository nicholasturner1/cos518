           .No worries, boss.  We can go over the list in the morning and between Tibbles, myself, and
            Russ we can get the bases covered.

            Excellent, excellent, excellent.



            Only red flag is my calling legislators in short amount of time - they are notorious for
            cornering me on phone or in person to talk all over the globe about their issues, what
            we're doing "wrong", etc. I just don't want certain ones to go on and on about other
            issues while they have me on the phone.



            The rest of this sounds great. Thanks!

            Evening Governor,




            Tomorrow is going to be great. Here's the plan:



            1.   9:00 - 9:30. Tom, Pat, Marty and John Katz will convene a

            teleconference with staffers from the Congressional delegation (John

            confirms that none of the principals are available, hence them doing it

            instead of you). Drue will also be on the call.



            2.   9:30.    Tony Palmer is in Calgary expecting a call from you to

            announce the good news. Please go to Tom's office on the 14th floor to

            place the call. Tom, Pat, and Marty will be with you. Obviously feel

            free to draw from the attached opening remarks if you wish, or more

            likely, shoot from the hip.        You can't go wrong!



            3.   9:45- 10 : 45 (ish ).   You make courtesy calls to key Legislators. Joe

            is still compiling that list, but his method is to ask the leadership

            from majority and minority houses who " else " should be called; places

            the burden on those folks to do the line drawing. Joe will weigh in

            when he has further guidance.


                                                               2




                                                                                                          PRA GSPO1_0009306

             4.   10:00 : Tom, Pat , and Marty will be making the calls to the remaining

             four applicants .    With the press conference to commence at 11:00 we

            wanted to extend the courtesy , but did not want there to be too much of

            a gap between the calls and the conference, in case some applicant

            decided to immediately begin complaining to media          (unlikely, but

            possible ).    An hour seemed to be a reasonable compromise there. We may

            diplomatically request that the applicants refrain from doing so, at

            least until you have completed your press conference.



            5.    11:00.   Press conference.



            Sharon will run the show. As you do not like to go out there "cold,"

            Sharon will kick off with brief introductory remarks about the

            procedure, the topic to be discussed, and the order of speakers.



                                                                             Privileged or Person
            Then you deliver your remarks       ( draft remarks attached).

          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            You will introduce Marty , whose primary job will be to introduce the

            gasline team.



            Marty will turn it over to Tom , who will draw from key AGIA

            requirements, and tie those to Transcanada's application as having

            fulfilled them , and how / why that is so important to Alaskans, and

            Americans .    He will talk about 187 legal requirements       ( 20 statutory and

                                                               3




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0009307

             167 RFA requirements), and how TC met every single one, and why this is

             such a positive place for Alaskans to be right now.



             Tom will turn it to Pat, who will talk about what is next procedurally.

            Many folks' natural first reaction of may be, "You only have one? Then

             that means we can get right to the Legislature, right?" Pat will answer

             in more detail (than what you had had covered), that this is not the

             case, that due diligence requires a process, not the least of which is a

             60-day public comment process.



             Then, Q&A.    Attached is a list of expected Q's, with recommended A's

             (this is not for public distribution). The answers are concise, and you

             obviously can review them to decide which you'd like to hit versus which

             to turn over to Marty (Marty will be "lead" in answering questions, but

             Pat or Tom will step in when the spirit moves).



             I will bring copies of the public notice (announcing the comment period

             procedures), which staff can distribute with the press release. This

             public notice will be posted in the papers, and is being mailed to

             approximately 2500 locations around the state, every post office,

             library, tribal council, etc. It is attached FYI; you'll note that it

             is not a "routine" stark notice, but rather has a large, florid (Alaska

            blue-n-gold colored!) text window in the center, signed by Tom and Pat,

             which gives it a very colloquial and personal flavor.



             Then, high fives all around!
