            Oki But you see I did tell Sharon, right? I knew she'd get a kick out of like I did.
            Sorry ;)

           N00000000!!! Resist the urge!!



           I don't want leaks coming from me... to the governor...to you.... to her....



           I know it's fun, but...we need a pipeline of communication there and that

           leak would destroy. Thanks.

           Does he know I don't have a plane, and only rarely do I get to use DPS's

           turbo prop King Air?!

           Sen. Stevens was stuck in Juneau and was calling me this morning in an

           effort to see if he could "pay to charter the governor's plane" out of

           Juneau. Thought you'd be interested if he didn't get with you or your

           office on this. J
