              Yes, maybe we can set a time for you to talk to Joe while you are in Anchorage . A phone call can be arranged
              instead of a face to face meeting, you probably do not have time for that. I would like to do a follow up call with
              him as well.

              Corey sounds good.
              And I should talk to Joe, eh?

              Do you want me to close the deal with Joe Masters?

              What about Corey Rossi, do you want me to follow through on that appointment?
