           Governor Palin,



          I read in this morning's San Diego Union about the birth of your child with Downs
          syndrome. The article went on to speak of many of your accomplishments and activities. I
          just wanted to drop you a quick line and let you know that if I was an Alaskan, I would be
          very proud to support you. You appear to have many of the qualities that this country
          needs. The article also mentioned you as a possible running mate to Senator McCain. I
          would look forward to supporting that ticket. Good luck to you and congratulations on your
          new baby!!
