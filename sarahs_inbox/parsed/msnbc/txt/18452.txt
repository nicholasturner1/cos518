          Thanks Ivy!     Hope you are doing great!



          I'll pass this on to janice and we'll consider this Ketchikan request if we're needed in
          the area to conduct state business on that same day - i know we want to get there to talk
          about Gravina. I don't know how that works yet, with travels that combine different
          functions such as this.



          Are you liking DOA missions that you're on?
