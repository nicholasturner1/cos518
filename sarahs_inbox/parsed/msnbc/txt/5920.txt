        Yes.    She made the calls on Friday evening.

        Maybe Ivy had made the call of dismissal?

        Governor,



        He called the office today right before I headed over to the Mansion for the lunch. I
        just came across the note with his number on it and the message as I was gathering up
        things in my office for tomorrow's meeting.  He wanted to know why he was let go.



        I will call him tomorrow.



        Joe

        I assume Mr Willard is a former BAC member? He was on the news tonight, saying I shocked
        him when I made an abrupt call to him to dismiss him this weekend. Hmmmmm. I've never
        spoken to him - whomever called him - what was his reaction to the explanation I'm sure he
        was given when explaining the bd was to be replaced?
