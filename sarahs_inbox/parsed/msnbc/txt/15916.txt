            Vajayjay's surely not impressing his constituents, eh? Is that the best Fairbanks can do?

            Ramras was a jackass.



             He contended that if the legislature were a Board of Directors, this decision would be a
            slam dunk against.



             Galvin took exception, citing the advice of all our experts and in particular Goldman
            Sachs.  Vajayjay called the 3 days in Anchorage a propaganda effort.



             Thats where Dyson and Doogan came in.



             Off camera,    soon after in the hallway,       Doogan and Ramras had to be physically seperated.

             Just got home, turned on G2G... It's a re-run from today's committee mtg. Interesting
            questions, but what did I miss at 2:00 where Dyson and Doogan had.to apologize for his
            colleague's comment/question?

             And how did it go today?
