              See the note below about your appearance on the Charlie Rose Show.

              Andy will tape the show. There' s always a possibility that this will get bumped.
              But if it airs , we will have a copy.

             The interviews with the governors will be running tonight in the second half of the show.
             Arianna's interview will air at another time.

             Get this: the first half of the show is with Cate Blanchett - about her new movie
             "Elizabeth " - the very same queen Barbara K writes about in the opening essay of the
             issue.
