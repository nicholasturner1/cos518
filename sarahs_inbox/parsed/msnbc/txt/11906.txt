             After checking with the proper authorities it has been determined that Cora will get
             habitat!

              MESSAGE:

              Thank you for your action returning the Division of Habitat to ADF&G! While the previous
              Governor ' s decision may not have in actuality changed the review of development projects
              in sensitive habitat areas, there was always a question in a lot of people's minds about
              that. It's much cleaner to keep the Habitat Division in ADF&G. Thank you again.
