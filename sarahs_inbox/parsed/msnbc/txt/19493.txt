          Sounds great for Reeves involvement. This can be good.

          I think we could speed it up. Joe B. said DNR can provide maps of the

          state showing known and prospective mineral deposits, current

          infrastructure and roads, potential oil and gas finds, potential oil and

          gas pipelines, ports, etc.       We also need to know where federal land

          boundaries are so we can try to avoid environmental lawsuits.



          If it is alright with you, I would like to get John Reeves involved in

          this initial process of identifying projects and getting good

          descriptions for the commissioners to consider and prioritize.



          I think he has the time and I really like working with him.



          I can get together with him on the phone this afternoon and explain what

          we are looking to prepare and I bet he gets started right away.

          Leo is in a 6 hour managers meeting. I will follow up with him this

          afternoon on a response. Joe and I have briefly discussed the idea of

          getting Leo, Pat ,    Tom, and Click together the first week in September

          for a meeting to review road and infrastructure projects that could lead

          to significant economic development and jobs. The idea is to identify

          those projects where we can make a difference quickly, rank them, and

          then review with you and OMB and COS.

              BP sanctions Liberty development

              This morning BP said it has sanctioned development of its Liberty oil prospect, which is offshore northern Alaska in the
              Beaufort Sea.

              The $1.5 billion development plan for Liberty entails the drilling of six ultra-extended reach development wells from existing
              near-shore facilities at the Endicott satellite island under the Beaufort Sea to the Liberty reservoir, which is some five miles
              offshore the North Slope . The drilling would involve horizontal departures of 34,000 to 44,000 feet, requiring the use of a
              purpose-built rig that will be the largest land rig in the world, BP has said.

              Using the Endicott satellite island allows BP to produce Liberty without building a remote offshore island and pipeline
              infrastructure, thus significantly reducing the environmental impact of the new development . \u8232 ?First production from
              Liberty is expected in 2011.

              BP expects to recover about 100 million barrels of oil from Liberty. The company has said the reservoir is "high quality with
              wells capable of delivering 15,000 barrels of oil per day or more initial production."

              Liberty was discovered by BP in 1997, and is one of the largest undeveloped light oil fields in the BP Alaska portfolio.

              The BP-operated Endicott field is east of Prudhoe Bay. It came online in 1987 and was the world's first producing offshore
              Arctic oil field.. Endicott is linked to shore with a 1.5-mile gravel causeway.

             BP sanctions Liberty development

             This morning BP said it has sanctioned development of its Liberty oil prospect, which is offshore northern Alaska in
             the Beaufort Sea.

             The $1.5 billion development plan for Liberty entails the drilling of six ultra-extended reach development wells
             from existing near-shore facilities at the Endicott satellite island under the Beaufort Sea to the Liberty reservoir,
             which is some five miles offshore the North Slope. The drilling would involve horizontal departures of 34,000 to
             44,000 feet, requiring the use of a purpose-built rig that will be the largest land rig in the world, BP has said.

             Using the Endicott satellite island allows BP to produce Liberty without building a remote offshore island and
             pipeline infrastructure, thus significantly reducing the environmental impact of the new development. \u8232 ?First
             production from Liberty is expected in 2011.

             BP expects to recover about 100 million barrels of oil from Liberty. The company has said the reservoir is "high quality with
             wells capable of delivering 15,000 barrels of oil per day or more initial production."

             Liberty was discovered by BP in 1997, and is one of the largest undeveloped light oil fields in the BP Alaska portfolio.

             The BP-operated Endicott field is east of Prudhoe Bay. It came online in 1987 and was the world's first producing offshore
             Arctic oil field. Endicott is linked to shore with a 1.5-mile gravel causeway.
