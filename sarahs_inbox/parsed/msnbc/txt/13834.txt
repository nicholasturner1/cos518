           See below.     Here is a little bit of what may be expected for SB 245

           Friday at 1:30 Senate HES meeting .          At best they will pass the bill out

           in some form.

           teaching a class - but we can figure out what you need and I will do

           everything possible to assist as I can .            Just let me know, I go to

           Don:

           right now Commissioner Jackson and Dr. Butler will be at the hearing on

           Friday (along with me!). Attorney Stacie Kraly is in Anchorage teaching

           a class , but she could make herself available to answer questions if you

           need that.

           Let me know what is planned and whether we need Stacie to call in. I see

           it is the only bill on the agenda, so please let me know if that changes

           and other bills are added before SB245.



           thanks,

           -Sherry
