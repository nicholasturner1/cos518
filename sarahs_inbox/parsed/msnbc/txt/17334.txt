             Kari,

             I need about 30 minutes of the Governor's time Wednesday morning to record
             an interview with Energy TV. The answers would be pre-recorded and we would
             feed on the satellite. Does the Governor have time Wednesday morning?

             Thanks,
             meghan

               Energy TV would like an interview with the Governor and I thought this
               Wednesday might work - the questions are below. What we need to do is simply
               book the Governor' s time, provide the answers to the questions below, use
               the prompter and have her look to the side and answer the questions for use
               by the TV station. I just need help on the answers. It needs to be very
               conversationally written. Needs to be on 3:30pm Governor's feed Wednesday -
               could record according to Governor's schedule on Wednesday morning and would
               need answers by tomorrow. Possible?

               Thanks,
               Meg




               Energy-TV is an independently produced television program based in
               Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The show focuses on the energy sector,
               primarily oil and gas; it began broadcasting in October 2006 . Energy-TV
               currently airs in the cities of Calgary , Edmonton, and Red Deer, Alberta;
               it can also be viewed on-line at www.energy-tv.com.

               As of April 7, 2007, Energy-TV will begin airing in Houston, Texas on
               Saturdays at 1 Ia.m ., on ABC, with American content. On April 7th,
               Energy-TV will be the lead-in for the NBA play-offs. This first episode
               will be about natural gas; we would very much like to interview Governor
               Palin for this episode.

               The interview could take place at the Governor's office in Washington,
               D.C. and we would need approximately 20 minutes of her time. Given the
               scheduled air date, we would like to conduct the interview by March 28th,
               if at all possible . The questions we propose asking are as follows:

               1) Can you explain why your government is strongly supporting the
               development of the North Slope Alaska Pipeline that will carry Alaskan gas
               to both the U.S. and Canada? What would the economic losses be for Alaska
               if this project does not proceed?
               2) How important is the Alaskan gas to the future supply equation for the
               U. S.?
              3) Recently, the government of Alaska wrote into the Alaska Gasline
              Inducement Act, a capital investment of $500 million, for the successful
              applicant or group of applicants to reach regulatory certification. What
              was the reason for including the monetary incentive? Has the incentive
              been helping in the regulatory certification process?
              4) What progress has been made so far with the Alaska Gasline Inducement
              Act? How will that progress assist in the final outlook of the North
               Slope Alaska Pipeline?
              5) Even if the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act proceeds, what is the
              overview for the project? How long would it take for regulatory
              completion, construction, and tie-in?

              6) What do you see as the major stumbling blocks in pushing this project
              ahead?
              7) Is your government watching the Mackenzie Valley pipeline application
              in Canada to see what the best strategy is in dealing with so many
              stakeholders? If Mackenzie gets a green light, many think that it will
              open the north for both Canada and the U.S., and that the Mackenzie
              project will become the pathway for Canadian gas in the Canadian pipeline,
              soon followed by a U.S. pipeline that would carry U.S. gas. Is this
              statement correct? Why or why not?
              8) How would your project tie into Canadian infrastructure?
              9) Where would the final destination be for Alaskan gas?
              10) Is there anything else you would like to add for Energy-TV viewers?
