              Yes, sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I have a meeting today to discuss phase 2
              of the plumbing project and will discuss hooking the washer up and where the outlet is
              needed.  From there I can schedule the t-bed and washer at the same time ASAP. The
              basement outlet is already used for the dryer so that doesn't help-it's better long term
              to add the extra breakers to the 3rd floor as it's at maximum capacity. This was
              confirmed by the Facilities Manager and the electrician-so 3rd floor has most benefits to
              the House.  We're getting there-sorry for not keeping you in the loop on the status.

             Thanks,

             E

             E- don't know if you got my note by kitchen tv last wk, but I'm still wondering about sun
             bed and upstairs washer. Is there an outlet yet? Or should everything just get placed
             downstairs in basement where an outlet already is in place? I'd like to do something with
             both appliances soon so they can be utilized. Thanks
