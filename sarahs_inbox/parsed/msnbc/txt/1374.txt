   Ivy:

  In my opinion, capital construction dollars are a very important piece of the economic picture in
  Alaska. With the downturn in FHWA and other federal funding, it's imperative that we as a
  state keep our capital dollars whole; it's new money that creates jobs and, typically, new
  construction dollars reverberate through the economy 6-7 times. It also keeps our Alaskan
  contractors busy and gives us a place to put more entry level apprentices to work on projects
  now. We will need these people in future gasline construction as well as to fill impending skills
  gaps in the construction, oil and gas, and mining industries.                                               I

  The Department of Labor is fully engaged with the mining industry to advance registered
  apprenticeship and we are on our way to lessening the number of non residents in the mining
  industry.

  Commissioner,

  I read that Alaska's unemployment rate rose slightly this year, and that the national average is up also.
  What do you think is attributing to this trend? What is the state (DOL) doing to lower our rate? How do
  we get back near the 4,200 added jobs in 2006? Just wanted to check in and gather your thoughts here.
  If there's anything I can do to help (ie getting a message out to folks, etc) just let me know.

  I've copied Todd are he's focused on building our workforce like you are.

  Thanks,

  Ivy

  An estimated 24,243 Alaskans were unemployed in March, a noticeable increase from March 2007's
  estimate of 20,090. Alaska added about 2,600 payroll jobs from February to March. The increase
  was similar to the 2,700 jobs added in March 2007, but significantly less than the 4,200 added in
  2006. Over the course of the year, payroll employment was up 1,700, an increase of 0.6 percent.
  At the industry level, oil and gas continued to register the biggest gains with an over-the-year
  increase of 900 jobs.
