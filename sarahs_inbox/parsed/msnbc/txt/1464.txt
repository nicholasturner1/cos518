  Hi Sarah,
  We have not met yet as adults, but my mom stated that you babysat me as a child.
  My father was Charles Bumpus, the first elected Mayor of Wasilla. I'd like to add you to my
  professional network on Linkedln, and possibly get to know you better. I'm a big fan and
  supporter - you are an amazing, admirable woman who I look up to!
  Thank you kindly for your time and congratulations on your family's new addition - children
  are such a blessing!

  -Sarah E. Bumpus
