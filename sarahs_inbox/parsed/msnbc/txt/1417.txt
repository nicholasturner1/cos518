   Subject: Letter for John Faeo
   Todd,

   Here is the letter drafted by Michelle Fabrello in Juneau. I let her know you'd be making changes to it.
   I've also attached Mr. Faeo's obituary. Please let me know if you'd like me to assist you further in this
   (which I am happy to do). If possible, please forward me a copy of the letter you do send out, so that I
   can submit it to Michelle for records. Thanks so much!
