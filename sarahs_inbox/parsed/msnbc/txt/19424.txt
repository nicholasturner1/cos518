          No, it's an informal mix and mingle "grazing" event as Susan relayed to me. Also, the 6:30
          event at Liberty Center is for family also.

          Does the dinner start right at 7? The girls want to walk to            Macys in about 40 minutes.

          6:30 pm - 7:30 pm: Private tour for Governors of the new Liberty Bell Center (this is the
          only Liberty Bell Center event I've found in the program).



          7:00 - 10:00 pm: Centennial Celebration at National Constitution Center (all attendees).
          Mix & mingle w/dinner.



          Optional walking tour of the Lights of Liberty after dinner.



          Please let me know what time you'd like the car to be ready to depart.



          Thanks,

          Kris
