                Governor,

                You will soon be taping a video for the opening of the Miss Alaska (America) pageant (the pageant will take place
                July 19 in Anchorage ). Bonnie Faulk has requested that the picture of you as Miss Wasilla appear during the
                opening video; she feels it will be very encouraging to the girls and solidify the message that they can accomplish
                anything they Out their minds to. Please let me know if you are comfortable with the photo appearing in the video
                (Jason and Andy would manage it, so it would not be released to the pageant itself but would be contained in the
                video).

                I will wait for your approval before contacting your sister, Molly, for the photo (your mother's suggestion) - thank
                you!
