            I'm a'watchin'.     They sound like anti- conservatives , big time.



            Also, tonight- pis come over while Kerm and Tara are in town. 6:00-ish? And for the
            second time Piper will share bday cake with all of us, but she'll be in a good mood this
            time.



            I gave Erika a head's up that I'm having folks over at 6. (Pip may be able to invite a
            couple of her classmates over at that time too.)

            Subject: press conf




            Are you guys listening to the senate press conf? Stedman/Hoffma are getting drilled by
            Gregg Erickson.  "Would it be accurate to say the Senate Bi-Partisan Working Group doesn't
            have an overall spending plan?" All Stedman and Hoffman can say is they've saved more in
            08 than in state history. Alright, but what's your SPENDING Plan???
