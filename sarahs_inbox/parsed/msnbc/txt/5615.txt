             Subject: B&C update

           Health Council : I contacted all of the Health Council members. I think the last call to make is to Ed. His cell
           number is Privilege . Meg will send the press release when you guys give her the word.

           Regents: I've been contacted by the entire Fairbanks Delegation (minority and majority) and by Cynthia Henry,
           the one FBX rep on Regents. Interestingly, she was at a FBX Chamber Board meeting today and the
           appointment was a topic of discussion. Announcing at the meeting this week was a great idea, Governor!

           ALSO IN FAIRBANKS...

           LBC and Aviation Advisory : I have a few names to run by you for LBC-that seat is restricted to
           Fairbanks/Interior. Also, Jim Dodson represents the city and borough on the Aviation Board . Whittaker called
           Tibbles to say that he endorses his re -appointment. Mike was thinking this was a good idea. LBC and Dodson's
           re-appt could also be announced if you were interested.
