           Hickel (according to ktuu) is basically saying it's just a huge mistake and China's
           markets are the wave of the future. Should I attend that mtg with hickel?

           Governor, we hadn't heard of any request in our area to make comments about Gov Hickel's
           complaint and didn't hear the news. Non stop AGIA reading.     However,  as part of
           continuing outreach to Hickel, Marty and I met with Hickel and Malcolm just before their
           trip to China. At that time we asked if they would share what they learned when they got
           back.  They agreed and Marty and I are scheduled to meet with them early tomorrow
           morning.  We will share with you what ever we learn as soon as possible.



            Can anyone give a few word summary of the complaint so we know ahead of time? Thanks
           Tom

           It was reported tonight on ktuu that I wasn't available for the interview they requested
          today. I did not know they had requested any interview to answer Hickel's complaint about
          AGIA. If I wasn't available then perhaps an AGIA person should have complied with their
          request. No doubt I'll be asked by them tomorrow to comment anyway - so I'd rather have
          spoken to them today so we didn't have that "no comment" response.



           Also, Kris: are Joey and/or Kristan and/or DNR folks familiar with MatMaid going to
          respond to Samuels' and other leggies' audit findings of today?
