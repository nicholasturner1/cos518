             Could there be anything more ridiculous -- or tragically unaware -- than Hawker talking
             about "appearance of conflicts of interest and plain common sense and decorum in office"?
             These people are shameless.



             Speaking of which, I see Brooke Miles is stepping down. I probably shouldn't randomly
             suggest someone without clearing it first, but I'd be very surprised if anyone knows those
             laws better -- or cares more about them -- than 1privilaned   . Not sure he'd be
             interested, but it sure seems like a great fit for him, the agency, and the people of
             Alaska.

             No, despite what the paper said today, I would not be intersted in raising funds for Lyda,
             or Samuels , or Hawker .., or other elected officials.



             One "loan - of-my - name" was enough with Gene Therriault ' s request     ( the only request I've
             received to loan my name - from any leggie, R or D).

             Just fyi.
