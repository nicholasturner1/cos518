             MESSAGE:

             Honorable Governor Palin,




             I was born in PA and have lived in Sugar Land, TX for 15 years and I want to express my
             happiness and thankfulness that you supported prolife by loving your newborn son and
             realizing that all children are children of God. I applaud you for this and I will pray
             for you and your family. You are an inspiration to the many young girls who may be
             contemplating abortion.  Hopefully, your beautiful story will inspire them to give birth
             to their babies. So many people I know can't have children. My cousin's daughter had 4
             miscarriages and she is bedridden at 6 months with contractions (about 4 a day). Thank
             you for being a model to the prolife movement. I will keep your family (especially your
             newborn son) in my prayers. He has a mother that is very special.




             God bless you,

             Darcy Palatka
