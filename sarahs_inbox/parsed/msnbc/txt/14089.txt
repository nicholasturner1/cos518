           We could lv the Curves event on the 19th to get here the night before, if possible.

           Janice: Possibly- do u think king air will be available for travel back to Juneau for
          Gov's Prayer Breakfast in a couple of weeks? That may be most efficient way to travel for
          that event because I'm determined to allow the whole First Family to attend at least one
          event together this year, this one may be it. Thanks
