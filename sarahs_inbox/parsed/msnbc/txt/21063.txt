         This support is encouraging . They no doubt want the hybrid to lean more towards gross - I
         think they will be good to work with. Thank you Joe.

         Joe, Backbone had a good meeting today. I believe we are at consensus to support ACES,
        with modifications. Most I mentioned before, but with access and legacy field adjustments.
          I have been tasked with drafting a letter to the Governor to get approval. To set our
        position. We have done a lot of work to bring several legislators who were staunch gross
        advocates to come our way.... fyi...call if you want .... 230-1031. Out back east from 5-14
        of Oct..... thanks .... David
