                 Subject: Mayor Isaacson

               One main issue mayor isaacson is concerned with is getting $1 million in general funds for environmental work on
               Phase I of a railroad project. The project would realign track through North Pole and part of Fairbanks to
               eliminate about 18 railroad crossings. The railroad supports the project. It is Phase I of a much larger $300
               million dollar realignment, but can stand alone as a needed improvement from the larger project.

                 Subject : Steven Haagenson - AEA

                Governor,

               At the 1 /11 AIDEAIAEA meeting in your office we committed to vet and interview potential candidate (s) for the
               AEA Director prior to the next AIDEA Board Meeting . Separately Leo, Tom , Bruce , Emil and myself have now
               spoken with Steven Haagenson regarding his interest to head up the State's Energy Plan overseeing the AEA.
               His qualifications as Leo put it, would be difficult to beat. Steven is pumped at the prospect of ushering in Ygur
               energy plan for Alaska.

               While there are a few questions outstanding , all on the interview panel agree that Steven is the right person for
               the job . Wanted you to know that (my understanding is that) Emil or Leo are bringing up Steven Haagenson's
               name before the AIDEA board tomorrow to consider as director for AEA and the process is moving forward.
