             I've recvd this msg that they're in town from a couple of people. If they're available to
             meet sometime today before my 3:30 appt I could fit it in, other wise doubt I could meet
             them. I dont have their contact info. If you do, pls let them know it looks like today may
             be the most convenient time.

             It's wonderful that they're here: I'm working in the Anchorage office until 3:30 today,
             then heading back to the Valley. I can't attend their evening meetings - and I head back
             out of state this weekend before returning to Juneau. is there a minute they'd have
             sometime today?

             Good morning,

              Have been in the Harfouche meetings in Chugiak this week. They mentioned that they hope
             to meet with you while they are here. Had told their staff about our wonderful governor
             when they called before coming up. Have followed their ministry for years and highly
             recommend them. I expect they will have a powerful word for you and Alaska.
                                                                   1
