             I re-wrote in my words... I'm sure this is still a lot longer than they are expecting, so shorten up as needed.

             there were some things in the speech that were inconsistent with what we've found out the last couple of
             days of edits in the op-ed, so I incorporated those changes. joe and pat need to look at it one time to
             make sure its factual tho.
