                Subject: STATE BUDGET SURPLUS

                  I suggest that ALL state budget surplus funds this year be spent toward addressing the current
                unfunded state pension liabilities in PERS, TERS, and any other similar state-obligation pension funds.

                  We easily may not have a surplus in future years, when these unfunded pension liabilities can really
                come back to haunt us. Good financial planning, I suggest, means that we completely fund the state's
                pension liabilities while we have the surplus money to do so.

                  Thank you.
