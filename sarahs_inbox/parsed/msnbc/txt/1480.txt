Todd - would you be able to answer any of these questions for McNeil. I know the GOV has agreed
upon a 1-2 day trip. We need weights and also approx. weights for luggage, bedding, food. Then
you and the parents would do the 4 day trip. Janice

Janice,



There are quite a few details to work out for McNeil.



1.     Who is going?: At this point I understand that in attendance are:



Gov. Palin



1st Gentleman Todd Palin



Trigg Palin



Chuck Heath



Sally Heath



2.     Weight of each person flying (safety issue)

3.     The 25th is the chosen day for the Gov and Commish Lloyd - for the one day flight in & out?

4.     How long is the family staying

5.     How much luggage poundage?

6.     Who is taking care of the baby while the governor is at the falls?
