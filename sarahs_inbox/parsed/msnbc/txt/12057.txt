           I'm not sure who sandra is, but I've never assured anybody they could have an appt w the
           governor. I set up the mtg w lynne smith and mayor combs however last time he was in town.
           Please let me know what I can do to help-i'll call the mayor and let him know of the
           inappropriate phone call re: bill alien insisting to get in.

           Governor -




           We had a call today from Sandra Petterson with Bill Allen (City Manager-Palmer). Sandra
           stated that she was to ask for Ivy Frye as Ivy would guarantee this meeting request! Of
           course the front desk was amazed by this statement.




           Bill Allen will be in JNU tomorrow, Wed., 02.13 and Thursday, 02.14.08. Mr. Allen is
           requesting to meet with the Governor in regards to: Performing Arts Center, Transcanada
           Base of operations, and mat-Maid Property. I informed Sandra that the Governor's schedule
           was fully booked for Wednesday and offered that Mr. Allen meet with your staff
           assistant(s).  I was told that Mr. Allen wants the Governor only and that is the request
           put forth.  Janice
