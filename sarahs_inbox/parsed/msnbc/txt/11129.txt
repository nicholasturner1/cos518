                  Subject: Fwd: Complaints came in; abuse went on
                  Hello and FYI,
                  Enclosed is a link to the Anchorage Daily News article regarding the lawsuit filed by two very
                  young men; they endured sickening foster care and the death of another child in the foster care
                  home with them. May God have mercy. The young men are now suing for 10 million dollars,
                  their lives are permanently damaged, and I hope that finances ease their burdens and futures into
                  adulthood life. I was a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) and I was terminated from
                  my volunteer position, after I wrote a letter to inform the Governor, and explain to her, the abuse
                  I witnessed of a tiny-toddler in OCS foster care, and the lack of action; the 18th month young
                  child, was hit with a dish-rag, shaken, and threatened to be, " locked-away and put-away." No
                  one, to date, has done much. I was faced with a "pull- up-the-draw-bridges" reaction, which
                 included my suspension & termination (without interviewing me), lack of OCS making a sincere
                 and timely investigation , allowing the children to remain in the foster home at all times, an
                 intake report which was inaccurately / falsely documented, a police investigation thwarted by
                 OCS (" we will take care of it") a Pediatrician's statement to OCS, a month before my report,
                 wherein the Physician clearly states, " to remove the children from the foster-care home, no child
                 should be in that foster home," the doctor's warning and words were never heeded. The litany
                 truly goes on...I witnessed this abuse on September 10, 2007. After writing to the Governor, I
                 was told by OCS and OPA not to have contact with the boys while they investigated, as a CASA,
                 I was literally silenced. I have been passed from one individual to another, I have been slandered
                 by personal derogatory commentary made about me by OCS workers, the foster mother has been
                 protected, and my allegations were determined," unsubstantiated " (even though my husband also
                 stepped-up to the door and saw the shaking;" and other witnesses have seen bruises/ laceration
                 damage & inappropriate verbal commentary to the child by the foster mother). I can not
                 fathom ... why...I do not understand, in this day and age, why children still suffer at the hands of
                 " the system," and adults behave as they do. I do not understand how grown adults can have
                 more concern for their job / pay check, than to take appropriate action and to do the right thing. I
                 can not understand, " throwing a whistle-blower under the bus," or pulling-up the draw-bridges
                 on the truth. I learned enough from VECO to record my findings.
                 Children's health,safety and lives are the issue here; not files, covering malfeasance within
                 organizations, lies, disingenuous reports,egos,holiday time-off ,paychecks,passing-the-
                 buck,shutting-out,shutting-down, or swaying the Judges. I have witnessed, experienced,seen with
                 my own eyes .... a tiny child being hurt, abused,assaulted.... and no one, NO ONE, has stepped-up

                  to the plate to safely place the child and his infant brother out of harms way ( even though their Native
                  American grandmother desperately wants them). Today's news covers the story of the beautiful child
                  who died, and the money which others now seek. If you can do anything, to stop the silence and
                  condoning of our society's treatment of children, please do so. Why does the heartless, crime-
                  filled, unnecessary story still continue for yet more children?

                   STATE CUSTODY: Witness lists string of reports of harm.

                   From the time the boy was 6 months old, the state heard allegations that he was being neglected
                   or worse. But workers at the old Division of Family and Youth Services mishandled almost
                   every report that came in regarding the young child, and there were many.

                   Some they didn't investigate at all.

                   Those are the findings of a consultant who testified Friday on behalf of two former foster
                   brothers , A.J. and D.D.
