             MESSAGE:

             Dear Sarah, I want to wish congratulations on your new baby. Remember he is still a
             miracle from heaven, none of us are "perfect". I'm sure you will love him no matter what
             you may have to deal with regarding his health, imperfections make us all individuals. You
             are a very special person and God must have selected you and your family just for Trig.



                                        Sincerely

                                      Debra Campbell
