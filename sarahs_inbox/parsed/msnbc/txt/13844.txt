            Governor Palin:



            You're my dream of what real citizen -leadership is all about in the United States of
            America . I hope that John McCain has the good sense to ask you to join his ticket as his
            running mate this year. I can't think of a greater gift that Alaska could give the nation.



            Please find the time to come to California so that we can have the opportunity to know you
            better ...you're just the sort of leader that America needs and somehow it seems cruel that
            Alaskans have you all to themselves!



            I realize that you have to prioritize your time to reply to email from Alaskans but your
            biggest fan in the San Francisco Bay Area anxiously awaits a word or two from you!



            Fond regards,



            Kevin Elliott
