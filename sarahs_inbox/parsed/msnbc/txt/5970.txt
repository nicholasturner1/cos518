           I'll have Kris give you a re-cap, I wish you'd have been told it was open and they'd have
           loved to have you there.




           The board needs to accept VanTreeck's resignation that he submitted a couple of weeks ago.
           Wonder if they know he's wants to get out of there...

          I can not believe that I missed the meeting today! I assumed it was a

          closed meeting and nothing was mentioned yesterday about anyone else

          attending- you have no idea how disgusted I am!!!! This was the the

          climax to everyone's hard work and I was out mowing my lawn!



          I am assuming the Director's position will be filled shortly?                     All

          this information in the upcoming BAC meetings would be excellent

          information for the new director to have.



          Great job on the board appointments - I think my father-in-law was

          actually GIDDY!!       I have never seen that before!!!!!
