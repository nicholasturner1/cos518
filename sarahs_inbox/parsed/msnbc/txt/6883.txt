             Subject: Anch Gov's Picnic

           Kris can reschedule the Anch Gov's Picnic from July 20 to July 27 . NGA is July 20 in Michigan . Do you think
           you'll do your "family " part of Michigan before or after NGA? If its after NGA, the picnic on July 27 would not
           work. FYI the King Air will be down the whole month of July so we ' ll have to go commercial with whatever we do.
