             MESSAGE:

             Dear Govenor Palin,nnAs a life long Alaskan I understand the biological and
             politicalnarguments of both sides.  Those of us who have taken the time tonunderstand the
             issue know that wolves maintain a healthy population innAlaska. I fully support predator
             control to sustain healthynpopulations of prey species for the residents of Alaska. If
             thatncalls for using private aircraft to implement an economical predatorncontrol program,
             so be it.nnSincerely,nJohn Boohern10427 Holitna Cir.nEagle River, AK 99577
