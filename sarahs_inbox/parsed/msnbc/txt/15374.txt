              Monica, I'm waiting to receive more information on the attached draft document I received today from the
              governor's office, but wanted to know if Talis was aware of this proposal from the British Columbia government.
              Please see email string below (still waiting for appendices that are part of the agreement). Thanks. Margie

             Hi Margie,
             I've requested Appendix 1 & 2 from the British Columbia Government. Will forward as soon
             as they are received (hopefully today, tomorrow).
             Thank you again for your help.

                     Shelley, we need to also review Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 as referenced in the agreement (see para. 5
                     and 6 of the agreement). Can you locate those for me? Thanks.

                            Hi Jan,
                            The Premier of British Columbia has proposed establishing the Pacific Coast
                            Collaborative with the Governors of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and
                            California.
                            They would like the Governor's to sign the document at an upcoming meeting in
                            June, given they all attend.

                            In the meantime, I do not believe Department of Law has signed off on this one.
                             Can you please review and make any necessary changes.
                            Thank you for your assistance,
