               Sarah:  The attached article states that the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the
             lower court's opinion overturning a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia. It would
             be very appropriate for you to instruct your Attorney General to file an Amicus brief in
             that case supporting the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right. See you on
             Saturday.  WAR
