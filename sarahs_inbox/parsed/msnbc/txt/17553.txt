            Gov Murkowski appt Alan Austerman to serve on 2 federal boards and we had to have him resign before we can
            send nominations forward. These are the two boards we were thinking of for Privileged and Privileged o back
            when we were discussing the Board of Fish.

            Are you ready for some coffee?

            North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission: Submit one nomination. We were considering Privileged or
            Because this appointment comes directly from the president it could take some time to get the new person,
            appointed. Alan said it took two years before he was officially appointed. An acting board member selected from
            the Commission served until he was appointed.

            Bering Sea Fisheries U .S. Advisory Board: Submit two nominations. We were considering Privileged or Persona
            and Privileged or P One has to be a preferred choice. Travel and lodging expenses for this board can't be paid
            through a     ice of the Governor. Earl Kreiger in ADF&G manages a federal grant that is used for travel to
            board meetings.
