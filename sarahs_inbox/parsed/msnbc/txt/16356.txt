                Dear Governor Palin:
                I appreciate your support for the debt reimbursement legislation which you signed yesterday. This is so
                important to communities which must go to the voters for school construction projects, and will definitely
                benefit our community, as well as many others in the state. We are glad that this legislation extends the
                debt reimbursement eligibility for another two years.
                Sincerely,
                Carol Comeau

                Carol Comeau, Superintendent
