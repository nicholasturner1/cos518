              What's the deal with Don Tanner in a tv commercial (ch 2 news at 10) riding a snowmachine
              in the Mat-Su warning people about staying away from powerlines and saying they keep
              trying to get the state to fix its powerlines (lines sagging). What is he talking about
              with respect to the state not fixing the lines???
