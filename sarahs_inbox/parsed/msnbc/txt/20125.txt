           I apologize, the commissioner asked if they should be invited - he did not request.

           We are working to have a Governor Palin State Disaster Declaration signing in

           Fairbanks on Monday addressing interior flooding.         Already got Governor

           Palins concurrence.



           I would suspect that this should be a good media event, as Governor Palin

           will be doing it in Fairbanks.



           Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor appreciates her interest to do the event

           in Fairbanks.     Should the interior mayors be invited?

           Janice Mason is working schedule.   Your guidance on making this a positive

           media event is also appreciated.

               Good morning . I have been helping Rep. Meyer defend the resource rebate and motor fuel tax suspension . I gave his
               lead staffer some talking points last night to help Kevin carry these provisions on the floor today. Here are some
               additional points 1 will send.

               RESOURCE REBATE .

               [in response to a negative comment by Rep. Hawker]

               The policy decision of whether Alaska's natural resource wealth should be shared equally with all Alaskans and managed
               by the legislature as a public trust was made by the delegates to the Alaska Constitution nearly 50 years ago. Article 8
               dearly fixes that principle in place. Section 1 of Article 8 emphatically makes the statement that Alaska 's natural
               resources should be managed in a way that recognizes the collective interest of the people as the owners of the lands and
               resources. This strong constitutional principle of policy is reflected in the resource rebate.

               MOTOR FUEL TAX

               [In response to negative comments by Rep. Hawker]

               Alaskans, particularly fishermen and truckers are struggling with high energy prices and need some help. Some
               legislators are demanding perfection in the form of an iron -dad guarantee that the savings from suspension of the motor
               fuel tax will be passed onto consumers. Such a guarantee is an unfair standard to apply to any legislation. The
               competitive market will allow retailers to pass on the savings and those that ward to sell more gasoline than their
               competitor will pass most or all of the tax savings . At a time when Alaska is expecting an 8 billion dollar surplus at $120
               barrel oil for FY 09, the state is bringing in $40 million in surplus revenue from selling its oil every 48 hours. That $40
               million amount is roughly the same amount the state claws out of the pockets of hard working Alaskans paying for oil
               products for a year. There is no need for this tax right now and the only guarantee is that if we do not suspend the tax,
               Alaskans will keep having to pay it.
