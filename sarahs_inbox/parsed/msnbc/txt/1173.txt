MESSAGE:

Congratulations on your new baby boy. I don't know what kind of challenges you're facing with your
boy, but I raised an autistic son and I know there are times when you don't know if you can handle
any more. The wonderful blessing of kids with disabilities is the unconditional love they radiate. My
son is now 21 and has a job, but has never ran into cruel people and I feel privileged to have shaped
this young man's life.



He's one of four, but will always be special to me. Good luck on the challenges ahead of you and
remember there are lots of support groups. Again, I don't know what challenges your son faces, but I
will keep your family in my prayers. God bless you all.



Sincerely,

                                                  1                                ROSTON 02117
