          Does ray have connections, not just talking points, as                 ASMI gave the interview stating I'd
          be working with them to promote. I must take advantage                 of a NY trip and not expect to get
          to turn around for a re-visit back there any time soon                . Pls remind Ray of that . Kris can
          hook up w/Intl Trade folks if Ray doesnt have ideas on                this I suppose.

          Yes, we knew the grand opening was back awhile ago, but hopefully ray will hook us up with
          a belated visit there and anything i can do to promote our seafood there as long as I'm
          making that long trip - and couldn't make it the first time I was invited.

          Governor - Just spoke with Ray Riutta, Exec , Director, ASMI.  He said that the NY
          restaurant grand opening was a couple of months ago. He is going to call down to his
          folks and canvass the area to see what may be going on for the days of Oct. 8 through 10.
          He will get back to me shortly. Janice

          ASMI may have new requests if u could check with them. Maybe they's remember that grand
          opening invitation for the NY rest that features our seafood.

          ASMI reported that Id travel to promote our seafood. I remember reading that in an article
          tho ASMI hasnt talked to me about it. Maybe incorporating that into the trip? Id been
          invited to visit that all Alaskan wild salmon rest there in NY.

         ps:  One other thing occurred to me .  Since you will be in New York , you might want to
         consider making the rounds of some of the media outlets.




         We have talked about ways to disseminate the messages that Alaska is under new management
         and that we are ready and willing to provide domestically produced oil and gas to the
         nation. New York is the headquarters of most of the major media, and I think that there's
         a curiosity about Alaska and you as the new Governor.

         Until we see the pattern of AGIA applications, I don't think that there's much to tell the
