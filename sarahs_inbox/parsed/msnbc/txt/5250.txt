                   I wouldn't delete it but would advise the Governor that it may not be the best
                   use of her time and that there will be separate opportunities with Alaska
                   related press.

                      Chip Abernathy and Allison Nyholm have signed up for NGA and will be
                      available to support the Governor and Chief of Staff on Saturday and
                      Sunday.

                      Chip and I would like to attend the three meetings with the Alaska
                      Congressional delegation . The same for the meeting with Secretary
                      Kempthorne.

                      I think it would be useful for Chip and me to attend the meeting with
                      Secretary Bodman , which will include the gasline and other energy issues.
                      I am less certain about Kelliher. It may be useful for us to attend since
                      FERC has reached out to this office during the Palin administration.

                      The Mid-American and Exxon meetings are probably beat left with Mike
                      Tibbles . We can attend if the Governor wants us to, but we haven't been
                      involved in recent pipeline discussions with the companies.

                      In my experience , Alaska Governors have rarely paid attention to NGA
                      press conferences, which usually deal with cosmic issues . Instead, they
                      have preferred to deal with the media separately in a formal press briefing
                      for Alaska oriented media and in "bump-ins " at various locations.

                          that. I am waking to hear from Exxon about a meeting place on Feb . 26 at 2:30pm, but they are
                          trying to get a room at the JW Marriott.

                          John, please tell me any meetings you would like me to put your name on as staffing with Mike
                          Tibbles and the Governor, and I'll add your name. I told all folks as I made meetings that it
                          would be John Katz and/or Mike Tibbles staffing , so just let me know.

                          Please let me know if anyone sees anything that should be changed (even typos !) so I can fix it.
