           Another thing- dumb, but in case the Ear calls: one of Lyda's aides stopped me in the
           hall to say the building was getting a kick out of my "burnt toast" episode this morning
           that caused the fire alarms to go off for 20 minutes and caused an evacuation. She thought
           it was funny I was cooking breakfast in the capitol and burnt it.

           I assured her I was not in the building this morning, I was not cooking breakfast here at
           any time, and I did not burn any toast.



           She looked at me warily, I doubt she believed me. Just a head's up.

            Amazing out of all the shenanigans being pulled by lawmakers that he spun this up as a
           "wrong" on admin's part. Unapologetic is our stance, as there is nothing to hide from the
           public on our part, and critics should be asking what is it that any lawmaker is afraid of
                                                                  1

            the public knowing... hence their outrage that information was revealed to Alaskans.



             Comm Dept can catch this one if it looks like Wesley will follow through on his threat to
            write a front-pager.

             The guy was a real jerk and Heather Brakes as a witness was outraged.

             It was 9: 00 PM and I was working on trying to get a couple of things out

             of the Senate and he interrupted and asked a question about sending

             emails.    I told him it was appropriate and the administration contacts

             Alaskans all the time about issues that impact them. He asked a

             question about databases and I told him I would talk to him in the

             morning.    He acted like he had a gotcha, was very aggressive and he was

             threatening a front page story.



             We will get more information to him right away. I just talked to Nizich

             and he is working with the press office.



             Mike

             Mike- Wesley reported you had a "no comment" comment re: his question

             last night re: 30,000 biz lic addresses used to notify on biz lic fee

             legislation. Did you talk to him yet this morning to follow up? (He

             reported that you told him you'd be happy to talk to him in the morning

             about it .). The accusation is there was a violation of state email

             policy with the activity. He'll need clarification asap before that

             issue gets even more spun up . Pls let me know what Wesley ' s response

             was/is after you talk to him.
