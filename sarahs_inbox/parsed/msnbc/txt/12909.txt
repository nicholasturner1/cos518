                Dear Governor Palin, Yes, they are the primary counsel to the gas line team on rate making and FERC matters.
                Their two best known attorneys for us are Don Shepler and Ken Meinsinger. They are budgeted for 4.7 million
                this fiscal year although only $861,000 of that has been billed by them so far. They had been hired by legislative
                counsel before us about a year ago. Marty and Tom would be familiar with them. Talis
