           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin




           Congratulations and best wishes on the birth of your son. My wife and I are parents of a
           26 year-old Down Syndrome citizen. Our prayers are with you. We found joy in your public
           comments. The "challenging" part of learning about it is something we share although we
           did not know until a few minutes after Michael was born. However, your comment that "It
           just feels like he fits perfectly" has certainly been true for us and our other two
           children, both of whom are younger than Michael. I am also a geneticist and my wife and I
           have spent a lot of time helping new parents of these precious babies see what life is
           like as they move forward. Now that Michael is grown, he also helps in that effort. I also
           give presentations to groups called "The World Needs More Michaels". I am certain that you
           will come to believe that the world also needs more Trigs.



           David and Cindy Buchanan
