          Talked to kyle and conveyed you were sympathetic to the way he found out and that you had
          no intentions of springing anything on him or his constituents. He's pretty frustrated but
          the good thing is he ended the conversation by saying he'd stay out of the press for a
          while.

          Specifically, he's mad about a couple of things;

          1 he was caught off guard and found out via the press release

          2 the presser was sent at 5am and it has the appearance that it was sent at that time to
          catch natl interest

          3 he spent 4 days in skagway w dot officials who never once mentioned this to him

          4 the quote from dot in the press release that talks about the ferry system being a drain
          on the state (or words to that effect)

          5 dot requested ktn come up w cheaper alternatives to the current bridge project and ktn
          has beenworking on that request , then dot says the original bridge funds will be spread
          out across the state instead of staying in ktn-in sum , it was kind of like , if the money
          isn't going towards the bridge it could still be used on other projects in ktn.

          I have the sense he's most upset w dot, although he inferred he was upset by the way he
          found out-he would have liked to hear from the administration.

          I told him I wasn 't in a position to offer anything but I did sincerely apologize for the
          way he found out. I told him I knew you both before you were elected officials and I just
          want to find a way for us all to move forward on a positive note. He was appreciative of
          this. I told him I would convey his msg to you and that we'd go from there. He said he'd
          call me tomorrow from anc after I talked to you.

          Without knowing all of the ins and outs, he's pretty upset leo won't return his phone
          calls. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         ,Privileged or P ersona   a eria   e ae



          Atleast he's going to stay out of the news-i thought that was a positive

           step. Hope this helps!!!

          Ps me and bri are playing phone tag. I'm going to run out that way later today and try and
          find the girls.

          Russ- this is a nicer response than the previous one to you ... I apologize if anything
          came across as being defensive ! You guys are doing a great job as I recognize our full
          plates, limited resources and number of personnel ... I recognize that.



          And I apologize for my lack of patience in trying to get the word out regarding our
          intentions on the bridge and everything else.



          I appreciate this team . We shall have fun in addition to doing the best job possible for
          Alaskans , eh? Sorry for not sounding " fun" in my questioning of this roll out. We SHALL
          have fun , doggone it.



          Thank you guys.



          Pls remind Kyle how much we look forward to working with him to revitalize SE economies
          and industries . I've asked Ivy to touch base with him on this, too.



          And if we can get Bert to chill and hear us ,         remind him of the intertie and other pro-SE
          measures we're taking to help.



          Also, to all:

          Please don ' t hesitate to tell me when you have a "better way "         - I'll listen.

          Kyle was traveling until yesterday early afternoon.   I left a message for him first thing
          in the morning but he did not call back until about 2:00. I was able to reach Bert early
          in the morning and he even admited to me that he knew the announcement was coming two days
          ago.  Even though Leo made his comments at the Ketchikan Chamber and were covered widely
          by the news, they still argued that we were not clear. Bert restated this when I called
          him back yesterday afternoon.



           I talked to Mayor Williams yesterday and he requested a meeting with you preferably in
          Ketchikan but he said he could travel if that was not possible.




           Mike

           Mike / Russ / Randy : Holy cooly - Kyle Johanson ' s comments are as biting as Bert Stedman's
          were ( in adn this morning ). When did you guys talk to them - when the presser was first
          crafted on Monday ? Why do they say they were shocked yesterday?

           Bert didn't sound as angry as "shocked " when I talked to him yesterday , but even that
          surpsrised me because I'm assuming this was communicated to him at the beginning of the
          week.



           Also, as Sharon knows , the Stevens story grew legs NOT out of any " demand " I made for him
          to talk to Alaskans, as KTUU reported last night . When asked three times in two days by
          different reporters if I thought Stevens should talk about the investigation , I did say I
          thought Alaskans want to hear any information he can provide , and it ' s appropriate and
          deserved to give him the benefit of the doubt - and Alaskans get frustrated when he can't
          or isn't providing information on his innocence.



           It's very clear the adn reporter made my comments sound more inciteful than necessary. AP
          report was more in context , but the headline was rough . I'm not " demanding " Stevens do
          anything , just as I'm not "demanding " state senate leadership strip Cowdery of Rules - I
          won't tell anyone what to do and I don't have the authority to do so anyway. These
          questions have been impossible to avoid and I'll continue to give my opinion , but it's
          unfortunate the Stevens comment is made to sound more controversial than I intended.
