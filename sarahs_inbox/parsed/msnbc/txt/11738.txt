             Trying to preempt any fires if they do erupt on this by talking to Nizich. I'll have him
             contact you. And I'll keep reminding folks of my committment to native community, and
             disavow any accusationn of insensitivity there.

            Dear Governor,



            Brace yourself from an onslaught of criticism from the Native community.   A tempest is
            brewing across the state about the Board of Game appointments.    The main beef: that
            there's no longer representation on the board from an Alaska Native subsistence user.

            This will bring you much ill will, especially from Rural lawmakers who are now preparing
            to wage war over the confirmation of these.two appointments.
