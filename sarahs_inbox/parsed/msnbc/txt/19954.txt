           S- does ktuu know that the wooten divorce was quite awhile ago ... despite their insistence
           everytime they report on this that " she fired monegan while the trooper was going through
           a divorce with her sister "? Sheeesh, they haven't gotten it right yet . And even their
           forgetfulness that we offered WM another job to better utilize his strengths ... it's just
           so frustrating that they're playing right into lyda and hollis ' hands ., and vice versa.

              I prefer speaking to these reporters who want comments on the issue . I invite the
           investigation but it's obvious we could get to the bottom of it all if leggies and
           reporters would just ASK me further questions instead of spending $ 100g on a fishing
           expedition.
