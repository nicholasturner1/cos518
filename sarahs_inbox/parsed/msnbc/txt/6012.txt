         Here    is the update from our Public Health Director:



         "We should be able to work something up with DEC (they are the ones who

         monitor air quality, while we address the health effects). Also, we've got

         the smoke health effects information up at the top of the Epi website.

         http://www.epi.hss.state.dk.us/eh/wildfire/default.htm

         Julie--can we also make that a link for the Current Health Topics on the

         Public Health home page? Thanks. "

         Thanks!     And I just told Doug Warner I'd visit dnr/ag in palmer, so I'll do

         that after signings and fire briefing. There's lots of ash in the air - Tom

         and Karleen and Craig: I assume there will be a PSA alert about health

         impacts in this area with the ash?



         Kari: Also could u add on Sunday-      start of Frontiersman Big Lake Triathalon,

         11am in Big Lake.



         Also, before Saturday's baseball game I'm visiting "Alaska Grown" (local

         vendors) booths at the Anchorage Weekend Market.
