          very good John, I agree w all your points. They can name names, explain Fagan's not
          credible, and explain TS's great contributions. All your points can be incorporated, incl
          the rearranging of paragraphs/points. Thanks so much and pls review the final when they
          have it finished- I'll be out of email range today while in Barrow.

          I apologize for coming into this late. I agree with everything that has been said about
          the Fagan column.
