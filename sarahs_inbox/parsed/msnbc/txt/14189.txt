               Frank,

               Just one more item of interest about the BGCSB. At least four of us are Christians (Real Born Again Kind). In
               addition to us four Kevin Saxby (Dept of Law) is also a mature Christian. I'm sure this has a lot to do with how well
               the board works together.
