        Governor,



        I will work with Tom and Bruce today to get these points incorporated into the AO for your
        review and signature tomorrow.



        I will also get a summary to everyone today of the work the sub-cabinet and DEC have been
        doing on Climate Change issues.



        I am in Seattle today at an oil spill prevention task force meeting (Clean Pacific
        Conference ) but will be available to work on the AO and any materials needed for its
        announcement tomorrow.



        Thanks,

        Larry




                                                               1

          I will work with Bruce first thing in the morning to get a draft paragraph that can be
          evaluated for inclusion in the AO signing.
