         Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the
         Governor's office computer folks and they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had
         coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the time. They
         unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned
         back to the house. All of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend.
         I was told that the department of law had asked for this. Janice

         If anyone has an answer, pls let me know asap:

         I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House
         offices to get emails from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my
         bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were the reasons given and
         responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it
         was that this occurred. Thank you
