              Subject: Intent to Retire as Director of ABC Board Director

              Mr. Bailey - Later this week I intend to sent a letter to Governor Palin informing her of my intent to retire from
              State service and from my position as Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board on April 30, 2008. This
              will allow me to serve through the remainder of this regular session of the Alaska Legislature. I was appointed by
              Governor Tony Knowles and have enjoyed serving as the ABC Board Director for 12 years. I have informed my
              Board of my intent and give this notice with the desire to aid in the transition process to new leadership of the
              ABC Board. Under AS 04.06.070, the Director of the ABC Board is appointed by the Governor and serves at the
              pleasure of the Governor appointed ABC Board. It has been an honor to serve the people of Alaska in this
              important position of public trust. I will assist in every way possible to aid in the transition of the new Director. -
              Doug Griffin, Director, ABC Board
