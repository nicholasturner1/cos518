           Wish I would have known these were misssing, or even required. Does Russ or Lauren or
           Mindy know to do these requests? They've spoken (so have I) to Meyer numerous times on
           these.

            Studded tire tax is scheduled for Sunday!




            I'll get Russ a hearing request-hopefully he has the back-up that Suzanne is requesting.

             We do need the back up information for it . He threw it on Sunday ' s calendar and that is
            when we realized that we didn ' t even have a hearing request for it. Anything you all can
            get us would be good!



             Thanks!

             Suzanne,




            Thanks for the email . Like I said , I have a lot of respect for Rep Meyer-he's one of my
           favorites . I wouldn't reference his name without first talking to him about it.




                                                                  2

            Would Rep Meyer hear HB 106 if he received a hearing request?

            Ivy,



           Thanks for the phone call yesterday. We appreciate it. The funny thing is, I went back
          and looked at hearing requests that I have received , and we haven ' t even received a
          hearing request from the administration for HB 106.
