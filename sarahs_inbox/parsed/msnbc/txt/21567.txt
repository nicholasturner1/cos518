                   Subject: Rural Advisor - Rural CAP

               Governor,

               A few weeks back there was discussion about having the Governor 's Representative on Rural CAP be filled by
               the Rural Advisor / Coordinator position . Annette Kreitzer is currently filling the position and agreed that this
               would be the best fit.

               Now that we have Rhonda named , are you good with us moving forward to have her appointed as the Governor's
               Rep starting the beginning of the year?
