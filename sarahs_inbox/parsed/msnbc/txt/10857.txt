            Could u do that for me - cut and paste. I'm calling Canadian officals for the next hours.



            The policy is ridiculous and I'm disappointed anyone assumed the admin was all on board
            with it. I just don't have time to fix it - but her interpretation of IRS rules is odd on
            this one and I disagree with it.
