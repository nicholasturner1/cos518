                 According to Dan Saddler, Eddie Burke was on the Aaron Seilbrig radio show today, explaining that he
                 got fired today. Apparently, the oil industry was highly upset with Eddie because he kept playing the Jim
                 Bowles/Bill Allen phone conversation. He said Dan Fagan went to the station manager and said either
                 Eddie goes or I go, and I'll take all of my accounts with me.
