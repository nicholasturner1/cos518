          No- I am surprised it didn't come up during/ after our group chat with Larry Persily when
         he was talking about the emails on this subject.

         Sharon- did Mike or anyone give you a head's up this was coming, in case I was asked about
         illegal earmarks or any other aspect of Stevens' woes lately... In light of the Stevens
         issues we dealt with all last week I'd think whomever received the letter (to me) on Sept
         14 would have disceminated the info so we could be prepared to talk about it in the
         context of the Stevens issues we were already dealing with.




         Kris or Frank- did u get anything on this?
