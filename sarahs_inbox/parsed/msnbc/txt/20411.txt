                         Nellie Miller, mother of Mike Miller and the late Terry Miller, has died.
                         Last Sunday.

                         She has been in failing health for the past three or four years.

                         I don't have many details at this point The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner
                         will have an obituary tomorrow , I believe.

                         Besides being very active in the Republican Party in the 1960's through
                         the 1980's, she was involved with the City of North Pole incorporation
                         and subsequent affairs . Her husband was mayor for many years. Nellie
                         served (long, long time ) on the school board in North Pole before the
                         borough was formed in 1964 . She was pretty much the driving force
                         behind the construction of the first school in North Pole.

                         Nellie was a most interesting woman who had a very keen intellect And
                         political savvy. She was very, very proud of her two sons and daughter
                         Merry Christmas Miller. As you know, both sons served in the legislature
                         for many years. Terry went on to become lieutenant governor.
