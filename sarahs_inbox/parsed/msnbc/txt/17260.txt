           Boss,

           Wayne Anthony Ross is trying to get in touch with you. I am sure it is in regards to Privileged or Personal Mate
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

          Privileged or Personal Material Rel It sounds like the ear will have something on this Sunday. We may even see
           more on this later. Her approach is just confirmation that the decision was correct. You may run into WAR
           tonight but otherwise, I wanted to make sure you had the latest.

           Mike

           Anna: Would you please have Sarah call me? There are some problems with the Department of Law which she
           needs to know about and which I would rather not put in writing. I can be reached as follows:

           Before 6PM today at 276-5307 or
           After 9:30PM this evening at 346-2697 or
           Before 9:30AM on Saturday morning at 346-2697 or
           After 7PM on Sunday evening at 346-2697 or
           Monday at 276-5307.

           Probably the sooner, the better.

           Thanks Anna!
