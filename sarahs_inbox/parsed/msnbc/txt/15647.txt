           Governor-




           Just an FYI - AG Colberg interviewed with Channel 2 about same sex marriages. Also, the
           Daily News is going to publish the budget op ed on Tuesday. The editors chopped about
           half of the op ed saying most of the info had been covered in news stories. After much
           debate, Frank Gerjevic agreed to reinstate a good portion of it. I haven't seen the final
           version yet.



           Thanks
