          I am sure glad you feel this way!!!    I know we are not censored but as a courtesy I
          hadn't let you see my email ahead of time.



          We had to speak up immediately for Marty, our people and for what is right. We are
          getting great letters of support from Legis, David Gottstein, and Scott Heyworth. God
          bless.   Tom

           Governor Hickel & Malcolm,

           It is with extreme disappointment that I send this email. I am speaking about the
           BackBone III flyer you just sent to all 60 Alaska Legislators. And I know many other
           people share my indignation and disgust.



           It is totally inappropriate to imply that good government doesn't allow for differing
           opinions.  And it is totally wrong to imply that the Palin Administration isn't working
           around the clock to protect the State of Alaska, and every individual Alaskans' interests.



           We are a state that has amazing potential, with many options available to us. To suggest
           that choosing a gasline option that differs from your vision is somehow corrupt is so
           wrong.  And it ignores the reality - which is that we can do both projects! The AGIA
           project will allow an LNG option to proceed if there is market interest in doing so.
           Nothing in AGIA limits the LNG interests.




           It is beyond imagination and good taste that you have chosen to use individuals names as
           supporting your position without first getting their permission, or who are regretfully
           not alive to have participated in the AGIA discussion.



          Most of all, I am totally and irrevocably disgusted in the insinuation that Marty
          Rutherford or the Gasline Team has anything but the highest standards in achieving what
          this state needs, which is a fair, open and transparent process- In fact you have
          previously commended them for looking out for Alaska's interests. Now I can only that
          your definition of looking out for Alaska's interests only means doing what you think is
          best.

                                                        2




                                                                                                     PRA GSP01_0020777

           Finally, I believe a public apology to Marty Rutherford and the Gasline Team is
           appropriate.  They are the best people we could have representing this state.



           This a sad day,

           Tom Irwin
