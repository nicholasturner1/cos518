                Thank you and I do look forward to a response . She is serving the greatest
                role she will ever have .... being a mother. But how wonderful it would be to
                have her serve as Vice President under John McCain . As for a future
                woman President , she would have the best opportunity of anyone from any
                party.

                  Dear Governor Palin,
                  I was very impressed by your background and accomplishments . I would
                  also like to congratulate you and your family on the soon to be new
                  member of your family . I know the demands on your life must be great,
                  leadership of a state and shared leadership of a large family. As I
                  said, I was quite impressed after reading and hearing about you as a
                  person and as a politician . I know it is right at the time you are
                  having a child, but would you consider running with John McCain? I think
                  you and John McCain would make a great match for America . I also think
                  you could easily defeat any Democratic ticket . I am sure this will only
                  be read by one of your staff members . I still would be interested in an
                  answer though . Thank you so much.

                Specifically, It would allow
                American businesses that buy new
                equipment this year to deduct 50%
                of the cost of their investment in 2008 . The remaining value of the
                Investments would be depreciated over the life of the item beginning that
                year. The agreement also nearly doubles to $250,000 the Section 179
