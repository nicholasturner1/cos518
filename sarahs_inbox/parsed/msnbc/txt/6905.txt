               Ex-lawmakers charged with bribery, extortion

            Former state legislators Pete Kott and Bruce Weyhrauch have been indicted by a federal grand jury
            on several counts of extortion, bribery, wire fraud and mail fraud.

            Some of the charges involve the Legislature's consideration last year of a petroleum production tax
            proposed by former Gov. Frank Murkowski. Kott, a former House speaker from Eagle River, and
            Weyhrauch, of Juneau, both Republicans, are accused of accepting bribes to push positions favored
            by executives of a company that is not named in the indictment.

           Kott lost his Eagle River seat in the state House in last year's Republican primary. Weyhrauch, an
           attorney, did not seek re-election to his House seat representing Juneau. Both were among the six
           lawmakers whose offices were raided by federal agents last August as part of an investigation into
           corruption.

            Kott is scheduled to be arraigned in Juneau at 1:30 p.m. today.
