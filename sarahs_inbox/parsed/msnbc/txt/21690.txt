                 Governor,

                 I apologize that I cannot make the trip to Calgary as you requested. We regretted the event
                 two weeks ago as I was asked to commit to a leadership program run by the Aspen Institute.
                 I'll be in Colorado during the time of the Calgary conference.

                 The Calgary conference would be one for Tom, Marty, Kevin Banks, Kurt Gibson, or perhaps
                 Bruce Anders. These conference organizers like to see someone with a title so Tom or Marty
                 would be ideal, but the others could work too.

                 Sean
