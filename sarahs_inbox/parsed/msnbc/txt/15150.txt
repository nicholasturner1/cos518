            What's the entire content of huggins' bill? Certainly it had nothing to do with predator
            control because he stuck it to us with his non-support for that one.

            Governor, I have SB 306 (Huggins' Board of Game Regs) bill in my

            possession with a note on it that it must be signed by Wednesday.



            Also heard you are thinking of signing SB 170 (well-baby insurance) at

            the March of Dimes event this Saturday. Mindy, has this bill been

            transmitted? If so, we need it here in Anchorage ASAP. ( I don't see it

            in the bills that I have.)
