            As we were going down in elevator, Sean told me that the guy went into to Gov's office to
            request mtg and were told that we do not meet w/the business community. I need to ask Sean
            the person's name again, as I don't recall and he wasn't in office when I ck'd yesterday.
            He did not know if it was Anc or Jnu but I have a hard time seeing something like that
            being said. Regardless, I told Sean I'd follow-up.

             Kris,

             I just wanted to tell you again what a good job I thought you all did on the lunch. It
            concerned me that I passed along one negative query of a participant but failed to tell
            you that the other conversations were much better.



            I think it was good to do the lunch. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             In any event, I thought the lunch was worthwhile and could provide a real useful starting
            point. Thanks, again, for all the work on this.



             Sean
