                 I am writing today to encourage your support of HB-41. I believe that it is very important to
                 return the habitat division to the ADF&G where it resided for 50 years prior to ex Gov.
                 Murkowski's unethical move - unethical because as stated on the DNR home page:
                 "What we do: The Department of Natural Resources manages all state-owned land, water and
                 natural resources, except for fish and game, on behalf of the people of Alaska."

                 Sincerely,
                 Clark G.
