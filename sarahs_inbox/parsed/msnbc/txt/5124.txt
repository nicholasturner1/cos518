                  Subject: Joe, etc.

                You may already be aware but Emil met w/Joey today and talked about a couple of different opportunities for him
                within the department Emil was impressed and both were pleased with the meeting... he'll follow-up w/Joey next
                week on position.

                I'm going to put Steve Menard in the receptionist position at least temporarily. He's interested in it and DCED
                needs to get squared away before that would be an option. We'll see how it goes.
