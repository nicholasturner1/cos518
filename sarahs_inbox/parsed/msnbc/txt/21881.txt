                   Subject: Senate

                 Governor,

                 The Senate did vote to pass the bill but there was a notice of reconsideration given . That means that the bill will
                 need to come up again tomorrow for one more vote . We were thinking about sending out a statement tonight but
                 given the lack of finality tonight, I was thinking we should wait until tomorrow (after the final vote). Is this OK with
                 you?

                 Mike
