             Subject: B&C Appointment Reception

           Kris, I mentioned to Governor Palin last weekend about the reception for b&c appointments on June 29th. If you
           still want to move forward I will work with Jacob today and rest of the week on getting our appts. contacted.

           Just as a recap...

           We had thought each Palin appointment (approximately 75) and 1 guest could join us for an informal reception
           where we could hear what's going on the boards, put a face to a name in some cases , and to keep the
           appointments motivated to continue serving . Most of our appointments are on the road system and can drive to
           the event. The state will not pay for travel.

           Because this event is only one month away , I understand if we need to put it off until the fall or even next
           summer. It's a good idea, I think, to have this event but I want to make sure everybody is comfortable with the
           date and that it's executed properly.

           Who: Palin appointments and 1 guest, Kris and Ivy and any other staff that want to help
           What: informal reception , short welcome speech , and then meet and greettvisiting
           When : June 29 for 1 hour
           Where: Anchorage (location TBA, Kris had mentioned the AK Native Heritage Center)
           Why: meet appointments , keep them inspired and willing to serve

           ****Kris and Mike, Governor Palin also mentioned that she would be interested in having her cabinet and
           executive staff together some time this summer for a reception at her home in Wasilla . Perhaps this is something
           we can begin to think about.****
