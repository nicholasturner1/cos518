               The names below are carefully selected by ADF&G to balance the needs of the upper and lower river users and
               fit the statutory requirement of the Committee. The panel is comprised 8 members, 4 for the lower river and 4 for
               the upper river, of 2 of which must be AK Native non-profits.

               Recommendations for reappointment are for Shirley Clark, Angela Demientieff, Jennifer Hooper, Joseph
               Strongheart Sr., Mike Smith and Virgil Umphenour.

               Recommendations for new appointment are Richard Carol and Erik Weingarth.

               All names meet requirements to serve on the YRPAC and provide a good balance of historical knowledge of
               issues and new representation.
