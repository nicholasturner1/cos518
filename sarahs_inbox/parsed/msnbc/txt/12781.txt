           We can try other approaches with adn, then, like having it rewritten into Katz's words, or
           even Persily's. Then they can submit.

            Yes, the Frontiersman and Juneau Empire have it. ADN probably won't publish because your
            CON op ed was just published two weeks ago. I will do some checking and have an update in
            the a.m.

             Did the Earmarks op ed get sent to Frontiersman and all the other local papers yet? Is
            the ADN going to print it?
