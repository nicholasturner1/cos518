         I will ask him for an overall progress report. The work on the Unified System Operator
         study will largely be done by a contractor. I know the RPF was issued last week.   We are
         meeting with AIDEA today (10:00 am) to go over their budget and I will ask for a work plan
         with timelines.

         M- i'll need an update on Ron Miller's progress with AIDEA issues (I've never heard from
         him in almost a year), esp status report on $800g energy study that's now going on two-
         years being behind. Have him send me that aspect of a progress report today, it shouldnt
         take him long to jot an email letting me know what he's done to get the utilities to work
         together and present that study so I don't have to veto the railbelt energy funds again.
         Thanks
