               I         The corrosion issue is great politics, but difficult administration. The
              corrosion issue was already fixed in the PPT law by making the first $.30 per BOE capital
              costs non-deductible. This was in lieu of the corrosion costs . This is easy to administer.
              Instead, adjust this figure.



               §         The bill provides for more information sharing between DOR and DNR. This is
              good. However, the joint administration proposed is unnecessary.

              §         I recommend no changes because PPT was a great upheaval. Now, you should focus
             on stability to attract investments. Wait until 2011 before changes are considered.



              §         The economics of business investment are more important than government take
             and responding to corruption.



               §          I applaud the administration ' s efforts to beef up the auditing.



              §          Although the PPT and aggregation did not put Alaska in the category of a banana
             republic , another significant change would do so-especially for political purposes. It
             was 16 years since the previous major change . Wait until 2011. You don ' t have any good
             information yet upon which to make a dramatic change that will last for another 15 years.
