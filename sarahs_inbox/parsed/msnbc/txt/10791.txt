              I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State . I wanted to get you
              something for the 2008 speech before the end of 2007. Anyway , let me know if you think it
              is on the right track.




              I thought I would take a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow. On
              Wednesday , I thought I would have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry
              Persily help me fact check and test sensitivity and direction .  There are some items in
              the draft that have not been made public yet.   Two examples are Habitat and Health Care
              reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out.




              Last year ' s speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long . I tried to keep it shorter this
              time . This draft is now 3800 words , hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was
              shooting for.




              Happy New Year!




              Mike
