          Barbara Thompson has been in touch with Esther Cox and she is happy to extend the public
          comment period at the meeting on the 21st, so that all can be heard. She understands that
          allowing more testimony in lieu of conducting the work session on statewide correspondence
          programs is an option - as well as shortening the lunch time and trimming up the agenda in
          other places.




          Barbara Thompson has also been in touch with Glen Biegel today regarding public testimony.
          There has already been public notice on the meeting from DEED and on the AHEA website.

         Lynne and Mike: this is the issue that has erupted in controversy - I have not been in the
         loop until hearing the rage of some expressed on talk radio about this issue this week.

          The Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development is going to have a one hour work
          session on September 20th on statewide correspondence schools.    It is an information
          session for the board with presentations by several State Department of Education
          personnel, and an opportunity for Board members to ask questions and to discuss.       It is
          not the intent of the Board to hammer out any modification or eradication of regulations
          regarding statewide correspondence.   Therefore, we are not asking for any participation
          by members of the pubic.




          The Board is on a tight agenda, and we shall be sticking to the time allotments as closely
          as possible.   There are any number of issues before the Board, and each one deserves full
          time and consideration.




          There will be time to       testify at the beginning   of the meeting as always.    Testimony from
          interested parties on       any agenda or non-agenda   item is encouraged ;   however, again time
          will be an issue . it       would be helpful if your   organization would select two or three
          people to testify who       would represent the home   school community.




          Thank you.
