          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin:




          I read about you with interest in the past, but when I recently saw your name mentioned as
          a VP possibility, I thought, "How Perfect!"    From what I can see your conservative
          credentials are good, certainly better than McCain's. You would draw many of the democrat
          women who are angry because Hillary didn't make it.   Most importantly, your country and
          those of us who love it, desperately need someone like you on the national, scene.




         I hope you will actively pursue and ultimately attain the office of Vice President of the
         United States.  Who knows what could happen after that.




         Respectfully,
                                                               1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0018904
