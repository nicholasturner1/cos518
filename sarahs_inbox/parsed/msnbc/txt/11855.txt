            Governor-



            We would like to send this out tomorrow:




            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                       No. 08-XXX




           Governor Palin Orders Flags Lowered for Former Lawmaker



           February 6, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today ordered state flags to be
           lowered to half-staff in honor and memory of former State Representative Bernard Bylsma,
           who died February 2 in Arizona with his family at his side. He was 85.



           A memorial service will be held Thursday, February 7, in Surprise, Arizona, where Bylsma
           lived for the last 15 years.  A second memorial will be held at a later date in Anchorage,
           where Bylsma will be buried alongside his first wife, Billie.



           Bylsma was born August 27, 1922. A longtime Anchorage businessman who owned Turnagain
           Chevron, Bylsma was elected to the Alaska State House in 1980 and served one term,
           advocating successfully for bike trails in Girdwood.



                                                                    1

             "Todd and I send our thoughts and prayers out to Representative Bylsma's family during
             this difficult time," said Governor Palin. "We are grateful for the legacy of his family
             and for his selfless service to the State of Alaska."



             Bylsma is survived by his second wife, Jennie, who lives in Arizona; 11 children -
             Darrell, Doug, Glen, Marlene, Dan, Charles, Eileen, Joan, Jeff, Brad and Krystal - and
             their families; six stepchildren - Betty, Bob, Rick, Kathy, Leann, Mark - and their
             families; 32 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.



             State flags will be lowered on Thursday to coincide with the day of the memorial service
             for Bylsma in Arizona.
