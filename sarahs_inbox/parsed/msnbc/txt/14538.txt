           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on your new baby .  You have entered into a new world with your bundle of
           joy.  I had a son Brock James on January 3, 2007 , who was born with DS . He and his sister
           Amber have brought so much joy into my life that words can not describe .  I have met so
           many families with open arms and have learned alot through them .  I always say now that if
           there was some miracle pill , I would never change my little man . He is perfect just the
           way he is . Congrats again , and god bless you and your family.
