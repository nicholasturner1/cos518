         Kris, Kari

         Pls set up a lunch or dinner with any\all former AGs. I've wanted to do this

         since my election:

         1.   It will fascinating to get them in one rm for a historic event.



         2. I don't believe we've properly welcomed AK's newest AG to state service

        yet, or perhaps have not had the fitting "welcome" for Talis that he

        deserves. I look forward to doing this for Talis - and to having the

        opportunity to meet the former AGs.



        Either Anch or Juno or wherever is most convenient.



        Thank you!
