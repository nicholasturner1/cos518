                 Dear Lt Governor,
                    In my Eastern Civilization lasses I learned that it is customary for a good host to welcome a Mongolian
                 President by first consuming a large vat of lard in order to hasten the swallowing of large quantities of buttermilk
                 before consuming a large meal. Happy meals The ever watchful AG
