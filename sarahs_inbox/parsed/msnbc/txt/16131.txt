           Governor - I received a call from ConocoPhillips - Jim Bowles office in ANC. Jim Mulva
           will be arriving ANC today, Monday afternoon and would like to stop in to see you for
           approx . 30 minutes . I asked the subject matter and it is more a greet as he has not seen
           the you in awhile and will be in town. Mr. Bowles will also be accompanying him. Joe is
           aware of the meeting and said he is also available to staff you.



           We can either set for this afternoon 2:00 p . m. after the ExxonMobile meeting or tomorrow
           Tuesday before the 2:30 p.m. Wall Street Journal Interview.



           I also wanted to say thanks for sharing your daughter. I hope she had fun this weekend
           and does not have too many stories to tell ... Fuller's and Jace flew back home this a.m.
