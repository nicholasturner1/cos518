              Dear governor palin. Two issues. First he wants my dept to help him force his colleagues
              to force dept annual measures to be done. Second he wants law to force dept of transport
              to follow legislative comments on priorities as the will of the people. His letter also
              involves two broader concepts that he probably would not agree with. First he wants law
              to sue his colleagues on the first issue and then he wants law to enforce the will of his
              colleagues when they agree with him on the second issue. Privileged or Personal Material Redacte

              Dear Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles,

                     It would appear that Sen. Dyson is determined to stir some things up. We will work
              on a draft response. Talis
