            The Honorable Governor Sarah Palin

            Office of the Governor

            P.     0. Box 110001

            Juneau ,    AK 99811-0001




            Dear Governor Palin,



            We are writing to ask you to urge the Senate and House Resources Committees to hold
            hearings on two important bills: House Bill 74 and Senate Bill 238. Both bills would close
            a dangerous loophole in existing statute that allows mixing zones , zones where regulations
            allow a body of water to exceed water quality standards, in spawning streams.



            As commercial fishermen, we depend on Alaska's clean water to produce healthy catches of
                                                                    1




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01 0013534

            salmon, halibut, and other fish. As a commercial fisherman, we work to protect fish
            habitat.



            Fishing families depend on the purity of the Alaskan lakes, streams, and rivers. In 2005,
            salmon harvesting and seafood processing in Southeast Alaska alone supported 2,847 jobs
            (USDA, 2007).  Commercial fishermen in the region earned $92 million while seafood
            processors' payroll was $38 million (McDowell Group, 2004).  Alaska's clean water ensures
            the purity of our fish and enables it to command high prices in world markets.



            The cities of Homer, Soldotna, Juneau, Wrangell, Port Alexander, Tenakee Springs, Pelican,
            and Yakutat, the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and the Kenai Peninsula Borough have all passed
            resolutions opposing mixing zones in spawning streams. Furthermore, numerous fishing
            organizations, including the Alaska Trollers Association, United Southeast Alaska
            Gillnetters, Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association, and United Fishermen of Alaska
            have passed resolutions or submitted comment letters against DEC's proposed regulations.



            Protecting spawning streams is good for business. Please encourage the House and Senate
            Resources Committees to hear this bill.




            Sincerely,




            Paul Barnes
