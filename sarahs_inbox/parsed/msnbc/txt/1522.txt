Hi Todd,



Thanks, you did a wondeful job; I appreciate that you're willing to do things like this- as crazy as it can
get!!! These kinds of events seem to always take on a life of their own.



I'll contact Comm. Bishop, if you haven't already done so and let them know that you had an
unexpected change in your schedule.



The event will be televised on 360· North- the Legislative coverage channel- from 7-10.



Thanks for putting up with everything, you really are a great host!!



Erika
