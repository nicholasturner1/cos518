                 Subject: Kenai River Regs




               Just a note to confirm my office filed the Kenai River regs today (containing all but the 2010 ban ). Thanks for
               working diligently to wrestle with a difficult issue and bring something forward that prior administrations haven't
               been able to get consensus on.

               PS-I assume the commissioners will handle whatever notifications need to be made in their spheres of influence-
               -Board of Fish and local governing entities immediately come to mind. And, Tom had indicated he would handle
               press. I briefed Senator Wagoner 's office. That's all for now.
