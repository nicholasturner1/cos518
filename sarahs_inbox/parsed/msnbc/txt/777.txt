  Todd,

  I'm meeting with Randy and Linda tomorrow morning to review the Foundation Bylaws, to increase the
  membership for the gaming permit. If we can increase to 25, let me know if you have anyone in mind.

  We'll schedule a meeting tomorrow with Jeff Prather of the gaming group section of Dept.of Revenue, so
  we can begin moving forward on that.

  I'll let you know how the two meetings go, and if it's all "do able" then we can send out the email and have
  the members vote.

  Thanks,
  Erika
