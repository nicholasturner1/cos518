            Subject:                 Delayed


            I'm delayed again in Seattle - the coonecting flt's already gone. Won't get in til 8
            tonight, via milk run. Checking on other options, perhaps flying to Anchorage instead of
            waiting here til 3pm to try to get a seat on that next Juneau flt.



            Pls announce Steve anyway today. Have him say a few words after an intro by any DNR folks
            who may be available? If no one's around then wait til tomorrow, tho I hate for press to
            know I was out of town for a day and couldnt get back in time for scheduled Juneau
            committments.
