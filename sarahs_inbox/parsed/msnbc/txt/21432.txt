             Karen,



             We no longer have the confidential docs from the cabinet meeting. However, the one slide I
             asked OMB to prepare is one that I expressly requested for the purpose of my talk tonight
             to an economics group at UAF. To my knowledge there is nothing in it related to our budget
             deliberative process--it's all public info. Do you (or governor) see any reason why I
             can't use it tonight. I'm happy to make clear it's something I requested your shop prepare
             rather than something your group independently put out there. It will be on the
             projector--I won't have handouts. Ok to use??
