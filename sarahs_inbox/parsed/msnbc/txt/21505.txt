             From a reporter friend of mine ..."To me this bill is like a lady w/out a prom dress. In
             this case the progressivity and tax rate are the prom dress ... I'm just not sure what we've
             accomplished here mr. Chairman." - sen. Wagoner said to sen huggins. I love it!
