              You're right. I talked to her about Workers' Comp but she said she couldn't do it. We went with

              you gave her the insurance adjusters position on a board, i thought.
              she's married to JD Daniels, who is VP of Northern Adjusters. I'm sure you talked to her,
              as JD stopped me at the ball to explain their reasons for not being allowed, legally, to let
              Susan accept the position

                Great! thanks

                Also, did you know Susan Daniels can't take the board position we gave her, due
                to conflict of interest? They researched it, found it couldn't work ... did she notify
                you of that? Maybe you told me already and I forgot?

                    Nice job, governor! You picked some great board members. I hope you
                    made
                    it back to town--the weather is ridiculous.
