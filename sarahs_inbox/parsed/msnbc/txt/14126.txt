            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

            My husband, Bill Heumann, and I appreciated meeting you at Tom Stewart's Celebration of
            Life. I thought you might be interested in the Alaska History & Cultural Studies course we
            have developed for HS students at www.akhistorycourse.org. The web site was developed with
            a grant from the US Dept. of Ed throughSen Stevens' office to the AK Humanities Forum.



            Best wishes on your upcoming "blessed event."



                                                                1
