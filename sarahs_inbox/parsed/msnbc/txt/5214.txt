                  Your name has been forwarded to the White House with a request that you be
                  invited to visit our troops at the earliest opportunity. John Katz has been
                  in contact with the POC and between he and/or I, we will let you know as soon
                  as a date has been selected. They are very excited about your interest and I
                  am confident that you will get an invitation in the near future.

                  Hi Commissioner:

                  Just letting you know I'd still love to honor our troops with a visit
                  overseas whenever it is apporpriate and convenient to make the journey.

                  It was good to get to chat with you this week in Juneau.

                  Keep up the good work, thanks for everything.

                  Sarah
