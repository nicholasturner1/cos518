           MESSAGE:

           Our local paper, The Sacramento Bee, had a write up on your new baby. Your husband's
           comment "well, why not us?" was soo appropriate and right. Taking your precious baby to
           work is also soooo appropriate. People need to work on their priorities. It is obvious
           that you and your husband are right up their where you should be. Again congratulations.
           You go girl:
