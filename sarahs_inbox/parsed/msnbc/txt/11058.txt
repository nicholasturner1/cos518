             Bruce is coming over to our place tomorrow morning (Saturday) beginning at 10 a.m. for a
             few hours to nail down the accuracy of the factual statements in the state of the state.
             We have the draft you sent at the end of the regular work day today. If you noodle on it
             any more tonight or early tomorrow let us know. I expect we'll have it back to you by
             midafternoon and you should feel it is stabilized once again from a factual perspective.



             Tell me what you think your word count target is, please. It's at 3095 as you sent it to
             us, I believe.
