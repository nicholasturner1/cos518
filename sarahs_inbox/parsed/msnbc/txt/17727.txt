           Kris,

           This is to notify you, that I regrettable will be leaving the Office of The Governor. My last day will be May 18, 2007.
           After a great deal of thought and consternation, I will be moving back to my family in MN. I will miss you and this
           office a great deal. It has been my pleasure working with you. I admire and respect you so much and will miss
           seeing your bright and beautiful face. God has so blessed me with you and the governor in my life. I will be
           eternally grateful.

           May blessings for you during this journey,


           Mary A. Havens
