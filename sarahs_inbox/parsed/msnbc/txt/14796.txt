            MESSAGE:

            This message is personal for the Governor, not on the list of subjects. Please forward to
            her.  Thanks.



            Congratulations, Governor, to you and your family on the birth of your new son Trig. I am
            the parent of a 21-year-old boy with Down Syndrome, David Wohl, and he is the light of our
            lives.



            He was the first of our three children and, as someone very wise told us when he was born,
            "he will remain innocent longer" - and that has turned out to be the deepest truth.



            Again, all our love and best wishes to you and to your family,



            Martin Wohl
