              Importance: High

              The Senator is "very enthusiastic" about the opportunity to stand with you and talk about energy and
              your solutions to the crisis.

              Here's the "run of the show" at this point:

              Aaron Saunders says that yesterday, the Senator spent 20 minutes outlining his plan and it went way
              too long. They would like for it to be closer to 10 minutes today . The Senator would be honored if you
              stood next to him and then spoke for a couple of minutes before opening it up to reporters.

              Your comments, Governor, could mirror that which Kurt and I drafted and I sent earlier and attached
              again above.

              Aaron is emailing be the Senator 's speech so that you are fully aware of what the Senator will be
              saying.

             They believe that just the two standing togther will be news enough and should attract many in the
             press - they would love a press release heading out from our office inviting the press. As Aaron said,
             the Senator could talk about "wallpaper" and the media would show because the Governor is there
             with him.

                                                                                                               Page 3 of 3


               He did say that white there have been a few bumps (earmarks, in particular), the Senator thinks highly
               of the Governor, is supportive of the Governor, and likes what she is doing, especially regarding
               energy, including the debit card plan and now the $1200 energy rebate plan.

               I'll get working on the media advisory right away with Sharon . Governor, please let me know what you
               think of the revised comments. And then I'll begin preparing a press release for release just after the
               press conference.

               Many questions today might be centered around the fact that you are standing together, but I think if
               you stick with "perception versus reality " theme, that would be great . " I've always enjoyed a fine
               relationship with the Senator and it continues to grow stronger. I look forward to continuing to work
               together with him during this time . This state is stronger with the vision and ideas of our leaders
               combined."

               The press conference is in the federal building. Stevens' staffers are inviting media to his office and
               then escorting them to the FAA conference room on the 5th floor.

               Aaron wants to remind you that the Senator' s plan is not set in stone; he will continue to work on it as
               he gets back to Washington, DC and takes more feedback from Alaskans.

               Thanks,

               Meg
