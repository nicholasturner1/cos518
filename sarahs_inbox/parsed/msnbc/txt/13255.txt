             Dear Govorner Sarah Palin

             Hello, my name is Tom Cashin and I am from Franklin county which is in Western
             Massachusetts. I have to say that I have never been to Alaska and my infuence does not
             reach beyond my home county but I have heard about you recently and I have taken a keen
             interest in your achivements as well as your popularity and I have to say I was deeply
             impressed. I have also heard that certain people want you to run for Vice President with
             John McCain but I think otherwise. I think you are to talented and to savvy to run for
             that post. Instead I think that you should run for President of the United States in 2008
             or if you can in 2012. I know that you have your own agenda and probably alot on you plate
             after having a baby (which shares my birthday of April 18) so I bid you farwell by saying
             that no matter what disicion you make I'll still support you.

             Republican Thomas J. Cashin jr
