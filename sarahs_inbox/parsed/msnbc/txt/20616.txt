                Mr. Van Flein, I received your message and will follow through with your request , but before I do I just question
                the "all members of the Office of the Governor to preserve all records ' there are clearly members in this office that
                had no involvement or knowledge regarding the termination of Walt Monegan . So before I forward your message I
                would like to talk to you briefly about this. Thanks.

                Dear Mike.

               At my direction, please inform all members of the Office of the Governor to preserve all records, above and
               beyond what normal state protocol may require, for the duration of this. investigation or until we say otherwise. It
               will be our job to determine what privileges may apply, and by asking that this information be preserved, I am not
               implying, nor do I want it inferred, that everything will therefore be made public. As you know, but not all may,
               know, there are a variety of privileges that control the dissemination of.this type of information and each
               document, should it be deemed relevant, will have to be combed through for executive privilege, attorney client
               privilege, work product, deliberative process privilege, spousal privilege, privacy, and even the context of
               separation of powers will have to be weighed in reviewing this information. Thank you for your assistance.
