              Hey Sharon:

              I agree, some of the posters are rude in their comments.

              You've got a good idea about clarifying. You know, I went to the very spot where the governor saw the
              bear and I can't see that anyone on the sidewalk would have been in much danger.

              And, of course, it was me who chased the governor for the story, not the other way around.

              So lemme see what I can do, Sharon.

              I just thought it was cool that a governor could encounter a bear on the way to work!

              Wesley

              Wow people are mean! Who would have thought such nasty comments would be posted about the
              bear story. Wesley- any chance you could clarify that the governor didn't pitch the bear story and
              her kids weren 't in danger?
