        Dear Mr. Thorn:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        Hello Governor Sarah,



       I was quick to send an e-mail two weeks ago imploring you to cut the Capital Budget. And
       now I would like to be quick to offer a hearty Congratulations on a job well done.    I
       know it took much courage to make the decisions you've made and I'm sure you'll be hearing
       from your "constituents" and legislators regarding their various pet projects and
       programs.



                                                               1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0003991

        I Corinthians 16:13 tells us to stand firm, be courageous and strong and do everything in
        Love.  In the coming weeks and months, I'm sure there will be many tests and struggles and
        challenges to the hard decisions you've made. Stand firm!



        Again, congrats on a job well done.



        Sincerely,



        Craig Thorn
