          Governor-



           Just got a call from rep gara who wants to urge you not to commit to the 10 percent gross
          on legacy fields. Says its way too low. Wants you to work on that rate with leggies. He
          fears commiting to bthe rate now. Cause problems later. He wanted to tell you before the
          press conference.

          Mike- would you have Beth work with Seamount of the IOGCC speech. That's coming up
         quickly and I'm not sure what they're expecting from me. It's a 15-min speech titled "View
         from Alaska" is what I understand. The speech needs to be in the context of the meetings'
         agendas.
