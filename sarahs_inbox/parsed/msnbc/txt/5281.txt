                 I'm not sure what to do with this. He wrote again yesterday , complaining that he never received a
                 response. Is there any way to find his comments and let him know they were received and appreciated?

                 No one ever suggested that the Gov. would respond. The clearly stated original request for
                 ideas, also clearly stated that someone from the "Transition Team" for each group would
                 respond. I don't for a minute expect the Gov. herself to respond.

                 Thank you for writing to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. The concerns, opinions,
                 and/or information you
                 have sent are important and valuable to the Governor. Although she is unable
                 to
                 respond to each and
                 every email herself, your message has been received and is being reviewed by
                 the
                 appropriate staff person
                 in this office who can best address your need ,                suggestion, or comment.

                MESSAGE:
                When the Gov , was first elected , she solicited suggestions in various areas
                including Public safety.     A
                promise was made that all submissions would receive a response .    I have never
                had a response to my
                suggestions / comments .  I think the Gov. is doing a fine job and hope it all
                continues .    I still would
                like to know if what I wrote was of use , or was even read?
