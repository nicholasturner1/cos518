            I missed it, but sounds like this is another one that needs to be corrected asap so this
            reporter gets educated. Then the messaging from here on out has to be clear that we've
            been working on this since Steve was hired many weeks ago.

            What?? We're not calling the energy sp session b/c of.harris' letter!! Mike Ross has it
           wrong. We were talking about this weeks ago-back when we were discussing suspending the
           gad tax. Gov Palin had foresight on this one-i have the emails to prove it.
