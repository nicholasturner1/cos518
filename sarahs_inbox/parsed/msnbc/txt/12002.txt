           Governor, I'll pass that on to Diane, she'll be happy to hear that!  We can make apple
           slices with peanut butter & raisins on top, if that sounds good. I'll add it on our House
           calendar.  Thanks, Erika

          We've had an eventful week.




          On Monday we made three totems that tell the story of "The Box of Daylight".



          We kept two and gave Mr. F's class one.




          On Tuesday we played the Spin for Beans game . It's a game where children get practice
          grouping by tens.




          On Wednesday we celebrated 100 Days of School. We read 156 books, wrote 100 words and had
          a number hunt with numbers to 100. At the end of the day we



          blew out 100 candles on a delicious cake. Thank you Piper for bringing the cake!




          On Thursday we had our potlatch. We wore our paper blankets and headdresses.



          Edgar told the story of raven bringing the light and presented the totem to the Ravens.
          Then they gave us medallions that they had made. Then we feasted on smoked salmon and
          herring eggs.  Thank you Madison for bringing the herring eggs..




          On Friday each child made a bag to collect Valentines in.  You will find a list of friends
          and teachers on the reverse side of this note . Please include a Valentine for each child
          in our room.



                                                       2




                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0011753

           I will also attach a note asking for donations for our Valentine Party. We do



           have plenty of juice already so don't worry about that.




           We are planning to keep the same schedule for conferences that we had in the fall. Please
           let me know if you would rather meet at a different day or time.



           If you weren't here in the fall let me know the day and time works best for you.



           I will try to accommodate you.
