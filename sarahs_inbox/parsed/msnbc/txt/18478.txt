             Here's the schedule for three weeks of home games , then hopefully we'll have a playoff game in Jnu....

             Fri. 9/14 8pm vs. Colony
             Fri. 9/21 8pm. vs. West Valley
             Sat. 9/29 8pm. vs. Rainier (Oregon)

            We'll have the House ready with the wreaths, etc... whenever it works with your schedules!

            E- when's a home football game for JDHS? Maybe the travel date(s) would coincide with catching a game. The girls
            and I, anyway, could stay over long enough to catch one if Todd and Track have to get back after photos.

            Tib- anyone know when the king air has to return from servicing? I assume it has to fly thru Anchorage? If so,
            maybe that's a good way to get my family down here for First Family events incl the official family photos (which a
            year later we still haven't done), the mansion Christmas photo shoot (Erika's on it - she'll put wreaths on the door or
            fireplace and we'll call it good... Maybe outdoor shot with wreath on exterior), the Alaska Magazine photos with
            family in Juneau, etc. Otherwise, we need commercial reservations soon.

            The sooner the better on the christmas pics! My kids are getting busier than ever and it will be impossible to have
            everyone together if it's not in the next couple of weeks - just for the day is good enough. Do you want Kris to help
            me on this one?

            Todd- what date's good for you? I can take the kids out of school if need be. Either king air or commercial...
