                This is correct we are vetting these with the tools we have available publicly, but this appears to be a different
                Carle than the one reported below.

                John Carle that was appointed to the Northern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission was born on 7-17-1973.
                Richard Carle could be a relative to John Carle.

                Excerpt from the 10/30 Press Release:
                                              "Pacific Salmon Commission Northern Panel

                Governor Palin re-appointed Russell Thomas of Ketchikan and John Carle of Hydaburg to the
                Northern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission.

                The Northern Panel provides technical and regulatory advice to the Pacific Salmon Commission, a
                U.S.-Canada treaty organization that manages salmon originating In Southeast Alaska/Northern
                British Columbia rivers. The panel helps negotiate and implement treaty provisions, offers
                recommendations on fish management, and reviews technical data on each nation's annual fishing
                and salmon enhancement programs.

                Carle is a lifelong Alaskan and commercial fisherman who operates from Hydaburg, fishing for
                salmon, herring and shrimp. He was nominated as an alternate for a seat designated for a
                member of the public with experience in salmon fisheries. He was originally appointed as an
                alternate to the panel In 2005."

                I;ll ask Frank about this... don't know anything about the guy, but assume B and C vetted all names
                through court records.

                This came to me today. It may or may not be the person you
                recently appointed. The date of birth would probably give you an idea.
                I thought it better to pass it on than not. Talis

                 Talis Colberg,

                 Richard Carle DOB 8-9-64 is currently facing the following charges that
                 I am aware of:

                 Stalking in the 2nd Degree
                 Violating Conditions of Release
                 PTRP for an underlying Assault4DV

                 Richard Carle DOB 10-27-68 is currently facing these charges:

                 Driving With License Revoked ( 2 separate charges)
                 Felony DWI
                 Violating Conditions of Release

                 Also, James Scott is handling both of these cases. He might be able to
                 provide more information. He is in a jury trial today - so he will be
                 busy for most of the day today.

                 Also, again, I am not trying to poke my nose where it does not belong.
                 If this is something I should butt-out of, just let me know. I only
                 recognized the name, and thought it might be information that the people
                 who appointed Richard Carle might want to know.

                 If you need anything else, please let me know.

                 Nick

                 Talis Colberg,



                 Just wanted to drop a short line regarding a recent appointment made by
                 Gov. Palin. Richard Carle of Hydaburg (on located on Prince of Wales
                 Island, near Ketchikan) was appointed to the Northern Panel of the
                 Pacific Salmon Commission . I'm not sure who this individual is, but we
                 are currently prosecuting two different Richard Caries.



                 One is Richard S. Carle , date of birth 10-27-1968.



                 The other is Richard Carle, date of birth 8-9-1964. This individual is
                 from Prince of Wales Island, so this might be the same individual Gov.
                 Palin appointed.



                Just wanted to give you an FYI. It is none of my business how Gov.
                Palin makes appointments, or if this information is relevant, but I
                thought I would pass it along just in case it might be something that
                could save Gov. Palin a future situation. Feel free to disregard if
                this is not important.



                Hope you are doing well.



                Nick
