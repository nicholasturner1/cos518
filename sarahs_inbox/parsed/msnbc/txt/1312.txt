  UGH. I had a little accident with my blackberry a few minutes ago... it involved an accidental submerging
  in water. I now have to rely on computer and my other cell, K 4a, L, for communication.. just wanted
  you to know if I don't respond immediately. This sucks.

  Frank, do you have Wyatt's contact info? Needless to say, I've lost my contacts.
