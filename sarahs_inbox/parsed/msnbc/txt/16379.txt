                  Subject: Governor PaliNFox News/Laura Ingram
                  I just heard from Virginia Grace, the producer of the Laura Ingram show on
                  Fox News TV. Ms. Ingram would like to do an interview with the Governor
                  between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. today, East Coast time. The subject would be
                  the Governor's recent letter to Majority Leader Reid on ANWR.

                  I gave the producer the coordinates for Sharon and Rosanne, and she will call
                  at 8:00 a.m., Alaska time. If you want to reach Ms. Grace in the meantime,
                  her number is 212-301-5786.
