           Rhonda Boyles called today to ask if I had any recommendations for the above mentioned board . They're looking
           for someone from the Valley to decide which charitable organizations in the Valley should receive appropriations.
           She came up with Judith Carmony and Candy Easley . I haven't returned her call . Thought I would run it by you
           first.
