                Cockerham should be ashamed. I do not know how he learned about it.

                His first foul was was an implication that we are cherry-picking out of state . "The contract for "AGIA
                communications consultant services " is not being publicly bid." The DNR procurement officer (not
                me) researched in-state firms and sent notifications to the top three , as well as one out-of-state firm.

                His second foul is to try to spin negatively our need for yet another consultant to add to the slew of them
                we already have. Here is the last email I sent him, on 4/3, after he indicated to me that he thought it
                sounded like we were hiring a "PR firm":

                "Sean,
                A "PR firm" is hired to actually spread information, widely, to the public to gain public awareness, to
                promote a story. By contrast, a "communications consultant" would provide us expertise and guidance on
                who and how to alert media outlets about a story (should there be one), to give media the opportunity to
                pick up the story if it is compelling, whereupon the story is carried under its own momentum; the latter
                does not contemplate the need for anybody to "push" the story, but rather to alert media to the existence
                of the story, allowing them to decide whether to pursue it. This distinction is very important, since we are
                not interested in paying anybody to advertize or promote our Findings decisions to the public."

                Third, he failed to pick up on a point I was clear and emppatic about, which is that we are only doing this
                because when Kurt and I travel around the country, it has been shocking to us how little people know
                about our project, and what it could do for America. Clearly, I told him, we need an expert to help us
                reach media who can help us help the nation. This would have been an obvious rejoinder to the Hawker
                garbage . But Sean elected not to carry that quote.

                Just got Kurt' s email. Yes, happy to join a call to Sean.

                Bruce

               I will let you know what I find out. Bruce - Kurt. Didn't this come up months ago?

                Sharon- gasline team is very disappointed that someone contacted ADN to spin the "PR " firm story into something negative.
                I need you to discreetly find out who talked to Sean C about this and released it as a negative story . I have a feeling who may
                have done it, to make the gasline team look bad , but I need proof of it so I can deal with it.

                How did Sean C. think to do a story today in ADN on your solicitation of outside PR firm? And are all local firms excluded?

                Wondering how it became a story today , who called him.
