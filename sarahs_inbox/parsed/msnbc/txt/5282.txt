                 Hi Michelle,

                 All "Voices" had an individual personal response sent back by a member of the Transition Team. Mr Wasserman
                 received a generalized response on December 9t'. The files were sent to the Commissioners of each
                 department. The names/email addresses were withheld per Mike Tibbles, so the Commissioners would not have
                 been able to respond.

                 His comment is attached, it may be good to forward over to the Commissioner Monegan's office for comment?

                 Hope this helps. If not let me know what I can do.

                 I'm not sure what to do with this. He wrote again yesterday, complaining that he never received a response. Is
                 there any way to find his comments and let him know they were received and appreciated?
                 -Michelle

                 No one ever suggested that the Gov. would respond. The clearly stated original request for ideas, also
                 clearly stated that someone from the "Transition Team" for each group would respond. I don't for a
                 minute expect the Gov. herself to respond.

                 Thank you for writing to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. The concerns, opinions,
                 and/or information you
                 have sent are important and valuable to the Governor. Although she is unable to
                 respond to each and
                 every email herself, your message has been received and is being reviewed by the
                 appropriate staff person
                 in this office who can best address your need, suggestion, or comment.

                 Web mail from: Mr. harry wasserman
                 address: 8124 poplar juneau AK 99801

                 MESSAGE:
                 When the Gov. was first elected, she solicited suggestions in various areas
                 including Public safety.    A
                 promise was made that all submissions would receive a response.     I have never
                 had a response to my
                 suggestions/comments.    I think the Gov. is doing a fine job and hope it all
                 continues.   I still would
                 like to know if what I wrote was of use, or was even read?
