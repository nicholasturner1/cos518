   Subject : Look 2 a Book Tea- Wednesday, May 21st 4:00 to 5:00pm. at the Governor's House
  Todd,

  I talked to Lynne Smith about hosting this event, she'll be out of town 5/13 and might
  have something with Labor on 5/21; if possible she will attend. Commissioner
  Thompson has agreed to host this years Look 2 a Book Tea and present the award to this year's
  recipient. The tea is scheduled on Wednesday, May 21st from 4:00 to 5:00pm. at the House.

  Jerry Reinwand said he'd find a $500. grant, but is avoiding certain groups/lobbyists. Jennifer Scott, said
  that they have a $500. reserve just in case we don't secure the funding, so it's taken care of either way.

  IF you change your mind- we'll see you on the 21st, if not- we've got it covered.

  Thanks,
  Erika
