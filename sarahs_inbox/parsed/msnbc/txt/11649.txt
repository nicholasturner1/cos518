             If his quotes are innaccurate , he's a liar then and needs to be called on it.

            I wasn't debriefed after that mtg - were there problems there? Is Halcro's account
            accurate?

            There were 11 people in the meeting. For the State, they were Marty, Tom, Pat, and Larry.



            Then, there were Senator Stevens and three of his staff: George Lowe (Chief of Staff),
            Kate Williams (Legislative Director), and Kevin Simpson (Energy). Also present were
            Senator Murkowski and two of her staff: Isaac Edwards (Legislative Director) and Chuck
            Kleeschulte (Energy).



                                                                     1

             I can't figure out how Halcro got the information and don't know of any way to check at
             this end.  Senator Stevens has always insisted on the confidentiality of such meetings and
             that has been respected by all concerned.



             We've spent part of this morning correcting some inaccurate information that came out of
             the meeting from the Senate side.

           My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
           obviously provided it.  I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
           relationship we hope to have with the delegation.

             In our debrief with the gas team afterwards , we discussed each DC meeting and what, if
             anything , we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
             meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts , and I have requested
             this but have not heard back.



              Senator Stevens is adamant ( and probably so is Senator Murkowski ).  In our collective
              opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform , not cut off communications.



             Fortunately , we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation . If there
             is activity , it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE . The reality is that AGIA is the only
             game in town , and I believe that the delegation understands that.



             Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
             hopefully that dialogue will help.   The next big DC event is FERC's next report to
             Congress on the gasline . Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
             FERC understand the current situation.



             Because of the importance of your question ,    I'm taking the liberty of adding the Governor
             to our email exchange.



             P.S.

             On a more optimistic note , all of the other meetings went very well .          The participants
             were interested and receptive.

             Jan 30: Mr. AGIA goes to Washington



     i       Last week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update back
             to Alaska ' s Congressional delegation.

            With a year behind us and little progress , DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR Deputy
            Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska Senators.

             In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski ,           Irwin and
                                                          3




                                                                                                      PRA GSP01 _0011003

            Rutherford encountered senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both Stevens and
            Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.

             Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't listen
             last time."

            And, at one point, Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
            AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."

            As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
            pipeline.
