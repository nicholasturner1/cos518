          Yes, I told Dan Fauske that I'd oblige(sp?) the guy (he's Fauske's buddy and had dared him
          to ask me), and keep his streak streakin' ! He's done 7 gov's, I guess, and Fauske said
          he didn't want the streak to be broken. So...

          Whatever it takes to keep an of Alaskan tradition alive.

          Governor-



           Did you commit to a haircut at the captain cook barber shop? Apparently the old crusty
          barber there has cut all of the govs hair except for you and cowper.
