             MESSAGE:

             Governor




             I'm writing to you today in regards to our issues with hunting within Alaska .   There seems
             to be more and more hunters chasing an ever decreasing population of game . After reading
             and commenting on the Jan 08 Fish & Game list of proposals to changes of 2008 hunting
             regulations , it has become apparent that Alaska is not managing its game with the average
             Alaskan resident in mind .   I would like to know how Non Residents are allowed to make
             proposals to change Alaskan hunting regulations . Why do we allow a non resident guide who
             is only coming to Alaska to make money to propose and lobby for changes ? Do you think he
             is proposing changes that will benefit Alaskans ? Of course not, his proposals will benefit
             him and other guides alike .  There is something wrong when non resident sheep hunters
             harvest just as many sheep as residents. There ' s something wrong with the fact that in
             theory . 100% of permits can be drawn by non residents . I would hope you agree that the
             majority of our permi

             is should be going to residents. How shameful would it be if all 150 permits issued for
             the Delta Control Use Area went to non resident ? Some of the new permit areas have been
             given a cap on how many permits can go to non residents '. The rest of our permit areas
             should be the same way . Why do we give our recourses away? A non resident goat tag goes
             for $350.00 but yet that same permit in another state is well over a $1000.00




                                                                                                            PRA GSPO1_0008942
