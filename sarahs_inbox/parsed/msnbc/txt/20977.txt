       Governor -




       I'm "gate-crashing" as suggested to let you know that Friday, Oct. 12th is my DHSS
       leadership team retreat - the first under our realigned organizational structure (which
       you can find at: <http://www.hss.state.ak.us/commissioner/pdf/DHSSrealignchart.pdf>).




       A 5 minute drop-in by you on Friday the 12th




                                                           1
