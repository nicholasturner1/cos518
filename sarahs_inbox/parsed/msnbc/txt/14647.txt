             MESSAGE:

             Thank you for your stand for life. AS a resident of CA we have been fighting this battle
             for a long time and at times it seems we are losing on the legislative front. However we
             again have a petition that has qualified for the ballot and we will fight for the rights
             of life for all persons.

             Thank you again for a public example of principle above convenience.
