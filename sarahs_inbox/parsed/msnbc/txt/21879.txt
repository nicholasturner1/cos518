              Yikes!

              Dear Governor Palin,

                   I did not mean to get out ahead of you on this. I am glad that you are in agreement
              with what I said. I should have asked you first.



                   I spoke with Mr. Katz and we are working on a process to make it happen. Apparently
              at this point Don Young was the one who asked to join. Stevens and Murkowski will be
              approached by Katz.



                    Talis

              Dear Mr. Katz,

                     Thank-you for the message .   Sorry I missed you. I tried to call. I will try again
              tomorrow.

                      We think it would be helpful and positive to have the support of the delegation.
              Go ahead and let them know we would appreciate their support.    Thanks Talis

               A staffer in behalf of at least one member of the Alaska Congressional Delegation, and
               perhaps all three, asked whether it would be possible for the delegation to join in the
               state's amicus brief in the Exxon Valdez litigation . We were non committal but promised
               to ask.




               Any guidance you can give us would be appreciated .            Thanks.
