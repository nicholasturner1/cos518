          Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to

          the citizens and get bills introduced in the state legislature in california florida and
          elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they should split the revenue stream
          with a specified amount ( maybe half ) going to the citizens as a direct benefit

            How much does each alaskan get?

           What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the
          citizens?

            Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?



           Would you be interested in writing or talking about this?

            Thanks

           Newt

              This was sent out to all papers tonight. There's an additional table which lays out all
              of the changes to the contract. Randy Ruaro has it, I believe. We will be posting this
              on the DOA main webpage tomorrow, so it'l be easily accessible - you won't have to
              find this email.
