                Governor.

                On July 3rd, 2008, the OMB analyst sent me an e-mail stating that there were 395 trooper positions
                authorized in the budget (284 troopers, 10 corporals, 65 sergeants, 23 lieutenants, 10 captains and 3
                majors).

                As of June 30, 2008, the payroll system showed 56 of these positions as vacant (49 trooper positions, 2
                corporal positions, I sergeant, 3 lieutenants, and I captain)

                The OMB analyst noted the numbers would change if there were new hires or retirements that had
                not had their paperwork processed yet through Personnel.

                Randy
