            Good morning,



            I am looking forward to being back in the office tomorrow and batting around these

            concepts in person.      For the time, though, thought it is helpful to lay out some

            ideas to ponder until then....

            Privileged or 9   Give it some thought and maybe we could discuss it more tomorrow.




            I'll be available for a couple hours more and then out of pocket while I fly home.

            Hope all is well with you both.
