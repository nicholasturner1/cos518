               Governor,

               We currently have $33. 0 Million of funding available that we are using right now to install
               signals, purchase ROW, surveying and design for upgrading the Palmer/Wasilla Hwy. We are
               phasing our work on the PW Highway and using GF appropriations to save ourselves from a
               significant EIS and onerous federal oversight if we were to use Federal Highway funds. The
               next work items include:

                1) PW Highway/Trunk Road Intersection $10.0 Million - this will allow us to expand to 4
               lanes the PW Highway approximately'/2 mile in each direction from this intersection including
               turn lanes. The Trunk Road, Phase 1 project does not include this intersection work.

               2) Evergreen-Dogwood Couplet                  $18.7 Million - this will make the East end of the
               PW Highway a couplet to improve flow and address the numerous accidents that occur on this
               stretch of road. This project is already under design and will be ready for construction in FY10.

               A very critical need is an additional $5.0 Million to fully fund Phase 1 of Trunk Road
               improvements. You authorized $15.0 Million of GF in the FY09 capital budget, but we still
               need the $5.0 to fully fund the project. We will be ready to advertise this project in July 2008. I
               highly recommend that we include Trunk Road as a budget amendment so we can advertise this
               needed project once the budget is signed.

               In summary, we will submit budget amendments for the following projects (In priority basis):

               Trunk Road -Phase 1                            $5.0 million
               PW Highway Intersection at Trunk Road           $10.0 Million
               PW Highway - Couplet Construction                $18.7 million

               Governor:

               Commissioner Von Scheben called and asked me to let you know he is working on
               getting you the information about funding and roads in the Mat - Su.  I believe he
               will be sending it to Karen Rehfeld and the Chief-of - Staff as well.
