            Shoot- I clicked on Kristan Cole's addy instead of Kris Perry's addy when sending this
            email. Yikes, it's another lesson to be so flippin careful on email distribution!

            I think Janice can refine our distribution list to make sure it only includes
            commissioners and Governor's staff--any support staff for commissioners or Governor's
            staff should be removed. It narrows the scope of who could be leaking emails, and easiers
            for us to determine who's accountable.



            Also, we could bring up in cabinet meeting that only commissioners should have access to
            their personal state email accounts--their secretaries should only have access to the
            general commissioner/department account.  Just some ideas...

            may be asking you to Track it down today- this was an internal email from steve to all
            commissioners. It ended up in reporters' hands. Not good, again.

             We've had a few emails end up in reporters and leggies' hands this past week. Anyone know
             how the press got ahold of Steve's email from Friday, asking for input on energy plan?
