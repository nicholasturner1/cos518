             Governor - I know that you want to keep Friday flexible. We do have a

             request in though from Marty Rutherford.



             BG's Martin Houston would be willing to come to Juneau to meet with you

             either Friday, 10.26 or Saturday, 10.27. I think we may want to offer

             up Friday before noon.



             Your schedule so far looks like this:

             Friday, 10.26.07 - 2:15 - 3:00 p.m. - Alaskan/Russian Tea Party w/3rd

             grade classes at Riverbend.       Piper invited also. I will give her the

             bookmarks to hand out to the classes.

             5:00 p.m. - Haunted House @ Nugget Mall put on by Boy Scouts and JNU

             Firefighters. (If Piper would like to attend).



             Saturday, 10.27.07 - 12:30 p.m. - Costume Contest @ Nugget Mall -

             1:00 p.m. - Parade of Costume's

             7:00 p.m. - JNU Chamber speech/dinner. Piper will be handing out awards
                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0007002

              Pls keep Friday real flexible. I'm going to do a few things with piper

              that day... I think we'll do that costume thing at the mall that

              afternoon and I'll have her visit her teacher too.        Also, is Juneau

              chamber on sat?     I think we'll go to Juneau Christian Cntr on sunday.
