            The Governor has been invited by Mayor Itta to see the Whaling event firsthand between April 23 and May 6.
            Would that be a better time to go?

            Governor,

            Before I begin looking at your schedule , do you want to try and get to Barrow in the next two
            weeks - before whaling season begins ? Or shall I just try to send Tom Irwin?

            Please provide guidance.

           Thanks,
           Meghan
