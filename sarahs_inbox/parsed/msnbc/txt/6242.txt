        Got asked again today by McAllister because I used the term "probable sp session this
        fall" when discussing Vic Kohring's replacement. Bill zipped right past the big
        announcement of Wes Keller and focused in on sp session again. Y'know, I think the
        tremdendous interest in this, esp by reporters, has to do with logistics - they want to
        know where they should plan on camping this fall - Juneau or road system? October or
        later?




        Bradner got his other front-page story wrong, too, on our operating budget. I think he
        woke up on the wrong side of the bed the day he filed those stories.

        Governor,



        I apologize for the confusion. The articles were written by Tim Bradner who took my
        statement that we had not found a fundamental flaw with PPT (something different than what
        was expected), and spun it as a tacit endorsement. Tim has a viewpoint that comes through
        in his reporting.  Throughout our interview, I never implied that PPT was good; in fact, I
        told him that I thought we could do better to target the credits toward the riskier
        exploration side, not give them across the board as PPT does. Tim chose to downplay those
        statements.



       Until we complete our review, make a recommendation to you, and you announce your
       intentions regarding a special session, I 'm trying to keep the press message as a fair
       assessment of the options.




       I'm also looking forward to our next meeting on PPT. I expect it will be early next week.
                                                                 1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0003215

         I still believe we will come up with a better option on the gross, but the politics are
         explosive, so we need to have all our ducks in a row before we launch anything. Tibbles
         and Joe will have thoughts on that issue.



         Again, I'm sorry the article created confusion. I agree with you that the sooner we come
         together on our plan, and get a positive message out , the better.



         -Pat

        Pat- we'll hopefully be meeting on ppt soon. The articles in yesterday's ADN and J of C
        sounded like a one - eighty departure from the consistent message re : ppt NOT being " sound".
        I was asked to respond yesterday by a few reporters in Juneau, and also by legislators who
        may now think we're confused... as they still expect the sp session call this fall and
        were surprised to read your comments . My response was that I haven't changed my mind about
        the need to revisit ppt this fall.
