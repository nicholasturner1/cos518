            MESSAGE:

            I'm From Noerthern New York and a conservative Republican and I think that I have finally
            found a Republican Politician that the party can be proud of. Everything that I have read
            about you, speak of a really all round great person. I think that you would make a great
            Vice. President. I hope that the Republician Party realizes this, You would have my vote. I
            felt that you should hear this from an ordinary person. Keep up the great work and good
            luck! Bob Banker
