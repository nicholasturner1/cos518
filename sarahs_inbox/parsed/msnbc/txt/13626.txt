           Don't think we ever did the homer lunch thing. I sent to Kari Spencer way in early 07. I
           could find the guy's name for the next time you make it to homer. He owns the grog shop
           winery.  Tall feller.

            I wonder if I ever had that lunch with the Homer bidder. Yikes- does anyone remember?

           Frank- did you see wesley's blog on biz lic? Shoot. Don't know who's idea it was, but it
           was all about transparency! Letting alaskans know who was sitting on important bills(s).
           Stedman's comment was the email shouldn't have been sent, instead the chairman should have
           been requested to move it! What a joke. How many times was he asked to move it? Well maybe
           the blog/story will give the issue publicity and the follow up can open a door to also
           speak about tire tax and other good bills they're still trying to kill because they're
           either greedy spenders and/or they hate to see our name on anything that could pass. I
           wish Mike wouldn't have given a "no comment" comment in reply to wesley's questions on
           this.

            Reminds me of the Homer Library luncheon where Lt Gov Leman's lunch barely fetched $200,
            and Candidate Palin's lunch fetched $650 for the Library Foundation.



            John and Nicole? Harris is married??

           Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items
           was a package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch
           w/Binkley and his wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one
           bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500. :)
