          They haven't been told by me - let me ask Tibs what he's relayed to leggies thus far.

          Governor -




         Have lawmakers been notified of your upcoming PPT announcement? I don't want them to find
         out through the media advisory - I HAVEN'T SENT IT YET! Please advise.

          Subject : interview and special session




          Ralph Thomas with the Seattle Times would like a 5 minute phone interview with you today
          or tomorrow regarding investigations.  He read the Steve Quinn article and would like to
          ask questions along those lines.



          This reporter met you during the campaign. ( 360) 236-8266



          Also- is there anything I can give to Channel 2 regarding the special session in advance
          of the announcement ? Maybe something like - the special session will likely be in
          October ...... or likely be on the road system . A little hint goes a long way.




          Thanks
