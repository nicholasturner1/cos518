                Pis let me know when the new policy on email searches is drafted. Hopefully we can take care of that this week? I
                still haven't received answers from Mike on the emailed questions I asked him on Saturday re : the open-ended
                aspect of his request to you in the email search.

                Just want to make sure it's in writing asap that this isn 't allowed.
