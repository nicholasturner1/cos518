         In response to your interest in having additional information, I have reviewed several
         documents and have attached just two. The first is a good summary which appeared as an
         article in the Wall Street Journal on August 22nd.



        The second is a brief excerpt from a Congressional Research Report updating an earlier CRS
        study. As you will note, the excerpt deals with the National Security considerations
        associated with the Convention. Since National Security is the principal reason cited by
        most opponents, I thought that this brief point-counterpoint would be useful.



        I am not an expert in international law, but the arguments made by the Legal Advisor to
        the State Department and by the US Navy were convincing to me. Despite this, I know that
        the opponents, including various bloggers, will not give up on their opposition to the
        Convention.

          There have been no Senate votes in recent history. So, it's hard to tell exactly who
          supports the Convention and who does not.



          Previously, Senators Lott (MS) and Inhofe (OK) have confirmed their opposition. On the
          other hand, Senators Biden and Lugar, Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the
          Senate Foreign Relations Committee, support the Convention, but it is not yet clear
          whether they will bring it up this year.



          According to Senator Murkowski's staff, the Senator is getting Alaska constituent mail on
          both sides of ratification. A majority supports approval.



          I think we can expect some opposition in Alaska if you support the Convention. There are
          some Alaskans who believe that the US has failed to assert its sovereign rights to Wrangel
          Island and certain other islands owned by Rus sia. These individuals can be expected to
          oppose ratification of the Convention for fear of losing US sovereignty.



          I know from precious experience that these folks can be quite vigorous in their
          opposition.  However, most experts believe that, in the absence of US approval of the
          Convention, we would have to assert our rights unilaterally. For these reasons, they
                                                         2




                                                                                                    PRA GSP01_0004295

          favor the Convention, because it creates a forum for adjudicating claims in a quasi
          judicial manner.

         After we finalize, Sharon can send this letter to the international reporter who asked
         about this issue on Sunday.

         Dear Senator -------




         It is my understanding that the US Senate may consider the United          = Nations Convention on
         the Law of the Sea in the fall.



         With this in mind , I am writing to express my strong support for = Senate ratification of
         the Convention .  In my opinion , the Convention = would be beneficial to the US and Alaska
         in various ways , but I want to = focus on one aspect in this correspondence.



         As you know , several Arctic nations have recently asserted claims to = submerged lands off
         their coasts.   The Convention on the Law of the = Sea establishes the framework for these
         assertions.   To date, 155 = nations, including Canada and Russia, have approved the
         Convention . = If the US does not ratify the Convention , the opportunity to pursue our =
         own claims to offshore areas in the Arctic Ocean might well be = lost.



         As a consequence , our rig htful claims to hydrocarbons , = minerals , and other natural
         resources could be ignored .  In this = regard , geologists have prognosticated that
         billions of barrels of crude = oil and vast quantities of natural gas - not to mention
         various hard = rock minerals - might be present in the Arctic. In the absence of =
         affirmative action by the Senate , these resources could become the = property of nations
         with less valid claims.



         It is my understanding that the Bush administration and many = Senators, both Republicans
         and Democrats , have expressed support for = Senate ratification of the Convention.
         However, as you know , = ratification has been thwarted by a small group of Senators who
         are = concerned about the perceived loss of US sovereignty.



         I believe th at quite the contrary is the case . If the US does = not ratify the
         Convention, we will be denied access to the forum establishe = d by the international
         commun ity to adjudicate claims to submerged lands = in the Arctic.



         I also urge that the Congress authorize the programs and funds = necessary for the US to
         assert its sovereign rights . The assertion = of such rights requires significant research
         and information gathering .&nbs= p; Other Arctic nations have recently begun this process,
         and I understand = that the US is moving in this direction as well.



         I believe that you have previously supported Senate ratification of = the Convention.
         With this letter , I want to put my Administration on = record in support of the Convention
         as the predicate for asserting = sovereign rights that will be of benefit to Alaska and
         the nation . = Hopefully , this letter will assist you in articulating Alaska's = position
         to your c olleagues in the Senate.



         Thank you for considering my views.
