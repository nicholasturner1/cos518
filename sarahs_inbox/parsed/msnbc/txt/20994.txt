            "Achievement Trap: How America is Failing Millions of High-Achieving Students from
            Lower- Income Families"
            http://www.jackkentcookefoundation.orgjkcf web/Documents/Achievement%
            20Trap.Ddf). is a report by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation & Civic Enterprises with
            original research by Westat . It chronicles the experiences of high-achieving lower-
            income students during elementary school , high school , college , and graduate school.
            While some results are hopeful , other findings suggest that there are far fewer lower-
            income students achieving at the highest levels than there should be, they
            disproportionately fall out of the high-achieving group during elementary and high
            school , they rarely rise into the ranks of high achievers during those periods , and far too
            few ever graduate from college or go on to graduate school.
