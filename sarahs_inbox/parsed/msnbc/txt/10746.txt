                  Subject: Cook Inlet LNG Press Conference update

                Governor, All,
                I just finished speaking with Scott Jepson, CP, who provided the names of the Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips
                representatives that will be attending your Cook Inlet LNG-Agreement' press conference at noon on Thursday,
                January 3'd. They are:

                Marathon Oil
                Mr, Steve Hinchman, Senior Vice-President Worldwide Production (Houston)
                Mr. Pat Kuntz, Vice-President Natural Gas & Crude Oil Sales (Houston)
                Mr. David (Dave) Risser, Natural Gas Marketing Manager (Houston)
                Mr. Doug Thierwechter, Governmental Affairs Manager (Houston)
                Ms. Lee Warren, External Communications Manager (Houston)
                Mr. Mitch Little, Production Manager/Alaska Asset Team (Anchorage) *

                ConocoPhillips
                Mr. Jim Bowles. President, ConocoPhillips, Alaska (Anchorage)
                Mr. Jim Taylor, Vice President of Commercial Assets (Prudhoe, TAPS & Cook Inlet) (Anchorage)
                Mr. Scott Jepson, Manager, Cook Inlet Business Unit (Anchorage) *
                Mr. Roger Belman , Legal Counsel (Anchorage) *
                Mr. Michael Hurley, Governmental Affairs Manager (Anchorage)
                Ms. Natalie Knox, Community Affairs (Anchorage)

                * = Part of Negotiating Team for the Cook Inlet LNG Agreement

                We are working on talking points, questions & answers, and a one-page overview of the Agreement. We hope to
                have these materials to you, Mike, Joe and Beth, by Monday. I have also invited the state negotiating team to
                attend the press conference and that includes the following individuals: Nan Thompson (Unit Mgr, Division of Oil
                & Gas), Kevin Banks (Director, Division of Oil & Gas), Craig Tillery (Deputy Attorney General, Civil Division, Dept
                of Law), and myself.

                Finally, I believe that Eugene (Gene) Dubay, Senior Vice President of Operations/Semco Energy (parent
                company of Enstar) is also planning to attend the press conference and would be willing to say some words of
                support. I will speak with him before Monday regarding what he might like to add.

                Beth, Is there anything further we need to do to help you and the Governor prepare for the Press Conference?

                Thanks, everyone, for your support,
                Marty
