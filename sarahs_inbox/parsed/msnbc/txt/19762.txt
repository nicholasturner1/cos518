           Thanks. Would you do thank yous to boehner and the folks we had dinner with. They're
           passionate about anwr, understanding the energy issue is where they need to hang their hat
           be (in their words): "we got nuthin' else". They understand pelosi's npr-a proposal does
           nothing new.

            In general, all three members of the Congression= =3D al delegation support roads that
            facilitate natural resource developmen= t =3D or promote commerce between villages.



            I presume that " E-W" means a road that would = =3D approximate an East-West corridor and
            might intersect with a =3D = North-South artery. If so, the closest specific
            approximation that I = =3D can think of is Senator Stevens' previous support for a road
            corridor = in =3D the Gates of the Arctic Boot, that is, a road that would traverse = the
            =3D southern portion of the Brooks Range. If you can confirm = that I'm on =3D the right
            track with the reference to E-W, I'll make a = specific inquiry to =3D the Senator and his
            staff.



            There may be one complication. If federal = =3D lands are involved, the applicant would

            corridors.  = These =3D provisions are extremely cumbersome and bureaucratic and have =
            never been =3D used previously for this purpose.



            P.S.

            I hope that your visit with Congressman = =3D Boehner's entourage was a good one. Any
