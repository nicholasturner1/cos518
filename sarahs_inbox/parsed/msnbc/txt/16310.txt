             MESSAGE:

             First I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and your family on the
             wonderful new blessing from God you received recently. I was a first time mother at 34
             almost 2 years ago now and I know that the miracle of a birth is beyond words. I have no
             doupt that Trig will be fine and well loved, a good friend of ours had a little girl a
             month before Zoe was born and Addison also has downs syndrome. She's awesome and loves
             life even through a medical issue here and there. Now she is going to be a big sister
             soon, and she's soo excited. So, before I'm selfish and ask for something for my child, I
             first wanted to wish you well for your newest child!




             Now, the reason for my email is that a year ago, I sent out a request to all the 50 state
             Governors for my daughter Zoe's 1st birthday, we were trying to collect information and a
             signature or letter from each Governor, the response was AWESOME, and 29 state Governors
             replied.  Now Zoe will be two July 4th and I thought I would try to get the other 21
             states to send a greeting to put in her scrapbook, a part of history of each state. I
             understand you are busy and want to take care of the residents of your state first, but if
             you have time, please help us obtain information and a letter about your great state for
             Zoe.  Thank you for your time!




                                                                  1
