        Serving wine at Foundation Fundraiser and Juneau World Affairs Reception

        yes/no?



          I wanted to double check about serving wine at either of these events. I

        assumed we would not serve wine, but wasn't sure if we'd begin the new

        policy this week- or wait until next week when it's put forth through the

        media.



          They've taken most of the inventory out of the House , but they have the

        beverage fridge and the basement closet to finish up tomorrow.



         Thank you,

         Erika
