MESSAGE:

Congratulations and welcome to your new son! He is indeed a beautiful boy and a blessed gift from
God! As you may know, my daughter Jourdan, who is now 18, has Down Syndrome and is my
greatest joy, and she is truly an amazing young woman! You and your family have an amazing
journey ahead of you with Trig! I pray that he is healthy, I know he will be happy as he has come into
a wonderful family. I just want to let you know that if I can offer any support as a parent, or a friend
please don't hesitate to contact me. I know you have the support of your immediate family and
friends, but if Jourdan and I can be of any help to you and your family, let me know. Again,
congratulations and God Bless you all!
