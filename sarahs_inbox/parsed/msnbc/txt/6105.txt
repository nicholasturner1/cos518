            Governor,

            Joan and I looked through the backup regarding the projects listed in Mayor Begich's comments. After reading
            his comments, the inconsistency that comes to mind is Begich's ability to accurately read a spreadsheet.

            He claims that Chugiak Benefit Society was funded even though it was nothing they asked for. In fact, we vetoed
            the benefits society money.

            He claims that Chugiak Volunteer fire rescue was funded but Station 11 in Eagle River was not (and Eagle River
            serves more people ). Chugiak requested $75,000 to replace equipment including changing their 3 inch hoses to
            5 inch. This is a life safety issue. Eagle River requested money to improve their fitness and dorm rooms (not life
            safety and not as high of a priority).

            He claims we funded the Chugiak historical society but not the Port of Anchorage. Again, he has his facts wrong.
            The historical society was appropriated $5,000 for restoration of material (not even close to the $10 million
            requested by the Port in which other avenues of financing could have been obtained ). We vetoed all the money
            because it was not a priority of the state.

            He compares Chugiak High's turf to Dimond's. They are different. Dimond was not a priority of the school
            district We have a process by which communities can request funds for major projects (maintenance and
            construction). That is to put the project to the voters and seek school debt reimbursement from the State (usually
            70% State and 30% local ). Juneau voters just approved a project through this process . Chugiak's request was
            very similar, it was forwarded through the Municipality (why would the Mayor complain ), received local support not
            only through a local vote but through a local mill levy to help support the project.
            Mike
