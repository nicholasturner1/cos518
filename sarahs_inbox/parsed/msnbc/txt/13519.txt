              Is the criticism coming via radio? I ask only because I haven't seen any on the ADN,
              though I could have missed it. Are you getting e-mails critical of the administration?
              From last night's KTUU, ADN and JNU Empire stories I thought it was reported pretty
              well...putting it back in Lyda's lap where it belonged. I realize you might be hearing
              different reactions up north, though. I'm just curious so I can be prepared for what's
              out there.

              Thank you Russ. The more info I get on this, the better. Lyda was supposed to call me
              today between 3-4 between flights, but I never did hear from her. If she does reach me, to
              chew me out, I'm going to tell her exactly what I think about all this... amazing that
              Tuckerman and her people succeeded to a degree here on putting the burden on us instead of
              her being held accountable. We are receiving great criticism by those who are
              misunderstanding the issue, and the process.

             We've heard very little, except from some democrat legislators who were

              opposed to the abortion bills being added to the call of the special

              session on AGIA.     Other random responses were that the letter was

              well-received among those who are sick of Lyda' s games .... the numbers

              are MANY.




              I will reach out to the legislators you've mentioned below and see if

              they have thoughts to share regarding this issue.

              I sent this to Sean :     and have u guys heard what lawmakers want us to do

              with abortion bills?



              Ltgov: I'm waiting to hear from friendly leggies on what they'd like to

              see us do with calling for session on abortion bills. If/when called, it

              will be in Anchorage. And very short in duration. Any advice on this to

              add to what Coghill, Dyson, Dallstrom, et al may share?
