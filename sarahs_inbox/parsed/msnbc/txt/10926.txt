            Ok.



            And tell Transcanada, by the way, it'd do them some good to get up here with a presence to
            introduce themselves to the good folks of Alaska. (I mean, "invite" them, please)

           Subject: Shell's drilling plans




           Governor:



           I just recieved a phone call from Cam Toohey regarding their drilling plans for 2008. I
           wish it were better news.



           Due to complications with their air permit as well as the uncertain outcome at the 9th
           Circuit on their drilling plan, Shell will only commit one drill ship to 2008. The second
           one will be used in the lower 48.



           The reason they are making this move is to ensure that if they run into permitting and/or
           legal challenges, they can still get support from their corporate leadership for 2009. If
           they don't make this move, they are fearful that they would have spent almost $600 million
           with nothing to show for it but seismic data. Dry holes would be one thing, but nothing
           is unacceptable.




                                                                  1




                                                                                                                PRA GSP01 0009544

            The consequence here is that the drilling that would most likely occur would be shallower
            and result in a longer period of time before they would know or be able to develop any
            discoveries.   That means a year further from the real economic benefits in the form of
            jobs , but also a year further from increased throughput in TAPS .  It is the increased TAPS
            throughput that affects the State's bottom line--to the tune of $65 million annually.



            Shell does intend to stick around. They are still going to commit one drill ship to the
            Beaufort , they will continue their seismic program ( and research ), and they are still very
            interested in the Chukchi lease sale next month .  Of course , they are still extremely
            interested in Point Thomson!




           Also, Cam mentioned that Marvin Yodum would still like to catch up with you over the phone
           regarding a variety of issues , including their vision of LNG's place in the development of
           Alaska gas.
