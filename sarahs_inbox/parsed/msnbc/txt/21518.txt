             Dear Sarah.

                             I thought you would want to know ,       since you've had a good working

             relationship for many years         ( and he adores you) with burt , that his

             wife passed away yesterday Oct 24.

                            He is taking her death very hard .        Celia is being cremated.        There

             will be a Memorial Service at St Davids , but date is not yet

             established.

                            Take care, keep up the good work - we all root for you !              Merlyn

             Matheson
