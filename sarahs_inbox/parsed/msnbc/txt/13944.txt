            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,



            Congratulations on your soon-to-be fifth child. I'm a mother of four in Anchorage and can
            appreciate how excited you must be.



            I'm also a professional blogger and I write a blog called Scribbit about motherhood in
            Alaska and would enjoy an opportunity to interview you about your experiences as a mother
            in Alaska and as governor. The blog has 2,000 daily readers from around the world and
            Alaska.  It also won the best blog award from the Anchorage Daily News and UAA in 2007.
            Given my readers' fascination with Alaska I'm sure they would enjoy hearing your
            experiences.



            If you can arrange an interview, please contact me at (907) 279-0032. 2 look forward to
            hearing from you.




            Sincerely,



            Michelle Mitchell


                                                                  1
