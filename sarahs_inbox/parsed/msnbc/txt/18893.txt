          Lots of emails this morn and I'm catching up, but I need to update you on the Board of Ed
          meeting yesterday.  What I witnessed was fairly surprising. I watched Pat get steamrolled
          and treated badly by chair Esther Cox. It was not pretty and very clear that she was not
          excited about the 1.5hrs of testimony given by lots of parents around the state on
           homeschooling.



           I asked Glen on my way out if he had heard from Mike,             and he had not yet.        Its been a busy
           week so I 'll put a friendly bug in his ear on it.



           I'll put something together for review with SOLUTIONS for the team to review. I had a
           small mob of parents gather around me, thanking the Governor for being interested in
           theirs concerns to have someone attend.
