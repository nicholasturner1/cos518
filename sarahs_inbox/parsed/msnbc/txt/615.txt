Ok. But next week will be a bear trying to get to Juneau (instead of today and tomorrow) with Todd on
the slope. I'm not sure who's scheduling next wk's Juneau appts, but the ideal is for Juneau mtgs to
take place when todd is home - so he can take the kids. Don't want to be picky about it, but the
schedule should ideally reflect my work in Anchorage when todd's on slope, Juneau when he's in
wasilla. Almost a week-on, week-off sched until next semester starts when the girls can be with me in
Juneau.



Confidential be people gossip too much about my sched already. Thanks!

I'll get the kids in school today, then, unless Tibbles is already in Anchorage for our ppt mtgs
tomorrow, I need to get to Juneau tonight and spend the day there tomorrow. (Otherwise I won't get
there again until next week.)
