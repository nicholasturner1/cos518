           To Gov Palin




           I believe you had all the right to terminate commisioner Monegan for any reason.



           If the reason was because he would not do anything about the Trooper who had threatned to
           kill your father is a good reason.



           This trooper was privy to your security to include your travel etc/



           He could have very well arranged to have you set up in a serious accident etc



           After reading your email to the Col of the troopers this trooper should have been released
           from all duties as a trooper.




                                                               I




                                                                                                            P RA_GS P01 _0021528

            He is a bully



            He very well could have set up your accidemt on the palmer anchorage highway



            Let these soreheads do all of the investigations they want to do.



            Your safety as the Governor is     important    This guy had all of your security information
            available to him. some of these     law inforcment people have been arouind along time and our
            system is no beter than it was     20 years ago it is time some of them are retired for good
