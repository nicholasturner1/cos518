           I confirmed that I would join you in our roles as Gov/LG in presenting. awards at 2:30
           p.m., Saturday, at the invitation of the Kenai Peninsula Borough at Industry Appreciation
           Days. (or at least I asked Kelly C. to confirm it for me)



           They knew I already had a campaign booth there but we were told by the organizers that
           handing out awards has tradtionally been done by gov/lg and that taking one hat off and
           putting another on, at least for me, is not an issue since we'd be introduced as gov/lg.



           Please let me know you got this. Thanks.



           Sean
