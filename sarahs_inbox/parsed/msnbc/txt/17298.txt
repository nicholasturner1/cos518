               voted Tuesday to support legislation proposed by Gov. Sarah Patin to induce
               qualified firms to build an Alaska gas line. The Alaska Gasline Inducement Act
               (ALGA) would authorize contribution of up to $500M by the state Alaska toward the
               cost of obtaining necessary permits and regulatory approvals, promulgation of
               regulations that provide predictability in royalty value and the exercise of the
               state's right to receive its royalty share in kind or in cash, production tax
               incentives, and appointment of state pipeline coordinator to facilitate prompt
               state permitting are likely to induce qualified firms to build an Alaska Gas
               Pipeline. In return, the firm selected would provide a clear and definite timetable
               for construction of a gas pipeline, multiple take points in Alaska to assure the
               availability of natural gas for meet Alaska's needs and for the state's future
               development, and "distance-sensitive" rates" for in state delivery of gas. in
               Alaska ;and establishment of a local project headquarters and hiring offices in
               Alaska to hire qualified Alaskans to construct the gas pipeline and related
               facilities. AIGA is now before the legislature for action.

               Unfortunately, I was still in the Atwood Building when it was discussed and I do not
               know who said what, but will forward the minutes when I find them.
