            MESSAGE:

            Warm Greetings Gov. Palin :-)




            I pray all is well with you and your family and congratulations on your new arrival. My
            wife and family are happy for you.



            I'm typing this note with an olive branch in my hand because I suspect you are hearing
            from some awfully vocal whiners having to do with funding proposals. My heart goes out to
            you. I know. I've been there many times.



            I am the superintendent of Kashunamiut School District in Chevak Alaska. Unlike many rural
            bush villages, we are a growing community with more children than we can squeeze into our
            present school building. We are hoping to add an additional wing to accommodate the
            overflow. The wing will need to be added sooner or later. As you well know sooner is less
            expensive than later.



            On behalf of the Chevak community, you have a standing invitation to visit us anytime. We
            would love to have you.



            Best wishes on the difficult decisions you need to make.
                                                               1
