            Mike- Wesley reported you had a "no comment" comment re: his question last night re:
            30,000 biz lic addresses used to notify on biz l.ic fee legislation. Did you talk to him
            yet this morning to follow up? (He reported that you told him you'd be happy to talk to
            him in the morning about it.). The accusation is there was a violation of state email
            policy with the activity. He'll need clarification asap before that issue gets even more
            spun up. Pls let me know what Wesley's response was/is after you talk to him.
