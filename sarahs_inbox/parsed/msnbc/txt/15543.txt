              Gov. Palin,

              I am writing to thank you for your approving the funding for technology at Tumagain Elementary. It is a
              difficult process for you I a sure . We (PTA and MIR Parents) are so excited about the future educational
              experiences that this makes possible for our children.

              Thank you very much!
