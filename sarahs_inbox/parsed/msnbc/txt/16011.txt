           Hello Governor Palin, I am starting a local and e-mail campaign to enlighten people about
           your extraordinary credentials. You are clearly the obvious choice for VP running mate.
           Our country no longer has the option to allow self-serving people another four years to
           waddle through the White House. I follow the economy and politics closely and have studied
           all viable choices and you could best serve our country's needs. I trust you are open to
           this possibility and thank you for bringing backbone to our degrading political system.
           Respectfully, Ron Kircher.
