           Pls make it a shorter speech since I'll be reading it verbatim and it'll look weird to
           read off a script for so long.

           Fyi -- see below . You could say a quick hi and welcome rather than a long statement.

            Hey Rosanne,




            Kelly is checking with the LG to see if he can make it.




                                                                 1

            Sharon says it's totally up to the Governor, but there is an strong expectation for her
           to make the pitch - if she doesn't it would be very disappointing to the group. If at all
           possible, it's recommended that she perform the welcome - we could shorten it to two
           minutes of remarks with a couple for Q&A. Best case scenario , the Governor does the
           welcome.  As I mentioned, the LG has a full day and has left the building for good (unless
           the Gov calls him in for sure).   Please advise on how to proceed.
