             MESSAGE:

             As an Alaskan, and a high school teacher concerned about educating the next generation of
             Alaskans, I feel that any budget surplus should not be given to the residents here.



             We have a chance to set a fund to send all Alaskan youth to UAA or UAF to earn their
             Bachelor Degree for free.



             Let's lead the country in clearly established prioritites. I feel so strongly about this,
             I'll leave my teaching job and help establish this fund.
