                  Baby Shower Honoring Trig Palin to Benefit Soldiers

  August 15 , 2008, Juneau , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today announced she will attend a
  baby shower in Trig Palin's honor next week and that all gifts will be donated to help
  military families.

  Proceeds from the event will benefit the Family Ties Foundation. The foundation is a non-
  profit organization created to provide immediate support for the military families of
  wounded service members deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation
  Enduring Freedom. The event is being hosted by local morning radio personalities Bob and
  Mark from 106.5 KWHL.

  "My family has been so blessed by the arrival of Trig. It is my honor to share that blessing
  with our men and women in uniform through this event," Governor Palin said. "I invite all
  Alaskans who'd like to support our wonderful military families to participate."

  The event will take place at Romano's restaurant, on Fireweed Lane at C Street, on Monday
  from 5 to 7 p.m. The public is invited. Romano's restaurant will donate a portion of the
  sales from the evening to the Family Ties Foundation.
