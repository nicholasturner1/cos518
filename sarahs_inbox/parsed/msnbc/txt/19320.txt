           Kris/ Frank: wanted you to see also re: Linda's mom.



           Janice- I'll be working on tomorrow's gasline announcement speech today-but other than
           that I doubt I'm going anywhere for the state so you can note on sched: "no duty" !



           Mike- a possibility on First Family travel... past Govs had their special accounts from
           donors that they could spend on whatever... we're not allowed this, but we do still have
           $ in the Inaugural account. May we use that or ask the legislature to adopt that option
           for the Gov's office to utilize? (Assuming it takes a law change?)
