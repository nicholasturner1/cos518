            I spoke to Mayor Whitaker last night about waiting a week or so to go out with his
            declaration.  He needs to check with the Clerk to see what his options are. He will
            contact me by Noon to discuss further.

            Thanks so much for being there. I, too, am hearing everyday from people all over Alaska
            who are in distress over energy prices. They know the state has the resources to provide
            some relief to the resource owners, and I'm being asked what we plan to do to help.



            We had a great discussion about this yesterday as the team shared your work product with
            me re : Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Privilege or Persona M aterial   a acte


            Whittaker's announcement on Fairbanks disaster declaration will put us in a perceived
            reactionary mode so we need to get the word, out as soon as possible to let Alaskans know
            the pro ress being made towards plugging in some of these relief efforts. It'll be huge

            Had a positive town hall meeting in Bethel.



            Heard a lot of statements about how the whole area is hurting . The high cost of energy is
            absorbing the limited funds from the subsistence life style in this economically depressed
            area.



            They actually have people leaving Bethel as they cannot afford to stay.



            One person had forty apartments that were all full,,with a waiting list, last year. Today,
            there is a 20% occupancy rate.
