             Today I met w/Kristan, Dick, Joe Austerman, and Tina Otto on progress to date and possible
             solutions for transition. Commissioner Schmidt also joined us and had some good ideas on
             how Corrections can be part of the transition/ solution for farmers. It was in that
             meeting that I learned of Lyda's request. As you know, Kristan had requested (through Div
             of Ag) a legislative audit. The request was sent to Samuel's office on August 31st. After
             Kristan's persistence, we were told on September 19th that LB&A would not do an audit due
             to pending litigation. We also tried through OMB. However, due to logistics and
             involvement, Karen recommended that we seek an outside firm. The CPA firm, Mikunda
             Cottrell, started the audit yesterday.



             FYI, I also learned in our meeting today that Lyda's office has called Tina Otto in Law
             inquiring on the appraisal and how the proceeds from the sale will be used.



            Word is getting out that Lyda has requested an "emergency           audit". I've started receiving
            phone calls this afternoon.  Considering her unwillingness          to work with us, I hope that
            her actions do not undo much of the work that has been done         thus far... trying to find the
            balance between selling the assets and positive transition          for the producers.

             There are meetings over the next couple of days regarding transition (w/Northern Lights
             Dairy and other producers). We are all regrouping on Friday to firm up the transition
             plan.  The meeting is at 2pm.



             In closing, never have I seen a more dedicated, selfless, hard working group than those
             serving on BAC.

            Lyda just told me she's called for an extensive audit of MatMaid be she said she's
            received a lot of information concerning improprieties and "problems at MatMaid",
            including "conflicts of interest with people serving". I told her "no kidding there's been
            problems, that's why we have a dedicated team of volunteers trying to get information on
            what went wrong and then how to right MatMaid". I also asked her if she's seeking to get
            information on problems we inherited, or did she feel we caused MatMaid's problems? She
            said,  "it's both".



            What's frustrating is Kristan and Kris and others have begged for assistance to get our
            own audit of MatMaid, they've basically had to do it themselves, and now it sounds like a
            legislator who doesn't necessarily want to see us succeed is moving forward on her own
            intense audit. We've had push back on our own request, which is understandably quite
            frustrating for BAC members who've cared sincerely about MatMaid and have wanted and
            needed information on MatMaid operations since Day One. I asked Lyda why don't we work on
            this together, if truly now she wants to help on MatMaid, but her goals are evidently not
            our goals - as we 're not blaming this admin nor this BAC for the problems at MatMaid.

             So, head's up.



             And I still want Kristan's request to be granted re: an audit if that's what Kristan
             needs.
