                  Subject: Bill Signing Idea

                Good morning Governor,

                We have been looking for a good location to sign, HB 319, Rep Ramras ' dental bill in the Mat-Su Valley; per your
                suggestion maybe a dental office.

                Yesterday, Fran Ulmer contacted Kris and offered UAA as a place to sign the bill. I thought it might be a great
                idea and am looking for your thoughts on this.

                We must take action on the bill before June 25th.

                Please let me know if you like this suggestion.

                Thanks, Kelly
