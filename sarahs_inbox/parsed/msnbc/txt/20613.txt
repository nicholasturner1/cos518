                 Subject: TALKING POINTS FOR CNBC

               Governor,

               Attached are talking points for your review . No changes since you last reviewed them in early August. Just
               wanted to make sure that you had these in hand for a quick reminder if you needed them for CNBC tomorrow.

               Thanks,
               Meg
