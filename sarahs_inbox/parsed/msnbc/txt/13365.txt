            This has nothing to do with Alaska History, I just couldn't find a topic that was correct.
            I'm a Chugach Native living in Minnesota. Are you familiar with the writing entitled
            Welcome to Holland. It very wonderfully describes the birth/gift of a child with downs
            syndrome. It's very precious. Congratulations on the birth of your son. May you be blessed
            for many years to come.
