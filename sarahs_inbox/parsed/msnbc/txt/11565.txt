                 Janice,

                I've attached for the Governor and Mike's quick review an updated directory for RGA as per their request.
                I highlighted the changes I made. Removed Meg's name . Added the Deputies since we don 't yet have a
                director. Put your name in place of Kari's, etc.

                Please let me know if it is acceptable and whether any additional changes and/or deletions are needed
                and I'll get this sent back to them today.

                Thanks,
                Kris
