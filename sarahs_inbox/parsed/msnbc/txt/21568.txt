            I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team , and have no idea if drafts are in the
            works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don't know if
            something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




            Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
            this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
            thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.

             Sharon - pls keep me in the l oop as th is ring tweaked, and pls coordinate the effort
             so we're not all stepping on each other through the process.
