           Dear Governor Palin,




           I am writing you concerning two issues. The first being my request for additional funding
           for a playground in Akiak, Ak. on the Kuskowkwim River. Pls try to locate that e-mail
           sent at least (3) times and respond to it.




                                                                2




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0022111

           The second issue concerns the number of suicides the village of Akiak has experienced in
           the last six yrs the latest being a young man (18 ) last Thursday.  I believe it is almost
           becoming an epidemic--how sad. . Pls have someone contact the village and offer your help
           or the state of Alaska .  I am a former principal of Akiak and I personally knew the last
           ( 4) three which were former students of mine.




           Someone needs to offer them help.




           Thank you for your time.
