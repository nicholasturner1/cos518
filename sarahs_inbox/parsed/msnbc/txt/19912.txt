             Governor-

             The Daily News has a question about Wooten 's claim about moose permits . See below. Please advise on how to
             answer.

             Sharon: The past several days we have been going through all the materials in the Wooten investigative files. We
             came across something in the 9/14/05 interview of Wooten by Trooper Wall that we want to ask the governor
             about

             On page 11 of that transcript, when Wooten is being questioned about the moose hunting incident, Wooten
             asserts that Chuck Heath had said .he would use Molly's moose tag to take a moose if she didn't do it herself.

             Wall presses Wooten on that point.

             Wooten: ...he was going to take her tag and go fill her tag . With our without ah regardless of whether she
             went or not he was gonna go shoot a moose. Period.

             Wall: Did he tell that to MOLLY or you?

             Wooten: Me. And MOLLY was there too she heard it. He does it every year. He does it with SALLY's
             caribou tag. SARAH's caribou tag an...

             The union representative interjects at that point and they don't come back to it.

             Its my understanding that Gov. Palin received several Netchina Tier II permits. Did Chuck Heath ever take
             caribou using one or more of her permits, as Trooper Wooten seems to be saying here to the investigator? To the
             governor's knowledge, did Mr. Heath use Sally's permits as described by Wooten? To her knowledge, did he take
