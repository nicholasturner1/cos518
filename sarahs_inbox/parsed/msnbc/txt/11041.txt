              J- go ahead and keep the DNR meeting on my ached tomorrow - earlier (loam) if they can
              meet that early... it's an important meeting. So... It will have to be after that meeting
              that I return to the valley to get me and kids packed up for Juneau... I'll not be able to
              fly to Juneau until Saturday, 4pm. If that's a problem with the king air, then pls check
              commercial. Hopefully it is not a problem- I'm counting on king air to transport needed
              Juneau supplies.
