           Dear Governor Palin,

                  Sen. French called today he had two questions:

           1)       What did I think of the death penalty? I said I had no problem with it, however,
           should it come up it is a policy call for you.

           2)       He also is planning hearings on corrections next week and is planning to call one
           of my attorneys, Mr. Bodick (who is our corrections attorney), as a witness. I let Comm.
           Schmidt know.




                  See you in two weeks.
