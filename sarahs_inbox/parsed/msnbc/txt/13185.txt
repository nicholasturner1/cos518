            Subject:    State Selections /TAPS Corridor




           The Bureau of Land Management has just = published a public land order making 82,608 acres
           near Paxson available = for conveyance to the State under the Alaska Statehood Act. &nbs=
           p;



           At least one Alaska reporter has inquired about = the BLM decision and the relevant
           background.  So, I wanted you to = know.



           The modification of PLO 5150 to recognize the = State's previous selections is the product
           of a lengthy planning = process initiated several years ago .   The State originally asked
           the = Secretary of the Interior to release most of the lands in the TAPS - Corridor on the
           grounds that they are no longer needed for federal = purposes .   While the 82,608 acres is
           far less than the State = originally sought, it does represent high priority acreage for
           DNR.  =



           The BLM is unlikely to make additional lands = within the TAPS Corridor south of the Yukon
           River available for State = selection any time soon. However, it will commence a planning
           = process to consider acreage north of the Yukon which the State also would = like to
           receive.



           By separate email, I have advised other people = within the State administration of the
           BLM's decision.
