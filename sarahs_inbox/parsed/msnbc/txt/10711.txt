              Governor Sarah Palin



              After reading about you and your (honest) ways I must say I felt better knowing that there
              is someone in a Governorship that is leading by example and doesn't let politics stand in
              the way.  The residents of Alaska have someone in place that they can all be proud of.
              Happy Holidays to you, your family and staff.



              Respectfully submitted
