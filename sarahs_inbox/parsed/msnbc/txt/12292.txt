           Kris and Frank: I just     read my briefing paper for today's meeting I have with Darwin Biwer
           (from Darwin's Theory,     I presume). In this he says I called him during the campaign to
           request his assistance     in combating Knowles' effort to oppose gaming... and that "the
           problem never actually     came up but we were ready".



           Huh? Do you remember anything like that? I remember him coming to our office with a group
           of CHARR guys, and I remember calling him from a Southeast airport to say I couldn't
           support their expansion of gaming ideas. I think I made that call to return his, or
           because something about the gaming initiative had been in the paper that day?
