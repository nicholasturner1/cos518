MESSAGE:

I Just wanted to say Congratulations! to the Palin family on their new arrival. I am glad to hear that
she made it up to Alaska safely for the delivery. Will there be any sort of online book that Alaskans
can digitally sign or a place that we can send cards to? Our family is sending our prayers her way
and continuing to think fond thoughts. Thank You!
