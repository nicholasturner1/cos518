             Ongoing Disaster in Kivalina - Need for Action                                                  Page 2 of 2


             expensive project to relocate the AVEC tank farm in Kivalina, and in fact have received a
             "Kivalina Emergency ,Transfer Plan" (attached) from ADEC appropriating $25,000 to assist us
             in speeding up the fuel transfer if necessary. Of course, if the plan should be activated, ADEC
             has informed us that we would be billed for any expenditures they might make.

             The crux of the issue is that significant expenditures are being made by AVEC to respond to
             this ongoing disaster and, despite the Northwest Arctic Borough 's September 25th disaster
             declaration , there has been no action on the state 's part other than the above mentioned
             action by ADEC.

             By the attached latter , I am urging you to please take whatever action is necessary to assist
             AVEC and the community of Kivalina to respond to the untenable situation that we are in.

             Sincerely,
