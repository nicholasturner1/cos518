                  Sent:    Friday, April 18, 2008 8:25 AM
                  To:      Governor Sarah Palin
                  Cc:      Michael Tibbles; Sam Bishop ; Kris Perry
                  Subject: NGA/Natural Resources Committee


                This is Bre - Please note that I have corrected the spelling of Governor Rendell.



                We have been advised that the best way for you to communicate your interest in
                becoming the next Chair of NGA's Natural Resources Committee is for you to contact
                personally the incoming Chair and Vice Chair of NGA.

                Accordingly, set forth below are the coordinates for Governors Rendell and Douglas,
                respectively. The information is a bit disjointed, but it's the best we can obtain from
                their staffs.

                        Governor Rendell -

                                   Anne Shriver (Personal Assistant) - 717.787.2500 -
                                   ashriveQ,state. a.us
                                   Fax - 717.772.3155


                        Governor Douglas -

                                   109 State Street, Pavilion
                                   Montpelier, VT 05609.0101
                                   Phone - 802.828.3333
                                   Fax - 802.828.3339

                If you would prefer not to call them, I could put together a short note from you that
                could be emailed or faxed. In the alternative, I could call their staff people to
                express your interest, but this probably wouldn't be as effective as the
                other options.

                Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
