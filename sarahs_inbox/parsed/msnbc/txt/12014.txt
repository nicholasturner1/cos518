             Thank you!  And if CP is ticked that I told anyone I met with them, and they intend to
             punish us for it, then they've got strange tactics. My meeting schedule is a public
             document, for one.  Also, haven't they heard us say all along that we weren't doing
             anything in secret with AGIA?

              Nah- it was just my party yesterday, but the rest of the family enjoyed themselves and
             Grandma's cake she brought for the crew- they understood why I wasn't there. My real b'day
             is today so it was not a big darn deal to get that CP update accomplished yesterday - in
             fact I'm so glad we did it so I could hear it all for myself.
