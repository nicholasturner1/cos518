           MESSAGE:

           Gov Palin,



           I just read about the birth of your baby boy on Albert Mohler ' s website , and wanted to
           extend my congratulations from KY. My wife and I are expecting our second son this month
           so we both understand the happiness and responsibility of God's blessing of children and
           will pray for you and your family.



           Also, I wanted to commend you for doing what most people used to consider the right thing
           to do. I've had the pleasure of going to school with and worshipping with friends with
           Downs syndrome and have been blessed by their joy and their faith.



           Best regards,



           Phillip Allen
