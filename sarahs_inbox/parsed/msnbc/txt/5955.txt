         MESSAGE:

         Recently, I drove my mother to her home in Windber, Pa. I flew out of Johnstown, Pa on
         Saturday, June 16, 2007. A gentleman flying out of Johnstown lives in Windber, Pa. He
         was going to Fairbanks to visit his sons.

         One of the sons is part of your administration and is knowledgeable about the petroleum
         industry in Alaska.

         I am interested in contacting him, but I did not get the father's name.

         If you can be of assistance to me, I would be very thankful.

         Sincerely,

         Steve Zahurak
