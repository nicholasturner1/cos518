               Your comment about staying sane assumes your team started out sane. I am not sure that is correct :)   Appreciate
               the prayers! Tom

              Subject: Permanent OPA Director should not be Rachel Levitt


              Dear Mr. Nizich,
              I am writing to request that Ms. Rachel Levitt NOT be appointed as permanent Director of
              Office of Public Advocacy. I had professional interaction with Ms. Levitt regarding a. CASA
              case, to which I was the appointed CASA. It was for 2 small boys (infant and toddler) who I saw
              the foster mother abuse . I wrote a "whistle-blower," letter to Governor Palin , and was terminated
              as a CASA by OPA because I wrote the letter (I have this on tape). I was never interviewed by
              OPA, Marion Hallum, Rachel Levitt, or OCS. The doctor in this specific case had phoned OCS
              and told them to remove these children from this foster mother's home; I have the doctor also on
              tape, documenting this as factual . The children were allowed to remain in the abusive foster
              home, for an additional 9 months. I was terminated as the CASA, by Marion Hallum & Rachel
              Levitt shortly after knowledge of my letter to Sarah Palin; I was never contacted or interviewed
              prior to my termination as a volunteer CASA. After my termination, Ms. Levitt phoned my home
     1        and was rude and insolent to my young adult son (18 years); she demanded that she wanted to
              know who was at my home , who had answered my phone, who was home with my children,
              where I was, and how she could immediately contact me. When I spoke with her, she was
              unprofessional, raised her voice, and was rude in her demeanor (she accused me of lying that I
              did not have a CASA badge). Ms. Levitt is not the leader that the State of Alaska needs in this
              important position ; additionally, she was a," yes-man," for Mr. Josh Fink. There are many fine,
              experienced, qualified individuals who could lead the OPA; I firmly believe that Ms. Levitt
              should not be appointed permanently to this position . Thank-you for your time and
              consideration. I know this is a very difficult and hectic time for your office just now, but I could
              not let this go by.
              kindest regards,
