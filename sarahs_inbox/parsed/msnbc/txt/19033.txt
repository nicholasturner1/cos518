           Thank you, I'm anxious to get that public response out today, though. The letter tomorrow,
           but at least a short statement today. Sooner the better. If nothing else the response
           should be that I agree with Rep Don Young's comments he released on this yesterday.

           Subject: Rep Miller response




           Gov,



           We had an early morning meeting in coming up with a strategy for a response to Rep
           Miller's proposed federal legislation. The plan of action is as follows:



           Press release will be drafted today and be edited by this afternoon by all parties, Katz,
           F&G here, and Gov



           * distributed statewide

           * distributed to outside media outlets for national distribution




          Letter from the Governor to Rep Miller will address:



           * the 10 amendment

           * infringement on states rights
                                                                   1




                                                                                                              PRA_GSP01_0005621

           * specifics of the wolf control program

           * distinguishing between hunting and management control




           John Katz will be developing a      list of congressional members that will receive a cover
           letter from the Gov along with      the letter to Rep Miller as an attachment. The letter will
           be crafted within the next day      or so. We all decided that the letter should be thorough
           and so we did not want to rush      a letter out.




                                                              2
