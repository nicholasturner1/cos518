              Governor - I apologize - I just got off the phone w/Exxon and Marty Massey will not be available due to
              traveling tomorrow (Tues.). So, the best day would be Wed., or Thurs., (before the 10:00 a.m.
              testimony). If you are not available then they would like to do the preview courtesy with Comm. Galvin or
              Comm. Irwin, or Marty . I let them know that you would be In travel status yourself to the National
              Governor's Association meeting . Thanks, Janice
