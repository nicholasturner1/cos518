              are as concerned as n e is , at we're not the enemy, and that we've got excellent
              personnel and process in place now to help oversee potential problems... we're also
              willing to work with him to make oversight even better.



              Thanks for spending the time with him that you do, John (and others). Hope he appreciates
              it.

               DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

               December 21, 2007 6: 03 a.m.




                (Adds details, and comments    from congressman and BP.)     By Benoit Faucon of DOW JONES
               NEWSWIRES

               LONDON (Dow Jones)--A U.S. congressman said late Thursday he wants to obtain BP PLC's (BP)
               incident log book concerning a fire at its Alaska operation, after a critic's letter said
               subsequent repairs were more extensive than publicly known.

               The congressional request could be another headache for the British oil giant, which is
               still reeling from a part shutdown and the discovery of heavy corrosion at its Alaska
               giant oil field, Prudhoe Bay, as well as a deadly blast at a Texas refinery.

               In a letter sent this week to George Miller, D.-Calif., chairman of the U.S. House of
               Representative's Education and Labor Committee, BP critic Charles Hamel said repairs
               needed following an Aug. 6 fire at its Alaska operations were more extensive than publicly
               disclosed.

              A spokesman for Miller said, "We.continue to be concerned with safety issues at BP's
              Prudhoe Bay facility. We are preparing a request for the daily log" of operations at the
              facility where the fire took place.

              in addition, Hamel said members of a BP external board were steered away from the damaged
              area - even though the board was specifically hired to oversee the way BP deals with
              operational challenges.

              A SP spokesman refused to comment on the assertions contained in the letter.

              However, he said, "In addition to being thoroughly investigated by BP, the Aug. 6 turbine
              fire... was investigated by the state fire marshall and by the state petroleum systems
              integrity office."

              The fire, described as small by a Dow Jones Newswires report at the time, was one of five
              such incidents reported by BP between early August and early October at its Alaska fields.

              Hamel , who has passed information about safety issues at BP's Alaska operations to the
              media for many years, told Dow Jones Newswires that the alleged lack of public disclosure
              is only "the tip of the iceberg" and that more issues may surface regarding safety at BP's
              Alaska operations.

              As the head of the House committee overseeing workers' safety, Miller has kept closed tabs
              on BP's Alaska problems. This summer, the lawmaker said he was looking into allegations
              that BP had allowed nearly double the amount of compressed natural gas to build up in a
              processing facility, potentially putting workers in the vicinity at risk in event of an
              explosion.

                 GROWTH MODEL EXPANSION

                 In a December 7 letter to Chief State School Officers
                 (http://www.ed. gov/policy/elsec /guid /-secletter 071207.htm1), Secretary Spellings offered states an
                 opportunity to submit proposals that incorporate growth models into their current accountability
                 system. Such models allow states to receive credit for improving individual students ' performance
                 over time but retain the No Child Left Behind principles of annual assessment, disaggregation of data,
                 and grade-level proficiency for all students by 2014. To date, nine states have been approved to
                 implement their models under a pilot program established in November 2005. However, the pilot
                 was capped at 10 states . Now, based on the promising results of the pilot, the Secretary is opening
                 eligibility to all qualified states . "As I have consistently stated during our reauthorization
                 discussions, I believe that growth models promote two important goals," she noted. "First, growth
                 models allow states another effective way of measuring Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)....
                 Second, these models continue to expand the flexibility available to states under No Child Left
                 Behind." The approval process will be similar to the process the agency used for the past two years.
                 Proposals are due by February 1 . Department officials will conduct an initial review of each
                 proposal to make sure the growth model meets seven core principles and the state is making
                 progress in specific areas . If the agency has any questions about a state 's proposal, it will contact the
                 state by February 15 and ask the state to respond by March 14 . Then, those proposals determined
                 to have met requirements will be forwarded to a team of peer reviewers , who will meet during the
                 week of April 14- 18. The Secretary anticipates reaching a final decision by mid -May. FOR MORE
                 INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO http://www ed gov/admins /lead/account/ growthmodel/.
                 (Interested states are encouraged to review the Department 's peer review guidance for the pilot,
                 previous state proposals , and a document on cross-cutting issues identified by peer reviewers, all of
                 which can be found on the web site.)

                 Among the core principles for growth models is the ability to "track student progress as part of the state's
                 data system ." Yet, according to a recent survey by the Data Quality Campaign, only 34 states collect all of
                 the data they need to produce reports for growth models . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO

                 agency's 2007 Holiday Book Donation . The effort, a joint venture including the Department, the non-profit
                 entity First Book, and Random House Children ' s Books, is designed to provide brand -new, age-appropriate
                 children's books to schools , libraries , and literacy organizations serving low-income youth throughout the

                 year with the distribution of books to communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . Since June
                 2006, the Department , First Book, and various major book publishers have collaborated to distribute more
                 than two million children's books . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

                 TRANSFORMING HIGHER EDUCATION

                 On December 18, Secretary Spellings addressed a regular meeting of the National Advisory Committee on
                 Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), the appointed body that advises the Secretary on matters
                 related to accreditation and to the eligibility and certification process for institutions of higher education.
                 She used the forum to underscore the importance of transparency across higher education and to stress the
                 need to supply valuable information about colleges and universities so students and parents can make
                 informed decisions. "By law, student learning is a core part of accreditation ," she explained.
                 "Unfortunately, students are often the least informed and the last to be considered . Accreditation remains
                 one of the least publicized, least transparent parts of higher education, even compared to our Byzantine and
                 bewildering financial aid system. Most students don't know that different types of accreditation exist until
                 they encounter hurdles. Every year , millions repeat coursework because their credentials don't transfer." In
                 calling for changes , the Secretary emphasized she would never work to undermine the diversity or excellence
                 of America' s system of higher education . "Every institution has its own unique strengths and attributes,"

                 tobacco, and illicit drug use by American teenagers continues to fall overall . In fact, since 2001, use of
                 alcohol (including binge drinking) and cigarette smoking have decreased by 15% and 33%, respectively,
                 while use of any illicit drug has dropped by 24%. Moreover, use of marijuana, still the most widely used
                 illicit drug, dropped by 25%. On the other hand, prescription drug abuse remains a serious issue (use of
                 Oxycontin increased by 30% from 2002 to 2007), and attitudes toward ecstasy use have softened (eighth-
                 graders show a sharp erosion in perceived risk and disapproval). FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE

                 Barney does have a daydream where he is named a junior Park Ranger and congratulated by country singer
                 Alan Jackson ("OK, Barney, now you've gone country!") and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair ("As
                 someone born in Scotland, it's always good to see the Scots doing well!"). The video has cameos by
                 President Bush, First Lady Laura Bush, and Barbara and Jenna Bush. Don't miss the amazing soundtrack by

                  QUOTE TO NOTE

                 "If you ever doubt the need or appetite for your mission [accrediting colleges and universities ], consider the
                 U.S News & World Report college rankings. It's been called the 'swimsuit edition' of postsecondary
                 reporting. Within 72 hours of its release , the U.S. News web site was viewed 10 million times .... As I said
                 before, families know that selecting and paying for college is one of the most important decisions they will
                 ever make . They need and deserve the best information to guide them . They should be able to get it from
                 the people who make our higher education system the envy of the world."
