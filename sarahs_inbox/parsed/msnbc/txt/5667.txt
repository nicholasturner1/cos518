              Subject: MOVIE
             Regarding the movie producer, Sprocketheads says that it would be fantastic if you could
             still call the producer and say sorry that you were hosed by wind... look forward to you
             coming here... we're here for you... and appreciate your investment in the state (plus other
             information that I wrote earlier).

              On background , the producers just ate a ton of money ... about a half a million dollars In
              cancelling the shoot for the next two weeks.

             Thanks,
             Meg
