        Dear Mr. Saunders:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



       I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
       under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

       Governor

              First of all I would like to thank you for the hard decision you had to make with
        the budget.  Showing the strength I thought you had when I voted for you must be difficult
        at time.  Everyone with their hand out asking for state dollars instead of coming up with
        ways of making it on their own.

              I just retired from 21 years of active duty military service and I have decided to
        make Alaska my home. My wife and I built a house and really enjoy our lives here. After
        you were elected and you took office made this decision a lot easier.

              So with all this said I would like to say thank you. No complaints, no whining,
        just thank you.



        Sincerely,



        George Saunders
