         Joe and I are still in the office. Would it still be possible to visit in person for a
         short period? I can show you Franci's list as well as my draft of how we can get our
         people plugged in while meeting the statutory requirements for members.

         Who was the other farmer Franci suggested?            Has he been contacted? We don't want more of
         the same...

         FYI:     Don Dinkel and Kristan Cole were both Van Treeck fans in years

         gone by.     Both sat on the board with my father - in -law in years past

        at that was his take on their stance. Hopefully their opinion has

        changed over the years but if not we are back at square one.
