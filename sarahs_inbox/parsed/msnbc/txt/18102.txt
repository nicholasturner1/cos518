             Diana Straub (who presented herself as a personal friend) wants an appointment with you about a)
             District 14; and, b) giving you the guest book from the Inaugural Ball. I told her that in light of your very
             seriously overbooked schedule, she might expect a phone call from you instead of a formal meeting (and
             we could arrange to have someone like Kris Perry pick the book up). Her home # Privile ; her cell
            # Privilege . Was that the appropriate response to her? Kari.
