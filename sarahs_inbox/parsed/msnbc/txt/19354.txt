                    last two days are so contradictory and confusing to people . Truly, I've had more comments about us

                    Halcro's going to be a stinker too. For everyone's sake, including all public , we need to spend the

                    Funding , logistics slow cheers for in-state gas line
                    By Rena Delbridae

                    Published Wednesday, July 9, 2008

                    FAIRBANKS Gov. Sarah Palins proposed in-state gas line, unveiled Monday with some fanfare,
                    faces uncertain prospects with its funding and gas supply, according to some of those involved in the
                    project

                    Palin announced a public-private partnership between the state, Enstar Natural Gas Co. and the
                    Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority to build a small -diameter bullet line within the next five
                    years. The plan is to link Anchorage , Fairbanks and the North Slope in a way that will ease Fairbanks
                    home heating oil woes soon while opening a route for North Slope gas to reach Anchorage markets
                    in the long-term.

                    The smaller line eventually could serve as the in -state spur of a major pipeline , such as the one
                    proposed by TransCanada or the joint proposal by BP and ConocoPhilfps.

                    Officials with the state, Enstar and ANGDA agree the line would put infrastructure in place to allow
                    Alaskans to access their resources, but each party envisions that happening in a somewhat different

              Blank                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3




                  way. The state is hoping to send a signal to explorers that the market demands more gas, thereby spurring
                  new exploration and assuring a steady energy supply for Southcentral, said Joe Balash, special assistant to
                  the governor on oil and gas issues.

                  Enstar is looking to a line that could feed Anchorage markets with North Slope gas. as Cook Inlet contracts
                  become shorter and more difficult to arrange, said Curds Thayer, director of corporate and external affairs for
                  the utility.

                  And the voter-created ANGDA, which can access funding outside of the state treasury , said the bullet
                  line keeps Alaskas options open into the future, with the potential for boosting propane and liquefied natural
                  gas markets as well, said Harold Heinze, CEO.

                  How a spur line plays out could hinge on supply. Enstar and ANGDA seem less confident than the state that
                  Cook Inlet can continue supplying gas to meet needs, citing some lapses already at peak winter use in
                  Anchorage.

                  We have been unsuccessful in negotiating contracts over five years due to the deliverability of gas in the
                  Cook Inlet, Thayer said. Because of that, he added , Enstar has had to look elsewhere for gas sources. The
                  Anchorage-area utility serves about half of Alaskas population with 3,000 miles of distribution lines in
                  Southcentral

                  Do we want to roll the dice, or do we want to spend the money and build a line to the (North Slope) foothills?
                  Thayer asked. We know there is gas on the North Slope. The thing is, we dont have the gas in Cook Inlet.
                  The gas does not exist in Cook Inlet.

                  Fairbanks Natural Gas President Dan Britton said he , too, has questions about Palins proposal to deliver
                  Cook inlet natural gas to Fairbanks.

                  We are doing that today but struggle to get contracts for Cook Inlet gas, he said. Its hard for me to understand
                  what the justification might be for a multi-billion investment when youre unable to secure a longer gas supply.

                  One possible supply could come from Anadarkos development of the Gubik field in the North Slope foothills,
                  Thayer said. FNG also is turning to the North Slope, with plans to build a liquid natural gas facility in the next
                  few years and truck the product to Fairbanks markets.

                  Whether Palins bullet line stops at Fairbanks or reaches the North Slope depends on whether Cook Inlet gas
                  can supply the line and whether exploration underway in the Nenana and Copper River basins turns into
                  development according to an administration press release.

                  Heinze. of ANGDA. said a bullet line might bridge the gap for Fairbanks until a large line links the North Slope
                  with Canada and the Lower 48. He said the general view is that Cook Inlet has lots of potential but that he
                  and Enstar are somewhat more skeptical.

                  Enstar officials estimated Cook Inlet supplies could run out by 2014, he said.

                  There is no doubt there are some real problems, Heinze said. On the other hand, the administration is very
                  confident, and they are the landowner.

                  The governors office said it believes Cook Inlet has strong resources.

                  What were trying to do here is create access to markets for gas that we believe is in Cook Inlet, our
                  geol ists believe is in Cook Inlet. Its creating the opportunity for that gas to make it into the market and get
                  sold. Balash said.

                  Balash acknowledged that the proven reserves in Southcentral are failing into the nine- to 10-year range, but

                  he said a changing supply-demand ration may drive new exploration.

                  The Richardson Route was previously considered by ANGDA, and offers a known path and access to
                  potential military and industrial clients , while avoiding permitting problems that could crops near a national
                  park. Heine said. Exact routing is one of the things the team will have to discuss.

                  Progress of any kind probably wont be made until after the legislative special session on TransCanadas
                  pipeline proposal under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act wraps up this summer.

                  Balash expected the group to then iron out a timeline, evaluate financing options and decide how each party
                  can contribute.

                  We have a pretty healthy treasury and the ability to do some things, the luxury to do some things
                  now. he said. At the end of the day its likely that well be asking the Legislature for some form of
                  financial support or commitment or guarantees something that he lps bring surety to the project.

                  In Fairbanks, Britton said that once a larger supply of gas reaches the city, either through the bullet line or
                  trucked in as LNG, an expansion could be in order to the 50-plus miles of distribution line already in place.

                  The timing of expansion would depend on peoples interest level and the economics of the expansion, Britton
                  said. Conditions, roads and populations all figure into the cost equation, he said, although on average new
                  distribution may run $200,000 per mile.

                 Cook Inlet can continue supplying gas to meet needs , citing some lapses already at peak winter use in
                 Anchorage.

                 We have been unsuccessful in negotiating contracts over five years due to the deliverability of gas in the
                 Cook Inlet, Thayer said. Because of that, he added, Enstar has had to look elsewhere for gas sources. The
                 Anchorage-area utility serves about half of Alaskas population with 3,000 miles of distribution lines in
                 Southcentral.

                 Do we want to roll the dice, or do we want to spend the money and build a line to the (North Slope) foothills?
                 Thayer asked . We know there is gas on the North Slope. The thing is, we dont have the gas in Cook Inlet
                 The gas does not exist in Cook Inlet.

                 Fairbanks Natural Gas President Dan Britton said he, too, has questions about Palins proposal to deliver
                 Cook Inlet natural gas to Fairbanks.

                 We are doing that today but struggle to get contracts for Cook Inlet gas, he said. Its hard for me to understand
                 what the justification might be for a multi -billion investment when youre unable to secure a longer gas supply.

                 One possible supply could come from Anadarkos development of the Gubik field in the North Slope foothills,
                 Thayer said . FNG also is turning to the North Slope, with plans to build a liquid natural gas facility in the next
                 few years and truck the product to Fairbanks markets.

                 Whether Palins bullet line stops at Fairbanks or reaches the North Slooe depends on whether Cook Inlet gas
                 can supply the line and whether exploration underway in the Nenana and Copper River basins turns into
                 development, according to an administration press release.

                 Heinze, of ANGDA. said a bullet line might bridge the gap for Fairbanks until a large line links the North Slope
                 with Canada and the Lower 48. He said the general view is that Cook Inlet has lots of potential but that he
                 and Enstar are somewhat more skeptical.

                 Enstar officials estimated Cook Inlet supplies could run out by 2014 , he said.

                 There is no doubt there are some real problems , Heinze said. On the other hand , the administration is very

                 confident, and they are the landowner.

                 The governors office said it believes Cook Inlet has strong resources.

                 What were trying to do here is create access to markets for gas that we believe is in Cook Inlet, our
                 geologists believe is in Cook Inlet. Its creating the opportunity for that gas to make it into the market and get
                 sold. Balash said.

                 Balash acknowledged that the proven reserves in Southcentral are falling into the nine - to 10 year range, but
                 he said a changing supply-demand ration may drive new exploration.

                 The Richardson Route was previously considered by ANGDA. and offers a known path and access to .
                 potential military and industrial clients , while avoiding permitting problems that could crop up near a national
                 park. Heinze said. Exact routing is one of the things the team will have to discuss.

                 Progress of any kind probably wont be made until after the legislative special session on TransCanadas
                 pipeline proposal under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act wraps up this summer.

                 Balash expected the group to then iron out a timeline, evaluate financing options and decide how each party
                 can contribute.

                 We have a pretty healthy treasury and the ability to do some things , the luxury to do some things
                 now, he said. At the end of the day Its likely that well be asking the Legislature for some form of
                 financial support or commitment or guarantees something that helps bring surety to the project.

                 In Fairbanks, Britton said that once a larger supply of gas reaches the city, either through the bullet line or
                 trucked in as LNG , an expansion could be in order to the 50-plus miles of distribution line already in place.

                 The timing of expansion would depend on peoples interest level and the economics of the expansion, Britton
                 said. Conditions , roads and populations all figure into the cost equation , he said, although on average new
                 distribution may run $200 , 000 per mile.
