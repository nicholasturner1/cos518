           Governor - You just received a telephone call from an old classmate - Dane Tharp this a . m. He has been living
           in Texas for the past 25 years and just heard that you are Governor. He is up in Wasilla and when he heard that
           was like "wow" and would love a call from you if you have a moment . He also mentioned he would be at the fair
           today (Thursday). I wanted you to be aware as he probably will talk with you there. I did not mention that you
           would be there today. Thanks, Janice
