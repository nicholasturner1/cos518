          Hello Governor Palin, Our family wanted to congratulate you and your family on the birth
          of your son, Trig. Our fourth child, Daniel, was born with Down Syndrome, and we can't
          imagine our family without him. Recently, I met a mom with a 34-year-old daughter with DS
          and she said it best: "Don't you feel like you've been chosen to be a member of a very
          special club?" God bless your family, what a beautiful example of love you are to all who
          see you!  the Paul & Tricia Pietig family, Des Moines, Iowa
