            I want all funding stripped from the Carter Center. Meeting with the anti-Isreal, pro-
            terrorist group Hamas is an abuse of power and misuse of American dollars. In fact I
            concider it an act of treason. I will be sending you a copy petition I have signed and it
            will be presented to congress. Please
