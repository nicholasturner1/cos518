            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,



            Congratulations on the birth of your child!

            Thank you for standing up for life and not letting your child become an abortion
            statistic.



            I wish there were more like you in the political arena that stood up for the sanctity of
            life.



           May God bless you and your family!
