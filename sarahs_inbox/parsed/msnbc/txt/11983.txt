           Yes on canceling - can they understand that soldiers are just never usually singled out
           and highlighted? Track can't understand the interest. And he fears his superiors don't
           like this kind of stuff. And track's just a shy kid who really does not like this stuff.
           It's about family privacy too. And maybe Track has a point about Army's confidentiality
           with a soldier's orders.

          I jaut talked to track- he said this may tick off his leaders so really dreads it and asks
          that I not- says he will be treated differently if anyone makes a deal out of it and does
          not want any special treatment. I can't blame him

            I'll talk to them since I just got another comment re: questioning my support of him being
            in military (ie. perception that I haven't wanted to talk about it be I may not be
            supportive? Geeez ). I'll talk to them, put it to rest and show support for all military!
