          J- pls sched bill signing for right after dana's event- we'll run to that Anchorage eye
          conference and sign bill, then get on king air for Juneau so we don't have to arrive so
          late that evening in Juneau.

          Todd- what time does Willow wrap up her bball games on Sautrday? We'll leave for Juneau
          right after that (stopping in Anchorage for a bill signing   something to do with donating
          eye glasses). This is after Dana Lipse's ribbon cutting event for her new shop in Big
          Lake.
