I returned Suzanne's (Rep Meyer's cos) phone call yesterday re: the op-ed. Below is her response.

His office is saying they haven't heard from the 3rd floor re: a hearing request for this bill. I work on
hearing requests all the time. I'm more than happy to draft the language and send to Russ to
expedite the process-it will take 10 minutes tops, I know the bill backwards and forwards. I could
even send it to Kris to send to Russ as to not step on toes.

Ivy,

Thanks for the phone call yesterday . We appreciate it. The funny thing is , I went back and looked at
hearing requests that I have received , and we haven 't even received a hearing request from the
administration for HB 106.
