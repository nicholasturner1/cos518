            Subject: Anchorage Chamber Presentation Today
            Just proud to say that Kevin Banks did a fantastic presentation before the Anchorage
            Chamber of Commerce " Make-It-Monday " forum . He was a last- minute substitute who
            walked through a condensed AGIA PowerPoint presentation with ease and answered a half-
            dozen questions from the audience with grace.

            During this season of March Madness , it's great to be part of this team with such a deep
            bench.

            Go Hoyas - and AGIA,
            Meghan
