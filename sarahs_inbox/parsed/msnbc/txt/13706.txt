             And pls tell her Todd and I will personally donate of course. I wanted you to see, too,
             that she says Britta's excited to work for us! I know Janice had thought Hannah's
             replacement should "train" in Juneau - don't know how necessary that is unless it's just
             for a couple of days at most.



             Did Kel do well in your/ FB's meeting ? FB was going top give me details.

             Hi Sarah,

            The committee for Grad Blast is seeking donations for this year. If you and Todd could
            help out it would be greatly appreciated. (Even tho we don't have graduates this year -
            they are looking for any help they can get..) I REALLY appreciated Todd's help with clean
            up last year in the wee hours!! I had peace of mind knowing both Britta and Track were in
            a safe place and they seemed to have a good time. How relative that concept of "safe"
            seems now ! Hoping this finds you feeling well as you power through these last days before
            you get a "break"!



             Britta is excited to look forward to working for you and is counting the days and weeks
                                                                    1
