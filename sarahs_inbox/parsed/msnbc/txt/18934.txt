           Sure be I am not clear on what the issue is or what I'm missing, so I'd better attend the
           iogcc functions tonight instead

           Governor - I spoke to Katz and he does not feel it necessary that you participate in the
           conference call this evening. He recommends that I let them know that your staff will
           follow-up with Perdue's office tomorrow morning. Please let me know if that is acceptable
           and I will send an email.
