            Before I talk to him, is there anything new? I don't have any budget paperwork in front of
            me- but I do want to call Loy (Sharon - what's his #?), so feel free to email any
            new/additional / reminder points we ' re trying to relay.

            Governor - I know this weekend is probably packed, but if you have 10 minutes, Wesley
            would love a call.

           I'd like 10 minutes or so with Gov. Palin to talk about the state budget situation.




           I'm writing a story for our Sunday newspaper that will attempt to place in broad context
           the positions of the governor and the Legislature on budgeting this year, particuarly with
           respect to capital spending.




           I'd like to ask Gov . Palin about her fundamental goals for state spending , and whether she
           believes we're headed toward a defining moment between herself and lawmakers.




           I expect this will be a prominent story.




           Ideally, I'd like to do this interview today or this evening, though I realize the
           governor has a full schedule. A Saturday interview would work.




           My contact numbers are below.




           Thank you and Gov. Palin, Sharon!




          Wesley
