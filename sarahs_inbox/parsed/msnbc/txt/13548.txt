             Hilarious!



             Reminds me of the Homer Library luncheon where Lt Gov Leman's lunch barely fetched $200,
             and Candidate Palin ' s lunch fetched $650 for the Library Foundation.



             John and Nicole? Harris is married??

             Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items
             was a package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7 , a stay at Pikes and lunch
             w/Binkley and his wife . It was secured by John and Nicole Harris . There was only one
             bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1 , 500. :)
