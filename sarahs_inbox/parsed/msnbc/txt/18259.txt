         Dear Ms. Mattson:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control , manage our revenues and resources efficiently , and cut wasteful spending.




         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

         Thank you for you vetoes on the buget. We are glad someone finally took a stand on funding
         that is ever growing.

        We will be watching the "necessary" programs that lost funding and will donate what we can
        towards deserving ones. That is the way these programs SHOULD work.

         Thank you again for looking out for our children and their children.

        Loretta Goldie Mattson - 42 year resident of Alaska.
