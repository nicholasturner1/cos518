         Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time i s over ue             o move on.



         What process are you, as COS, using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
         hands (I spoke with Emil about Privile a yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
         Leo about ^.. I'll cc them in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
         the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



         I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks' service has
         ended. If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
         overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged orPersonalF
        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


        Thanks
