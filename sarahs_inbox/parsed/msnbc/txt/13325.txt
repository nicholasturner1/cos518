             Kris pls call the DC person so they're not ticked at me. Explain I have a five day old
             preterm baby and won't be flying this weekend.

             Janice make sure this weekends events know its not a done deal it depends on trigs next
             coupla doc appts . I'll try.

            And anyone know what the student event is in wasilla tomorrow? It can't be my highest
            priority and I doubt I'll go be of other higher priorities with AGIA and pt thomp.

            Governor - I will cancel all of DC. Hannah will confirm the Motorcycle Blessing Event and
            let the Slush Cup folks know that you will be attending with the First Family. Please see
            options below that were regretted due to you being in DC. If we need to change these
            please let me know.
