              MESSAGE:

              My name is Cpl. Scott E. Kelley and I am currently deployed in Iraq and some of-my fellow
              Marines had told me that their state had a program where they would send the state flag to
              deployed service members I was wondering if Alaska had this program I was born in Alaska
              and lived there for many years but I am currently stationed in North Carolina. If we do
              not have this program I would like to request a flag be sent to me if that is at all
              possible my mailing address is as follows:
