            There is still the misperception out there in the press that my sister is going through
            divorce proceedings and/or a custody battle. Not true-it's all been concluded... they've
            been divorced for some time now and the judge sided with Molly in the custody battle.
             (It's all the more reason to ask why I'd fire Walt for reasons pertaining to Wooten's
            personal life when it's impossible to fathom any reason to meddle is a closed case and
            potentially do harm to the party I allegedly sided with?)

               Another misperception by reporters is that the concerns over Wooten were recent, and
            were recently brought to Walt's attention (while I was governor). The concerns were
            outlined back in '05. I reminded Walt of them IN ANSWER TO HIS QUESTIONS about my need for
            security detail (as all governors are asked)... and the conversation with Walt was at the
            behest of the security detail personnel who asked that I share my safety concerns re:
            Wooten's outrageous threats with the DPS commissioner. I complied with their request, as
            did Todd (Bob Cockerall ahd asked Todd to bring to Walt's attention the concerns). This
            all happened early on.

            With press avail we'll need DPS budget summary again, press bullets and presser... all on
            hand to distribute (anticipating we'll be asked about Walt during the AGIA press avail).
            Thanks!

              Sharon-pls make sure mcAllister sees.
