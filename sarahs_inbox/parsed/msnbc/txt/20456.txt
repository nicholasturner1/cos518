          MESSAGE:

           The environment surrounding Haicro's anger is polluting the



          air in Alaska. Anger only destroys the container it is in.



          Wrote to KHopkins to email me next time Halcro is on front



          page of ADN so I can throw it in the garbage before



          I read any more of his trash.



          Governor Palin just keep smiling. Halcro will get



          what goes around one day.
