           Wanted to do bridge naming bill w Rhonda in Nenana. Others on this list have been
           discussed for venues that would allow me to travel and do some creative things like the
           well baby exams. I realluy need to get to Peninsula and Frbnks and elsewhere and some of
           these bills provide good reasons to do so. I'll let others strategize on these too as I
           type my speech for tomorrow.

           Governor,



           After tomorrow, we will have 10 bills to sign by next Wednesday, June 4th. With AGIA
           being the main focus, I thought it might be a good idea to schedule one-hour on Wednesday
           morning and possibly a media event at noon in Juneau for bill signing. I have already
           checked with Janice and your schedule is available as long as you are in Juneau.



           DATE:                                  Wednesday, June 4th

           TIME:                                   9am (1 hour)

           WHERE:                              Governor's Office, Juneau (In-house, no media)



           BILLS TO BE SIGNED W/ SPONSORS:

                       SB 57   Elton                  Marine parks additions (Elton has requested a
           signing at the University but time is too tight)

                          SB 119 Olson                    School library grants

                          SB 158 Kookesh               Shirley Demientieff memorial bridge

                          SB 164 McGuire                Used motor vehicle sales

                          SB 170 McGuire                Insurance coverage for well-baby exams

                          SB 211 Davis                    Aggravating factor: homeless

                       SB 214 Huggins             Hunting by military; Coast Guard (unless this is
           signed in a ceremony on Monday, the 2nd)

                         HB 268 Stoltze                   Burning motor vehicles on public lands



           BILLS TO BE SIGNED W/O SPONSORS:

                         SB 8       Davis                   Mental health patients right to pick gender of
           staff (0-
                  rivileaed or Personal Materm
                       SB 101 Ellis                         Guardianship & Conservators (already did a
           ceremonial signing for the bill)



           Another alternative would be to pull all/any bills to do with crime and hold one media-
           related signing ceremony in Juneau - probably the Governor's Conference Room unless

                                                                  2




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0018389

           Commissioner Monegan has a better idea - relating to crime issues. This ceremony could be
           sent out as a media advisory etc. If you'd like to do this, we'd need 30+ minutes on the
           same day, Tuesday, June 4th to sign SB 211 (above), HB 268 (above), SB 265 (Criminal
           omnibus bill), and perhaps HB 88 (TVs/monitors in vehicles), HB 193 (Police Standards
           Council), HB 286 (impersonating a public servant), and a few others I'll discuss with DPS.



           If you like this as well, we could do this around the lunch hour so legislators could
           attend and not miss AGIA hearings: Wednesday, June 4th at noon for 30+ minutes.



           Please let me know how you would like to proceed.



           Thanks, Kelly



           PS After this grouping is attended to, the next set of 14 bills will be due by Monday,
           June 9th; although not all require a signing event.
