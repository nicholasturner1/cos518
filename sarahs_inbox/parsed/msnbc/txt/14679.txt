            Subject:                 THANK YOU


            Governor Palin, Senator Kookesh, Speaker Harris, Representative Thomas,

            Members of the Marine Transportation Advisory Board, and all your

            superstar support staff:



            On behalf of the Native Village of Eyak and the Community of Cordova and

            very personally, I would like to thank the State of Alaska and the Alaska

            Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and the Alaska Marine

            Highway System for the return of the FVF Chenega to service in Prince

            William Sound today.



            The maiden voyage for the season leaves the Cordova dock this morning

            under fair weather. I send my personal congratulations for the safe

            voyage across the gulf and successful training these past weeks. I wish

            the vessel and crew a safe and prosperous year in Prince William Sound.



            This service means a lot to our community and I thank you for the hard

            work and years of planning that have gone into this effort. Keep up the

            good work.




            Bruce
