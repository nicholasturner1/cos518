             Dear Sarah,

             While crusing through the news, I heard of the birth of child and wanted to congratulate
             you and husband. I am sure your youngest son will excel in his world and provide you will
             infinite amount of love, as well as become a valued member of the community.



             I feel that I have some expertice on the . subject , as I am the sibling of a lady with Down
             Syndrome . She is 47 yr. old and has lived with me for 4 years .    Never let any doctor or
             expert limit the potential of such a wonderful little boy.




             Good health to all,

             Sherrie Nevill
