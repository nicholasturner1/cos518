           if that sounds good...  unless we hear otherwise. Thanks, E

            Could u ask her to prepare something that I could bring to Sen. Dyson's morning meeting
           tomorrow in his office? It's a morning mtg that I'd guess includes about 20 people- I'll
           check for sure but we'll assume 20 for now. Thanks
