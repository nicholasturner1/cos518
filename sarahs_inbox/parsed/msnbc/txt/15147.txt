            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin:



            This week, an article was published on our weekly catholic newspaper "El
            Visitante",explaining the special condition of your son Trig, and your attitude of
            accepting his condition as a gift from God.



            My wife and I would like to congratulate you on your decision,               as we went through the same
            situation some years ago.



            If we were residents of Alaska, we would be very proud of our governor.



            Sincerely:



            Robert & Noemi Rodriguez

            Manati, Puerto Rico




                                                                  1
