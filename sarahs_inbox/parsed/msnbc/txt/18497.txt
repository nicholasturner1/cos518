              Subject: Chuck Hamel


             Chuck Hamel asked me to convey his hope that you will not be angry with him for
             his latest efforts to apprise members of Congress and government regulators of
             continuing problems with the Alyeska pipeline and BP's management of North Slope
             infrastructure.

             I told Chuck that I doubted that you would ever be upset about a private citizen
             bringing his concerns to the Federal and State governments with the expectation of
             review and remedial action, if appropriate.

             Chuck disagrees strongly with DNR's characterization of the current Alyeska
             situation and has communicated this to Congressman John Dingell, Chairman of
             the House Energy and Commerce Committee. I have attached a copy of Hamel's
             letter for your ready reference and have apprised Tom Irwin of Hamel's response.


             Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
             iwkatz@alaskadc.org. Thank you.
