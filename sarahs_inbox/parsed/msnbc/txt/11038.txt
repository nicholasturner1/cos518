              Yes- that's the difference. And even his friend, Stevens, agrees that we can't rely on
              those earmarks.



              Last night was a fun event - and Lyda evidently lied on the news again last night,
              claiming I was verbally invited to her fundraiser... I'm checking with Mike on that
              because he either he never passed that on and he's heard me publicly say that only Gene
              gave an invite, or lyda is again being deceptive.

              I read Carl Marrs' column this morning and have to say that I love the contrasting vision
              you've painted for Alaska in the State of the State.
