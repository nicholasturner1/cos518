          MESSAGE:

          Saw you on Glen's show the other night. I just wanted to let you know that I think you are
          awesome and would love to do anything I can to aid you in the fight to thrive off domestic
          oil as opposed to begging Arab nations for theirs. I really respect that you are balancing
          a young family and a huge state at the same time. Congratulations on the recent birth of
          your son, I myself became a first time father about a month ago. Again, thank you so much
          for being a one in a million governor who is willing.to do SOMETHING while the rest of the
          government watches the price at the pump sky rocket. I've always wanted to live in Alaska,
          but my wife is terrified of bears, she'd never allow it. I have a hard enough time
          convincing her to go to Yellowstone every summer. Again, if there is anything I can do on
          my end to help your fight just let me know. Keep up the good work, you are awesome.-
          Justin Reeves
