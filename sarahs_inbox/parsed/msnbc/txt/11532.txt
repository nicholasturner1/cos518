             I may be wrong on rfn. But it is someone who gets it first and blasts us- but still says
             good thing about some in admin.

            No I don't know ho he is although I thought he was a supportive one. Now I'll go back and
            re-read his posts. On the press release distribution list, I'm sure that leg offices are
            on that list i.e. Speaker Harris, etc. But I wouldnt be surprised if there are people w/no
            need to be on there. Anxious to hear what SHaron says.

            Kris.. .did we know who rfn was?



            My understanding was that there were non-media types on that press release mailing list
            also-and that it was a compilation of a few media lists (sounded like a mess last year
            when I tried to find Juneau-only media.. .gave up and just built one myself).



            It'd be interesting to see what Sharon turns up. It'd be very easy for a mole to get on
            that list.. .they probably just emailed and asked to get on it.

             Unless I'm mixing up bloggers here - here's my take on something fishy:

            There's a blogger named rfn. He started off as a big supporter, now he's a critic who
            picks and chooses what issues to support us on. This morning he posted the press release
            we sent out 4:45pm yesterday on Conoco"s response... and added that, essentially, I over-
            react and panic with responding via pressers -like it's a bad thing. How would this
            blogger have received the emailed presser unless he's a valid media person (and why would
            a legit media person bother to be a regular blogger?), or one of our folks sent it to him?



            Strange thing is yesterday it was one of our folks who, as he does so often, warned me I'd
            again look like I was over-reacting... and he did not want any pressers going out... He
            cautions often that it doesn't do any good and even though he say he agrees with me that
            we should be communicating more often and clearer with the public, he is very, very
            hesitant to ever want pressers or statements going out in response to timely issues.

             Trying to put two and two together here, trying to remember if this is the blogger who
             criticizes me but says very supportive things of a select few in the administration.
