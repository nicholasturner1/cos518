MESSAGE:

Hi Governor Palin,



I was writing to congratulate you on your new baby boy. I was thrilled to hear that you were pregnant
and suprised and excited yesterday, when I heard that you had delivered. I am in the eighth grade
and really enjoy little kids. I am just so excited to have such a beautiful governor, with an adorable
little baby. I hope that sometime in the future you can bring Trig to Seward, so I can see him. Good
Luck!



Michaela
