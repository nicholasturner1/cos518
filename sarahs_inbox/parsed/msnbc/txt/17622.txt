             I heard back from Mayfield . He finally sent us a recommendation for the Children 's Trust. He's also
             going to send some names for the Community Service Commission re: youth member between 16-25.
             Very exciting to finally tap into his expertise. Her name is Privileged or Pers Kris do you know her?
             Governor, I will include her information in our meeting on Thursday . I have the final list for the Health
             Council , MTAB and some small housekeeping items.

             Also Kris , can we touch base some time this week to find a date when the governor is going to be in
             Southcentral so we can coordinate some type of event for her appointments ? Good to talk to you tonight.

             You guys are awesome.
