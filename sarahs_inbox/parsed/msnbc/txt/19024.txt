           Our response needs to be a definitive YES, we're on it... Just like the response to Ramras
           was YES, we're on it (and the troopers will be at the meeting...).

          GARA, CRAWFORD URGE ACTION AGAINST VECO

           Democratic legislators say illegal campaign activity was extensive

         ANCHORAGE -- On Tuesday Reps Les Gara and Harry Crawford ( both D-Anchorage ) sent a letter
         urging the Alaska Public Offices Commission and Attorney General to take more aggressive
         action against VECO , and the candidates helped by illegal VECO activity , for a broad array
         of illegal political activities . APOC has declined to take meaningful action in pursuing
         VECO campaign donations , and claims it is limited by a one-year statute of limitations.

          Gara said the statute of limitations is bogus, since the activities were criminal in
         nature . Under Alaska law, criminal violations of Alaska ' s campaign laws are subject to a
         five-year , not one year statute of limitations . He and Crawford also said the extent of
         VECO's violations went well beyond illegally paying for political polls . The State should
         also determine which candidates knew they were benefiting from VECO ' s illegal campaign
         donations - conduct for which the public deserves an answer.

          "VECO has corrupted the political system , and finding reasons to take no action isn't
         acceptable ," Gara said. In addition to the illegal polling payments Gara said VECO also
         used corporate money to pay for campaign fundraisers , and that the company also used
         corporate funds to compensate its executives for campaign contributions they made -
         essentially resulting in direct campaign donations from VECO to Republican candidates. The
         fact that VECO knew is was violating campaign law makes the act criminal , according to
         Gara and Crawford.

          "Investigating VECO is only the beginning as far as I ' m concerned," Crawford said. "The
         people who accepted these illegal bribes are equally culpable , and I won ' t be satisfied
         until the political system in Alaska is cleaned up - inside and out."

          Gara and Crawford are asking APOC and the AG for a full investigation of VECO' s illegal
         political activity and a prosecution for any crimes the company committed. The two
         Democratic legislators sponsored legislation last year that now makes it illegal to bribe
         legislators with campaign contributions . Prior to the passage of that bill, bribery was
         against federal law, but not against Alaska law.
