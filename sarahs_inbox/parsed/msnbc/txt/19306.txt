             Governor - Good Morning and Welcome to Sunny Juneau!

             I just received a phone call from the 4" of July Parade Committee here . They had heard that you may be
             in town and would like to extend an offer to you. They have a 64 Thunderbird Convertible that is available
             for you to ride through the Parade in. You would need to be available tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m. to
             do this. Harrison Ford is rumored to be here also (sighting at Baranof Hotel) and they have asked that he
             ride in Parade but because of Security they say he has already left town.

             I also just talked with Bob (ANC office ) and he checked on the Caravan for July 20. This would be from
             Wasilla Airstrip to the Fairbanks Picnic and then to Chena Hot Springs . The Caravan is available at that
             time. From Wasilla to Fairbanks is approximately 1.5 hours. Fairbanks to Chena Hot Springs is 20
             minutes. The plane can overnight or come back the same evening.

             Thanks, Janice
