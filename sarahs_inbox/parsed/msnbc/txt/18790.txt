          She was probably referencing you "being seen with a certain individual..."                      as me! :)




          And I concur with you - I haven't heard any coup-talk.

          Lyda called and asked me whether I had had any recent conversations related to a coup. She
          said I had been seen " with a certain individual ." I told her I had just completed a road
          trip with Gene Therriault through his district ( schools , troopers , roads, etc .) And that
          no conversation like that came up.



           She asked further whether I knew anyone in the Administration who was having such
          discussions ... and I was able to say no . She's extremely uncomfortable at this moment. Just
          thought you all should know.
