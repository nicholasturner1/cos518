         Governor - In looking at scheduling requests for this next Thursday,

         Sept. 27 you have asked to be scheduled at the Bouchercon 2007

         Convention Opening Reception.           They have asked you to welcome guests and

         give "pardon" to all the crime fiction writers for all the murders

         committed in their writing.           AG Colberg asked if you would be attending

         also.



         The football dinner for a Thursday, would best fit into the schedule for

         Thursday, October 4 (this is the teams pre-play off dinner), so would be

         fitting.     Janice
