              Governor - You have had access to make appointments on your calendar for several months
              per our computer folks. You are not able to make appointments from your blackberry at
              this time . This is something that we can have changed just for you .  I have a lap top
              that I leave at home that lets me go directly into the calendar and make changes.



              Kris - I am sure you already know how to go in and make appointments - please email or
              call and I can walk you through it if you have any questions.



              The only other people on your calendar that has accessibility to schedule is I, Hannah,
              and Sunny . Mike Tibbles has viewing rights only .  Janice

              Don't know yet - depends on when I arrive and what all I have on the plate.



              Also, pls ask whomever is in charge of calendar that Kris and I both need access to data
                                                                      1
