           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin,

           I read with dismay this morning of the conflict between your office and the Senate
           Leadership regarding the time of your State of the State Address. I didn't vote for you
           in the last election, but your actions since taking office have clearly earned my vote
           next time.  Track's graduation from Basic Training is clearly a monumental event, please
           thank him for his dedication and service to our country. The priorities for you must be
           clear, I can't imagine you anywhere besides at his upcoming graduation. The Senate
           Leadership is simply being nothing less than unreasonable.  My family is completely
           supportive of you giving your speech at 6:00PM as you had previously scheduled, regardless
           of who is in attendance. As Alaskans we'll be listening and my respect for you will only
           be increased by your decision to support our state and your family. As I said you've
           already earned my vote and your continued hard work only makes me prouder to have you
           serving as our Governor.



           Thank you for your continued hard work and please thank your family for their sacrifices
           and sharing you with our great state,



           Michael A. Davidson
