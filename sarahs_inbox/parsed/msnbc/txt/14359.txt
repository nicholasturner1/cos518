               Governor,

               I spoke with George Wuerch last night and he informed me that he will be resigning from the KABATA Board. He
               would like his effective date to be soon but left that up to us. I discussed the option of him sending his letter
               Monday and his resignation effective the end of the month (Wednesday). I am not sure that the timing matters all
               that much but the end of the month option makes sense. If that is OK with you, I will call him back to confirm.

               George feels like his has put his time in on this one. He said he and Barbara are going to travel for a few months
               and would be unavailable. Confidentially, he shares some of our concerns about the RFP but he is not going to
               put out a statement and said he will try to avoid any media attention about his departure.

               Mike
