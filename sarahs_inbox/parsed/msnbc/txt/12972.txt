              Ask Todd if he needs them shipped or can wait until I bring them- for free- on thursday. I
              did not know we didn't have that bookcase full of the manymore.

              We have approx. 1 dozen books left at the Mansion for distribution. I

              have the new book marks signed (70) and will ship up to ANC office

              today.     Janice

             Todd and Willow will be visiting classroom(s) on Wednesday, maybe one

             day before that too. We'll look for bookmarks for them to hand out in

             the Anchorage office, and we'll need a load of those kid books from the

             mansion to be transported here so we have them to distribute outside of
                                                                    1
