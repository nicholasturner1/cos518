         Subject :                  Knik and Gravina Re: Meeting Wednesday August 1


         Im sure we can find time - and as for Kabata, I hope folks know my intention is to
         continue to NOT support the nonsensical notion that the state can fund Gravina and/or Knik
         Crossing. If the feds can't fund these projects that have minimal public support, then
         they're not going to happen.




         I am very frustrated to hear that funds are being spent on Gravina , still, yet the project
         does NOT have my support be of the funding issues , long-term.



         Mike - PLEASE tell DOT their actions   makes us look inconsistent (and clueless) and
         Federal officals will take it out on us with future funding requests be of all the
         "problems" we're having to clean up - including corruption and missplaced priorities from
         the past.

        Dear Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles, I will be in Juneau tomorrow, Wednesday August 1, is
        there a time when we could meet to review:

             The Marine Mammal Protection Act

                 The latest request on KABATA and the report I have on what is likely coming

             The plan of action I have for the VECO matter based on our last meeting, it is a two
        page memo which I would like to confirm your approval of before I initiate it.

              Any time tomorrow would be fine. Thanks



              Talis
