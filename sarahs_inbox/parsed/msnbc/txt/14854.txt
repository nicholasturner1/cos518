            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov. Palin,




            I just read the article about you and your baby in this morning's Anchorage Daily News. I
            am a retired teacher and counselor in Alaska and I have a niece with a Down Syndrome baby,
            so I have learned a lot about the special needs of these children. I am also a mother and
            a grandmother.



            These are my qualifications to offer assistance to you if you need help with child care,
            extra time with physical therapy for Trig, or just the holding and love that they need.
            The first year is crucial in giving all babies a good start in life, and these children
            need that much more.



            I can't keep up with whether you are in Anchorage or Juneau, but if your office is
           primarily in Anchorage and there is a group to do this, I would welcome the opportunity to
           spend some time each week helping in any way needed. (But I can't run the state!)



            Sincerely,



            Patricia Koch



                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 0017064
