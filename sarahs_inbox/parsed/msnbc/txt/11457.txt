            Kris , You should be receiving some gasline memos shortly fr a friend . Please handcarry to
            Joe Balash . Let him know they were given to us and I didn ' t know whether our gasline team
            has seen them . They have to do with Legis Council consultants talking about TC's proposal
            supposedly being contingent on a few items.
