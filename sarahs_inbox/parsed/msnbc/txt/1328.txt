I am a recall agent with Dorel Juvenile Group , I also process the car seat registration cards, it was
quite a surprise to receive a registration card from the Governor of the Great State of Alaska. Many
years ago my uncle left Indiana to work on building the railroad in Alaska , his name was Jesse
Beach , his home town was Talkeetna . I will never be able to visit your wonderful state, but you have
revived many good memories of stories my uncle used to write . If I can ever be of assistance please
let me know with any baby products , please let me know . You can reach me at (812 )343-1277
cphone , or my email . Have a great day.
