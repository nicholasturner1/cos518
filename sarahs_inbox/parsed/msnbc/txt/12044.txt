               Gov. Palin,

               So it showed up in the news here that Track is stationed at Wainwright. I thought
               that he might need a church. If he is interested, I suggest Door of Hope, where I
               go.  It is similar to Juneau Christian Center, has large young adult and military
               populations, and offers Saturday night services if he wants to avoid early
               mornings.

               Robb
