           Pat and Mike - in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd , I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks , and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event "out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate, and was I not supposed to announce ? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea , I would have been told?




          I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
         together in the past , except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
         Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate , hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
         smaller communities for an event.



          If this was " hijackiing " it or it was out of line, surely someone would have told me what
         the protocal was?
