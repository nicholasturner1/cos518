              Subject: HB 4002 - Resource Rebate
              Governor

              Both Co-Chairs of the C & RA committee, Rep. LeDoux and Rep. Fairdough and some members of
              House leadership, Rep. Olson, Rep. Chenault? want to amend the resource rebate bill as follows:

                1. Add the $1,200 per person resource rebate payment as a separate line item on the PFD checks
                   and check stubs / 1099's (for people that get direct deposit)

                2. Not have any supplemental application process for persons that did not qualify for a 2008 PFD.
                   (This removes an estimated 40,000 persons that our supplemental process in our bill are estimated
                   to pick up). This would save 40,000 x $1,200 in payments (over $40 million) and the $500,000
                   cost of Revenue to running the new resource rebate program. These are persons in Alaska who
                   don't qualify for a PFD because they have not been here long enough, etc).

                3. So that we do not miss veterans who receive VA benefits that are reduced by PFD payments so
                   they do not even apply for the PFD and would otherwise be left out in the cold by limiting the
                   $1,200 to persons getting PFD's, they would creates a new alternative payment program for just
                   those veterans. The cost for picking up the veterans alone is probably under $7 million.

              In my opinion, we cannot get the bill out of the committee without these amendments but will defer to
              Kelly on her measure of the committee.
