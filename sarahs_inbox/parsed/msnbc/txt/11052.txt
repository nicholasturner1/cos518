                  Amazing. And Neanderthal. Does he believe Sen Stevens is wrong, then, in
                  warning us not to be so reliant? If you have a second to jot a response, please do
                  so iwe have it in my back pocket. This could be a good venue to prove my
                  support/ agreement with Sen Stevens' and Rep Young's message and mission to
                  get us off the Fed dole to a greater degree - we have no choice, its going to
                  happen- and I don't want Alaskans worried or dreading that day. We're being
                  proactive.

                   Yes, a response would be great.
