            MESSAGE:

            We extend prayers and best wishes upon the birth of your newest son, Trig (a good
            Scandinavian name :-)  It was great to see him on the news last night (april 23). He is a
            cutie.  We really appreciate your devotion to him and your willingness to commit to him
            and his needs (not that you wouldn't). In this day and age, it isn't always so. Be
            assured of our prayers for you and Todd during the years to come.



            A comment on the Juneau power disaster - if the loss of Juneau's hydro is declared a
            disater, what does that say about the rest of Alaska where the high costs of diesel
            generated power are an everyday occurance? in Glennallen we pay much more in fuel
            surcharge than we do for the power itself. I know .... we choose to live here, but .....
