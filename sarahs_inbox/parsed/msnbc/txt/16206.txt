           Good morning -



           Mindy is in possession of two bills which come due tomorrow , June 21st, and need the
           Governor's signature.



           HB 305 - Rep Meyer's bill to restrict campaign fund raising (the LeDoux bill)

           HB 419 - Rep Meyer's bill on state lease-purchase             agreements



           In addition , the following bill is also due on the 21st and will be in Juneau sometime
           late this afternoon.

           HB 373 - H FIN -- school bond debt reimbursement - planned for a ceremonial signing at
           Wasilla Chamber on Tuesday



           Just want to be sure we all know that the Governor needs to sign ALL 3 bills before she
           leaves Juneau.



           Thanks, Kelly
