                FYI:  This is a copy of a letter I just sent to Senator Green

                Subject:     Every vote counts

                Senator Lyda Green:

                You are elected to represent your district and from what I can see you are doing a
                lousy job of it. You certainly are not representing me! I am totally disgusted
                with your self serving antics in opposing Governor Palin every opportunity you can
                manufacture.  She is doing a magnificent job of representing her constituents by
                soliciting their opinions and then implementing what is possible.

                Instead of acting like a prima donna who has been deposed, it would serve you
                better to try cooperation instead of grandstanding defiance. I am aware that your
                shenanagins gain you free publicity, which in an election year can be worth a lot.
                But, it would behoove you to stop and think that perhaps that is not the kind of
                publicity that will get you re-elected this year.

                A disgusted VOTER!!

                cc:     Governor Pali
