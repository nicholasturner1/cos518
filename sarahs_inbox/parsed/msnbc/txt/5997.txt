          Hi Merrick - I read your email re : editorial - thank you for your awesome encouragement
          and defense!



          It was the oddest editorial board mtg - short and sweet because we only had half an hour,
          and I thought I was doing them a favor by bringing three cabinet members with me since we
          were all up there together for the AGIA signing. I figured the editor would want to
          capitalize on the opportunity to ask them anything - but even that gesture was spun
          negatively.



          Wonder if the conservative Fairbanks delegation causes that editor as much heartburn as I
          do?



          Good thing I love Fairbanks as much as I do - it's almost tempting to shy away from fully
          engaging in communications with the NewsMiner, knowing the editor must not have any
          intention of being fair-but for the sake of the great folks who live there we'll keep at
          it and keep Fairbanks as a centerpoint for so much of our agenda.



          Thanks Merrick!      And I think of you every time I see those amazing pictures.



          Enjoy your gorgeous sunshine up there.



          Sincerely,

          Sarah
