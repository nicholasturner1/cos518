          Just talked with McHugh -




          The National Guard is bringing up a professional film crew for this

          during the first week of September .           They would like the Governor up in

          a Blackhawk talking about the merits of the National Guard . They need 2

          hours for this.

         Here at the Fair I'm reminded that Ak Nat'l Guard needs to tape a PSA

         with me sometime this week or next. Also, Wasilla Assembly of God youth

         group is requesting I speak with their kids. I said I would, or whatever

         their request is for my visit there...
