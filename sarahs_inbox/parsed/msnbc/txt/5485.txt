         Rumors are its in horrible financial shape and was allowed to get to this brink of ruin
         for far too long.




         Our admin inherited this newly revealed problem and we're obligated to clean up the
         problems. I'm anxious to tackle this one with Talis, Joe Balash, Marty, Tom, et al.



         Div of Ag (along with MatMaid) sounds problem-filled also.



         We're up to the challenege.

        Just a heads-up - the rumors are flying through press (Journal of Commerce and Anchorage
        Daily News) about Mat-Maid. Your press office hasn't received calls, but DNR has.
        Nothing's been answered - just passing along to make sure you know what's out there in
        case someone pins you down. Will see what I can get for talking points in case you are
        asked this weekend.




        Thanks,

         Meg
