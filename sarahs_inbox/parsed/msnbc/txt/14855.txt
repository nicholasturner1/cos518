           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,



           Congratulations on the addition of your son Trig to the family!



           We are writing to ask for your support for the funding request being made for Fairbanks
           Counseling and Adoption. Sharon and I are in the process of adoption.    FCA is the only
           agency in the interior to help us thru the decision making process, complete the required
           home studies, and get us prepared for our eventual adoption. Without FCA, we likely would
           not have even started the process.   The staff at FCA are professional and great to work
           with.



          We also volunteer a significant amount of our personal time to support FCA efforts.
          Because of the impact FCA makes in the community, helping is easy.



          Thanks again for your consideration,



          Brian and Sharon Roos

          Fairbanks

                                                                I
