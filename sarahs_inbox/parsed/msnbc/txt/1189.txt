MESSAGE:

Sarah,



We want to congratulate you on the new baby boy. It is great. We were amazed to hear the
circumstances but we know you have gone against Goliath and won. What is having a baby.



We are the parents of Janeen Bailey. We are glad to have Frank in the family.



We have been praying for you since the race began. Keep up the good work.



You are loved,


                                                  1                              ROSTON 02141
