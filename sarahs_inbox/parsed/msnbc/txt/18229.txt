         I did speak to Chuck yesterday on our drive back into town. I discussed the three parts
         that we are working on. These efforts will be coordinated to get the best results and be
         the most efficient.   The first is to get a new BAC named Monday, continue with their
         scheduled meeting and at that meeting they will vote themselves in as the Creamery Board
         and hopefully send names to Irwin for the Ag director position (Franci). The second part
         is to work with cabinet members to come up with new ideas about how our agencies can help
         revitalize the Dairy industry.   The third is Chuck's idea to work with the dairy farmers
         in a working group or task force to get their ideas. The teamsters can be part of this
         working group.



         Between me , Balash and Joe Austerman we will be able to reach out to all these individuals
         quickly and keep things mooving.



         Chuck seemed happy we have a plan but I'm afraid that I did not spend enough time
         soliciting and listening to his ideas.  After touching base with Joey, I will have hime
         circle back and make sure Chuck feels as included and involved as he would like to be.



         Mike

         Yes.



         Things are moving quickly .           Kurt Bruce made a good

         point this morning .      He said most of the retailers

         that handle MM products have known for weeks about the

         coming shutdown and they are already in the midst of

         securing new contracts with others to fill their dairy

         spaces .    He said a press release from you letting

         everyone know that we are on the horizon of a solution

         could stop some of the retailers from signing these

         new contracts.



         I don't think space will be a problem though because

         there will be a lot less product when it becomes 100%

         Alaskan .    Joey will be contacting Kaladi,        Cafe del

         Mundo, New Sagaya , various food marts, etc . to keep

         them abreast of the situation.            This is going to be

         exciting.
