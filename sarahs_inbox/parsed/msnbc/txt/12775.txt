             Yes, the Frontiersman and Juneau Empire have it. ADN probably won't publish because your
             CON op ed was just published two weeks ago. I will do some checking and have an update in
             the a.m.

             Did the Earmarks op ed get sent to Frontiersman and all the other local papers yet? Is the
             ADN going to print it?
