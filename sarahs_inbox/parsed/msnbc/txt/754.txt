Todd,

One of the things they are interested in having you say a few words about is your background and
fishing history. When you started fishing, what kinds of fishing you've done, your family history, etc. I
am working on some talking points for you, but I don't know much about your personal fishing history.
If you want to give me a little bit of information, I can write it up and include it in the talking points I
send you. Or if you'd rather, you can just fill in that part.

They are very excited that you're going to be there.

Thanks,

Cora

Janice and Todd,

I spoke with the coordinators of the reception, and they verified that the event on the 10th is
scheduled to start at 6pm rather than 6:30. They will probably give everyone a few minutes to arrive,
then begin the program at about 6:15. Eric Olson will speak first, then they would like Todd to say a
few words. I will work with Beth and Sharon on talking points.

Thanks,

Cora

I just received a call from Paula Cullenberg with the AK Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program. Paula
indicated that they would like Todd at the Opening Reception, Monday, December 10, 20Q7 @ 6:30
p.m. to give speech and then Cora on Tuesday, December 11, 2007 @ 6:30 p.m. to give speech.
Apparently they are or have sent Cora talking points for Todd. Please let me know if I need to do
anything else for you. Thanks, Janice
