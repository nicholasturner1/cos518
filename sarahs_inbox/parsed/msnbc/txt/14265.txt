           MESSAGE:

           I am sorry to say I did not know much about you until I had heard some comments from Glenn
           Beck on his TV show (lucky because I usually watch Fox). Just would like to congratulate
           you on the birth of your child. Also on the job you are doing in Alaska. I am a 60 year
           old father of two boys, and I worry about what are government has become and where it is
           going with the present class of people that are poised to run it. You are a breath of
           fresh air. I hope John Mcain would have the intelligence to ask you to run with him for
           Vice President. I hope everthing goes well with your new born. By the way my son noah was
           born when I was 52, he is in 3rd grade now and I cannot imaging life with out him. Good
           luck and God Bless. John B
