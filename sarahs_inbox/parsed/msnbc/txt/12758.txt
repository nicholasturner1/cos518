            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

            I was very impressed by your background and accomplishments . I would also like to
            congratulate you and your family on the soon to be new member of your family. I know the
            demands on your life must be great, leadership of a"state and shared leadership of a large
            family. As I said, I was quite impressed after reading and hearing about you as a person
            and as a politician. I know it is right at the time you are having a child, but would you
            consider running with John McCain? I think you and John McCain would make a great match
            for America. I also think you could easily defeat any Democratic ticket. i am sure this
            will only be read by one of your staff members . I still would be interested in an answer
            though. Thank you so much.

            Sincerely,

            Rod Layman
