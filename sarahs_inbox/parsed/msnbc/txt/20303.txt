          Governor - I spoke with the Coast Guard Contact person for this event - Thursday,
          08.14.08.    The event is to last from dinner - 7:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m . at the latest. They
          have an MC that will keep the event on schedule and your remarks would be at approx. 9:30
          or 9:45 p . m.  They will not move you up in the agenda as they are asking for closing
          remarks .   This is a courtesy request if you would like to do otherwise you can just enjoy
          the dinner .   Thanks, Janice
