         Joe's Blackberry is not working, so he has not yet weighed in on this. Kurt and Antony
         have both approved it.

          I hope I struck the proper tone : resolve in the face of desperate threats by the producers
          to kill AGIA ' s must-haves (and not only not apply, but not nominate gas to an AGIA
          licensee in the 0 / S), tempered by the assurance that we just doing what is reasonable and
          fair.  Both full and condensed versions are attached.
