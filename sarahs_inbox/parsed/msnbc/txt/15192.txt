           MESSAGE:

           I would like to congratulate you and your family on your new addition. I was in Tucson
           last week and there was an article in the paper with a picture of you, your husband and
           new baby.  I found the article close to my own heart. My daughter has'a son (who is 7
           months now) born with Down Syndrome. What a joy he has been for all of us! This was her
           4th child, plus she has one step daughter. They range in age from 18 down to 7 months.
           All the children dearly love our Nikolas. We truly are blessed with all of them. I am so
           proud of my daugther for being such a wonderful Mother. My hope and prayer for you and
           your family is to be thankful for what the Lord gives .... and from the article... I believe
           you are.   God Bless!!!



           Sincerely,

           Connie
