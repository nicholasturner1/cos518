              Talis,



              Did that get your attention? Thought so.



              So our thirteen year old daughter, Rachel, saw you on the news the other night. She looked
              over at me with a smile and said, "Daddy, is that the guy who always feeds you butter so
              he can be lieutenant governor?". :)



              Kind of scary when even Rachel knows who my replacement is...ha
