             Read your presser on it, looks great , thank you!



             Wonder where Shelia got that bs info on my "refusal" to host a Foster fundraiser? Let me
             know when you get my email in response to that one.

             Subject: organ donor?




             Governor-




             Alaska has reached a milestone. More than half of Alaska's residents are organ and tissue
             donors. We are the only state to achieve this milestone. I was going to write a quick
             press release thanking donors.  Just checking to see if you are a donor - if so I was
             going to mention it.
