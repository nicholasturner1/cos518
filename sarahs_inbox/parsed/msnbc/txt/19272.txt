             The Senator is "very enthusiastic " about the opportunity to stand with you and talk about
             energy and your solutions to the crisis.

              Here's the "run of the show" at this point:

             Aaron Saunders says that yesterday, the Senator spent 20 minutes outlining his plan and it went
             way too long. They would like for it to be closer to 10 minutes today . The Senator would be
             honored if you stood next to him and then spoke for a couple of minutes before opening it up
             to reporters.

              Your comments, Governor, could mirror that which Kurt and I drafted and I sent earlier and
              attached again above.

             Aaron is emailing be the Senator 's speech so that you are fully aware of what the Senator will
             be saying.

             They believe that just the two standing togther will be news enough and should attract many in
             the press - they would love a press release heading out from our office inviting the press. As
             Aaron said, the Senator could talk about "wallpaper" and the media would show because the
             Governor is there with him.

             He did say that while there have been a few bumps (earmarks, in particular), the Senator thinks
             highly of the Governor, is supportive of the Governor,.and likes what she is doing, especially
             regarding energy, including the debit card plan and now the $1200 energy rebate plan.

             I'll get working on the media advisory right away with Sharon. Governor, please let me know
             what you think of the revised comments. And then I'll begin preparing a press release for
             release just after the press conference.

             Many questions today might be centered around the fact that you are standing together, but I think if
             you stick with "perception versus reality " theme, that would be great. "I've always enjoyed a fine
             relationship with the Senator and it continues to grow stronger . I look forward to continuing to work
             together with him during this time. This state is stronger with the vision and ideas of our leaders
             combined."

             The press conference is in the federal building . Stevens' staffers are inviting media to his office and
             then escorting them to the FAA conference room on the 5th floor.
                                                                                                                                   9
             Aaron wants to remind you that the Senator's plan is not set in stone; he will continue to work on it as
             he gets back to Washington, DC and takes more feedback from Alaskans.

             Thanks,

             Meg

              I'll draft something this morning and get it to the Governor and you. I've put together similar statements previously,
              emphasizing a balanced energy policy that includes the three elements you mentioned as well.

              John:



              Senator Cornyn's office contacted me regarding Governor Palin providing a short written statement on her energy
              policy to post on his website for the virtual Energy Independence Days next week. The purpose of the virtual event
              is to provide a forum to discuss the importance of US energy independence. I thought we could send a short
              statement regarding Governor Palin 's stance on ANWR drilling, OCS, and her gas pipeline plan. All three policy
              positions of Governor Palin conelate with US energy independence by increasing domestic production. The email I
              received is below. Would you like to touch base on putting together a few paragraphs ? Also, what do you know of
              Senator Cornyn?



              Thanks,

             The Senator will be hosting virtual "Energy Independence Days" next week in which we'll have a new splash page,
             buttons/widgets, video of him talking about drilling in the U.S., ect . Newt Gingrich has written a guest post for us and we're
             going to have other electeds discussing the importance of American Energy Independence.

             It would be AMAZING to get a simple 2-3 paragraph guest post by the Governor , a podcast, or a video that we could use to
             help us get the message out. She is obviously one of the most effective people in this regard and adding her name to our
             initiative, even in the form of a guest post would be awesome.

             If we need to write something up and have them sign off, or whatever it is, it would be awesome.

             We're also going to be doing a blogger conference call, if she was interested in being on that we could work our schedule
             around her.
