            Walt - thank you for your reply. No need to lease an aircraft in the month of May,
            however. Pls tell John Glass that's not necessary although it sounds like the King Air is
            unavailable again that entire month for another mandatory 200 hr inspection, we'll be out
            of Juneau by then as the session will be over. I'll be working out of the Anchorage office
            in May and will schedule events that allow me to drive to them, and the few locations I'll
            need to fly to I'll take commercial.



            So again make sure you guys don' t lease aircraft be my office will be headquartered in
            Anchorage that month.



            Also, for it to be down again for painting? How much $$$, how necessary is that?



            Thanks.



            Gary- re: Security' s request to replace Tom's vehicle in Juneau : instead of purchasing a
            replacement vehicle in Juneau, pls have him take over Fred ' s rig that is now available
            and/or drive the explorer that's in the House garage . That ought to save about $30g.
            Thanks

           What day would that be that I'd try to fly commercial from Juneau to Anchorage then on to
           Fairbanks for next weekend ' s events?

            And again- I have no idea what the issues continue to be with the availability (and
            $500,000 in recent repairs later ) of the King Air, but it ' s sure a perplexing situation to
            realize that I never get to count on using that state transportation . I still don't want
            to believe the rumors/speculation that they' re trying to teach me a lesson for selling the
            jet, but it kinda makes some sense when you consider the unreliability of my
            transportation that I encounter most any time I'm expected to be at events that aren't on
            the road system where I can just drive myself.



            I hope Alaskans understand why we ' re not able to show up to as many events as previous
            Gov's may have been able to attend that require King Air transportation .     Maybe touch base
            with Walt on this ? At least ask him "who ' s in charge " when it comes to availability and
            maintanence of the state plane.

            Even specifically in this case of the King Air being unavailable for my use again now for
            how many weeks? If this is going continue to be par for the course , we need to just shift
            gears away from ever expecting the aircraft would be available for my reliance on its use.
            I'll continue then to rely on my own driving. to events on the road system and not
            accepting as many events that require flights , thus lessening burden on Security and DPS.
            It seems this is another good reason to capitalize on pending retirements , less Security
            needs, budget constraints, etc., and we can really pare down travel and security costs
            (and other burdens on DPS). That's my direction.



            The biggest frustration is always having so many scheduling issues "up in the air" (which
            isn't fair to schedulers nor to Alaskans doing the inviting) and having to guess whether
            I'll be able to rely on air transportation to get me to pending events and appts.



           I'm most comfortable , secure , and have more - convenience when I'm able to rely on my own
           transportation arrangements ( specifically road trips ) and not reliant on speculating
           whether I ' ll be able to use state transportation or commercial.



           I don't want anyone to have hard feelings over this or point fingers , but it's obvious
           that travel and scheduling proceedures can and should become more sensible , reliable and
           less costly when we get answers on why it's so difficult to count on state air
           transportation, and we accept that security and travel processes can be pared down from
           today forward-in order to simplify and process travel more economically .  Thanks

            I talked with security and DPS has two mechanics working on it right now. They hope to
            have it fixed by the weekend/first of next week. Once it is fixed they then have to test
            fly.  We should not count on it for Fairbanks - this would have to be commercial flight.
