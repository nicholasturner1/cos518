         Governor/Sharon, if you need more information, please let me know.



        Also, if the Administration feels the need at any point, I could put a letter together to
        the White House, our Senators, or the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
        However, in honesty, I don't think that this would accomplish much given what is already
        occurring.

         Sharon- sounds like this is the issue that the reporter from Monocal Magazine was asking
         about yesterday. I didn't know the context of the issue he was raising about "...our
         concern (or lack of) about the arctic territorial issues...". Maybe he'd spoken to critics
         at VOT before our interview?

         Subject: Voice of the Times /Today's Column on Territorial Claims in the

         Arctic




         In today's column entitled, "Alaska has a role to play in staking a North Pole Claim," the
         voice of the times states:

         As far as we know, neither the governor nor anyone else in her administration even took
         note of what was going on - first with Canada jumping into the fray, and staking its claim
         to the same territory the Russians deem to be theirs, and shortly thereafter with Denmark
         getting into the act.

         With this in mind, I just wanted you to know that the Governor's DC office follows the
         territorial issue very closely.  The predicate for the assertion by the US of territorial
         claims in the Arctic is Senate ratification of the Convention on the Law of the Sea,
         together with appropriate research. The Convention establishes the framework for the
         assertion of claims by individua 1 countries before the United Nations.



        In the past, the State has supported Senate ratification of the Treaty.  So does a
        majority of the Senate. However, ratification has been blocked by a few Senators who are
        concerned that the Convention will lead to the loss of US sovereignty. Quite the opposite
        is true.



        The word is that the Senate, with strong support from the Bush administration, will
        consider the Convention in the fall. Both of Alaska's Senators have previously supported
        the Convention.  In addition, the Bush administration has taken steps to acquire the
        information necessary to assert a territorial claim.




        A quick call from someone at the Voice of the Times would have elicited the response that
        the Palin administration is very much aware of the current situation. Given the
        parliamentary situation in the Senate and the position of the Bush administration and
        Alaska's Senato rs, there is little more for us to do at this time.
                                                       2



                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0004215
