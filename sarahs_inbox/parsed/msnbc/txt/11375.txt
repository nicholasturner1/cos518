              Yeah- the point with my frustration was that 1 ) Privil would have Prlvileg forward it to a group
              of people ( many I do not know ), and 2 ) that someone rom that group would immediately leak
              it to the ADN.



             Annette believes she can find the sender - hopefully tomorrow.

             Ok, now it ' s my turn to say I'm sorry . I just saw the whole ADN blog on that letter from
             Mike . I didn't realize when you and I were corresponding earlier that it also contained
             your email in the trail beneath his . That should NEVER have happened. OUCH!
