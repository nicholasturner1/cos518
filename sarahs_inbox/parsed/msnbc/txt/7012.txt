         i just called ed rasmussen Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




        you're right Ivy -      Privileged or P




       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




        anyway - he's leaving fish bd. in December, I told him I'd start looking for replacement -
        he said HE'D look for replacement.




        said he's doing something with a Health Care group be our group's mission is "too big",
        though he didn't let me explain what our group was going to try to accomplish.




        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                      ... mostly wanted to talk about
        sport fish needs, as I'd anticipated.        wants to talk further with Denby about his issues,
                                                            2
