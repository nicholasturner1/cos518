                Hi Molly -

                As discussed if you would please pass this email on to Heather and Karina. The Governor has been invited to the
                Alaska Regional Hospital Volunteer Appreciation Luncheon on Wednesday, 04.30.08. This will be held at the
                Sheraton Hotel on the top floor in Josephine's starting at 12:00 p.m. The Governor will be reading a Proclamation
                and has invited you all to join her in lunch.

                They have asked for a confirmation of attendees as they will have name tags made and also I need to let them
                know of everyone's pick of entree'.

                Top Sirloin or Mango Salmon
