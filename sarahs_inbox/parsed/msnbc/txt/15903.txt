            Marty- the six weeks of mid-June through July are the most valuable days in AK for travel
            to communities I haven't been able to access through winter months - and I may actually
            see the King Air available for a bit of my travel in July (DPS is promising I'll get my
            turn to use it at least a few times soon! I hope...) - so I need to know how important it
            actually is to spend some of those days in Canada. I'd rather spend the time working in AK
            communities during these coming weeks, unless you believe an Ottawa visit is very
            important at this time.
