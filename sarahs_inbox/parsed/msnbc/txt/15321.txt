                   Subject: Heads Up on energy Plan

               Just wanted to let you know , Rep Doogan called today as a courtesy to the Governor to let her know that he does
               not support the energy plan. He doesn't want to surprise her when he makes public comments.

               His reasons are: 1 ) this isn 't a policy 2) too broad , should go to those who really need the assistance 3 ) too
               much of a hand-out

               In addition , he said he thought it may have been helpful to the Administration to get feed back from some law
               makers prior to its unveiling.

               It is best to know now what some of the concerns and criticisms will be before the legislation is introduced.
