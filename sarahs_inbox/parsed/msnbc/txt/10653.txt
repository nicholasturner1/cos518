              MESSAGE:

              Dear Governor Palin;




              As a registered Republican in a Democrat state (why me, Lord?), I have to thank you for
              being a young, attractive person - of EITHER gender!

              Yeah, Maryland has a relatively handsome Governor in Martin O'Malley. So WHAT? He's also a
              Tax & Spend DemCong LibTard! His nickname around here has become Martin O'Money, because
              he's never met a tax he didn't like!

              Huzzah for Alaska! A good-looking Governor with something between her ears besides a high-
              quality vacuum!

              Congratulations! Keep up the good work, and when are you moving to 1600 Pennsylvania
              Avenue, D.C.?




              Jim Kratzer




              PS: DON'T tell Martin about me; I'm a State Employee!

                                                                   1
