              Subject : CSPAN and Life-A-Thon
              CSPAN is interested in having you as a guest this Sunday at 7:30 a.m. It would be a half
              hour show hosted by Peter Slen. It is an interview and call in show. Likely topics will
              include energy issues, your open, ethical and transparent administration (they have read up
              on you), the national political arena, and U.S. Senator Stevens. This program will be on
              during the time you have an opportunity to go to a church service. Please let me know if
              you are interested.

              Also, Karen Lewis (local) with the Life-A-Thon is hoping for a few minutes of your time for a
              taped message. KATV and KAFC, the Christian stations are going to air the Life-A-Thon
              over a two week period. They would tape an interview or even a quick message if you like.
              Others who have contributed are Wayne Anthony Ross and Loren Lehman. Again, if you are
              interested, let me know.

              Thanks!
