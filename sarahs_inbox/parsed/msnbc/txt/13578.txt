             Larry - do you want an Anchorage-based administative job? Or Juneau? I love working with
             you, let me know what I can do to help whether you choose inside or outside this political
             arena! And congratulations on taking a bold step to open new doors. That's always good.
             Please don't hesitate to tell me what you ideally want to do, as long as I can do you more
             good than harm I will support, and advocate for, your next adventure.

             Change is good. Thanks for keeping me in the loop. Make sure Allison knows (though it
             sounds like she's moving to another state) that she -just like Larry - would be welcome to
             continue serving Alaska in other capacities/areas.



            Thanks John!

            Larry Persily has indicated his intention to return permanently to = Alaska sometime this
            summer.  He is not enamored with the public = policy process in DC, particularly what
            Congress does and doesn't do, and = wants to involve himself directly in Alaska life.

            He asked me to emphasize that his decision is not related to the = Palin administration or
            this office . Larry has been an invaluable = member of the DC staff and is a good friend
            and colleague of everyone = here.

            Change is always difficult , but I respect the decision of the = staffers leaving here to
            pursue their personal priorities .  I believe = that our new people are capable to doing
            the same excellent work as = did their predecessors.



            I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on the course of = action outlined here. I
            have copied Larry on this email so that he = can add any comments of his own.




            Please note that my email address has = changed . My new email address = is
