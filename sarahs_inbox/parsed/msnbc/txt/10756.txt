               I haven't read it yet, but I will soon. I'm happy to hear he continues to convey the right
               msg-all the good things going on in ak. his last article about you was in newsweek this
               morning.

                Just getting back to jnu. It's cold here, too! Have fun in petersville!

               Nice article about Leol Man, that Steve Quinn sure is able to capture a ton of
               information and present it so well for the public's understanding. It seems he does have a
               great sense of where we're going, relays that, but sticks with the facts in doing so! How
               refreshing...



               Hope you're feeling well and rested.



               We're snowmaching in Petersville tomorrow for Track's last ride before he returns to
               Georgia, so can't make Benson's shin dig... I apologize for that be I know you guys are
               going to have a blast!
