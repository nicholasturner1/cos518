            I was in his office about something else when this came thru and had to keep from smiling.
            so neat to see another supporter placed.

           The attached letter is from chairman Kelsey recommending Ted Leonard for the Executive
           Director position.  I will have a response letter prepared and sent first thing in the
           morning accepting their recommendation ( assuming that' s the case).
