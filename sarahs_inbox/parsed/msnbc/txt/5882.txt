              Importance: High

           Please know that the Governor has committed April 19 to be in Glennallen giving a speech at 11:00am to high
           school students ; at 2:00pm meeting with Elders ; and 4- ? having dinner with the Elders , children, and
           community of Glennallen and surrounding villages (there is a large basketball tourney taking place and lots of
           visitors will be in Glennallen for the week, thus the invite to the Governor). It would be very hard to cancel this
           event.....

           Who from our administration is planning on going to the Elkins ' service, does anyone know?

           For consideration - trip to Ketchikan to attend memorial services for former-Rep. Jim Elkins

           April 19th - Ketchikan
           5:00 - 9: 00 PM @ The Landing

           Both Kyle Johansen and Bert Stedman are almost certain to attend.

           Jim Elkins was a strong supporter of Governor Palin, and was a beloved figure in Ketchikan politics.

           If more information is required... please let me know.
