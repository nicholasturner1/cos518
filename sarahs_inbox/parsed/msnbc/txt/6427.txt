         Subject:                  Letter to Editor:(


         Walt- is it true the troopers have a cadillac escalade in its fleet, as is reported in
         jennifer clark's letter to the ADN editor today? if not true, pls respnd to her letter
         with a follow up letter to be published in ADN (asap, please!) And if it's true -why in
         the world would AST have an escalade? If it was confiscated property, your letter can
         clarify.



         Hopefully our Communications people are scanning for these types of public complaintants
         against us so I can quit loosing sleep over the need to scan media to catch things like
         this. Hopefully you were already informed of this complaint and your folks were
         responding, publicly, to it?



         Thanks! Sharon and/or Kris can help get a response out, too.
