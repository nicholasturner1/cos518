              President's Weekly
              April 28, 2008
              Now that the 2008 Legislative Session is over we turn our
              attention to the upcoming 2009 Session and the elections
              preceding it. Although several of our bills did not pass in 2008
              we made significant progress toward our ultimate goals of
              repealing Tier IV, Military buy-back; and Presumptive Liability.
              Rest assured that these fights are far from over - we will
              continue the pressure until we prevail. We have scheduled a PR
              planning meeting for May 22nd during which we will frame our
              long-term PR and political strategy for better funding, work
              conditions and compensation packages statewide. There is a real
              disconnect between the Governor and public safety and I believe
              that she doesn't know that she doesn 't know - I think it is
              called unconsciously incompetent . As we partner with AFSCME
              personnel and resources and create structure and consistency to
              our approach I encourage all to be ready and willing to

             It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the
             DPS budget and contract results... especially in light of how hard you

              needed to do their job. Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have
              been overlooked by some.
                There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union",
              and this is unfair to you, to the whole administration, and most
              importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth. Please share
              your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on your
              work product and our committment to public safety can be countered
              with the truth. Thank you
