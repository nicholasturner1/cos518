            Hi Sarah-

            My mom said you all were talking about comfortable dress shoes and she was trying to
            remember the ones I wear at work. They're kind of expensive, but worth it. They are by
            Cole Haan and there is a whole line of Nike Air dress shoes. I've found them at Nordstrom
            or you can order them online at www.colehaan.com Good Luck! Tiffany
