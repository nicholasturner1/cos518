            Dear Governor,



            Although I'm from Massachusetts and a supporter of Mitt Romney, after reading about you, I
            believe you would be the best candidate for Vice President. I know McCain has not asked
            anyone yet, but please do your best to put yourself in that position.



            Thank you, a fan of yours,



            Gary
