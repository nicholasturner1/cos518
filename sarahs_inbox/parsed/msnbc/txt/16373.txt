              Excellent. Thanks, I'll cross my fingers on that one.

              The US Supreme Court is expected to issue its Second Amendment decision today. I know
              this is of interest to you, as well as to me and many other Alaskans.




              The decision should be issued around 6:00 am, your time. I'll do what I did yesterday
              with the Exxon Valdez opinion so that you and our press people are in a position to
              respond quickly if you so choose.
