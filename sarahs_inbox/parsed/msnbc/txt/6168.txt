               Subject: Kenai Superior Court

             Attached is information on the 4 Kenai Superior Court nominations. Several endorsements have been coming in
             and are noted in here. Interviews are scheduled for next Tuesday, July 17th at 2:00 pm. The deadline for
             appointment is Saturday, August 1st.

             Kris, when you have a minute would you mind printing a copy of this for Governor Palin? I don 't think she'll be
             able to open this from her blackberry. Thank you!

             I've provided Mike Tibbles a copy of the nomination packet and an endorsement list. Please let me know if you
             have any questions.
             Thanks,

             Ivy Frye
