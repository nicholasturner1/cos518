          Governor,

          A good possibility for a small processor is Jack Schultheis of Kwikpak Fisheries .  This is
          the company on the lower Yukon that Eric Olson works for . I'm still waiting for his
          resume, but I expect to have it soon . I know he has previous ASMI board experience and
          Kwikpak has a good reputation for quality.

          You asked if we could find someone for the large processor seat who is an Alaskan
          resident . I did some research and did not find any large processors with an Alaska
          resident CEO.  Given this , Tom McLaughlin at Seafood Producer ' s Cooperative is probably
          still our best candidate .  He lives in Bellingham.

         FYI, Icicle announced today that they are selling the company to a private equity firm in
         California, Fox Paine Management . No management changes are expected.

          Cora

         Thanks! Yikes - that was embarassing and now I hate to have to put my name on those race
         registration forms.



         Also - what did we come up with for small processor to fill on the board ? Cora was going to
         look . Also , the replacement for Giles on the board - where did we go there?
