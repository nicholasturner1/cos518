            I think part of this also relates to us not being able to talk to the public until we
            made our findings and decision about TC.

            I can't understand why some press people have to have a negative side to everything. Gads
            we will win in spite of that.



            I don't think the legis opposition helped themselves the last two days with very limited
            consultant knowledge . We need to do a good the next few days. We certainly have
            prepared . God bless.  Tom

            Dittman's association with AOGA could explain his poll numbers showing majority support
            for Denali- see below:

            Amazing how Mike Ross has a doom n gloom teaser line before an article on the legislative
            consultants' hearing that I thought was pretty positive.



            Also on the next segment they failed to disclaim that Ditt is on AOGA's Board of Directors
            hence the 42%-31% preference in his poll favoring-the producer's project.
