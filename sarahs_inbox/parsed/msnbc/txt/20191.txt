           Good morning Governor - the House Finance version now has the Resource

           Rebate at $ 1,200 and the Senate passed $500 .           They will take up both

           versions in House finance this morning - we continue to push for the

           resource rebate at the higher number .         We also continue to testify that

           the intent is to get this into Alaskans hands as soon as possible. I

           think some progress is being made , but it is slow going! Karen

           House needs to bump the rebate way above the Senate ' s version. And I

           need assurance Revenue can get the checks out attached to PFDs early...

           fuel barges take orders earlier than the October PFD disbursement. The

           public does not know that our intention is to get surplus $ into

          Alaskans ' hands before October. Pis let leggies and the public know

           that.
