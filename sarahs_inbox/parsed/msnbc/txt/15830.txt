          MESSAGE:

          Dear Ms. Palin,




          I was very impressed with your boldness and willingness to fight for America's right to
          use her own resources. It's refreshing-much like we have heard about Governor Joe of New
          Mexico, I believe, who reformed local prisons and got prisoners to work to earn their
          keep. Felons incarcerated for years should work and contribute.



          Although you said you wouldn't consider being VP with McCain, I would vote for that
          ticket! You'd be an asset to the ticket.. .keep up the good work, let's use some of our
          oil, shale, and natural gas resources and stop worrying so much about being so politically
          'correct' and 'tolerant'.




         Virginia Wischet




                                                               1
