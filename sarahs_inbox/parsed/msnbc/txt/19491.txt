          Importance:              High


          I would like to know what happen to the."All Alaskan Pipeline"? I am tired of the

          high cost of fuel in Fairbanks and Anchorage pays cheaper for fuel than Fairbanks.

          All three of you need to go to http://www.fairbanksgas.com/ and find out what the

          problem is and find a solution to it. I have already petitioned the federal

          congressional delegation about stopping oil speculation buying crude oil that is

          driving crude oil price up.




          I want a gasline that will benefit all Alaskans not just a few communities. I

          believe this proposal only benefits Anchorage and not Fairbanks or the State of

          Alaska. There needs to be more proposal submit before jumping on the first one that

          comes around.



          Thank you
