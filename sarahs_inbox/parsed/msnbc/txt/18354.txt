        Yes.  My fault for the last minute changes but the first run seemed to miss the relevance
        for most Alaskans.

       Is there anyway i can get these things the day before, or earlier? My commute into
       Anchorage won't allow me to open the attachment and read them while I'm driving.

        Work Ready/College Ready

       August 27, 2007

        Governor Sarah Palin




       Thank you so much for coming this morning.



       Today we are announcing the State of Alaska's Work Ready/College Ready

       program ... and it truly is an exciting announcement.




       All too often, when we hear discussion about our education system and

       our kid's ability to succeed in the workplace, we hear two common

       messages.     One,'that we need to do more and two, that the government

       needs to spend more. While I agree that our education system must have

       the resources to be successful, we also must be innovative about how we

       spend our education dollars.



       We have all heard the bad news... that our dropout rate is too high and

       that too many kids that do graduate high school lack the necessary

       skills needed to enter many jobs, colleges or other types of training.



       Creating new job opportunities for our young Alaskans and preparing our

       kids for those opportunities is a top priority of this administration.

       In an unprecedented manner, our department of education and our

      department of Labor and Workforce Development have joined efforts to

      examine how we can increase graduation rates, attendance rates, and job

      placement rates.



                                                       2




                                                                                                   PRA_GSP01_0004195

        A real focus has been placed on examining how students can learn

        academics in a work context and apply their skills in a work situation.

        Through the efforts of Commissioner Click Bishop and former Commissioner

        Roger Sampson, the State of Alaska will be implementing a system that

        will identify gaps between student skills and employment needs. Our

        Ready/College Ready program will help align our curricula to meet the

        job skills employers need and not only help our students see the

        connection between school and work but actually document a student's

        readiness for work.       Something the private sector, all employers and

       parents can get excited about.




       Our program is based upon assessing and improving three basic skill

       areas - applied math, reading for information, and locating information

       -- that are critical to transitioning from high school to the workplace,

       college or occupational training. It also empowers students and

       job-seekers by letting them know what level of skills they need to enter

       the fields they are interested in.




       I can't stress enough how imperative it is to have a trained workforce.

       With the prospect of a natural gas pipeline coming online in the next

       decade - we NEED to be prepared. We also need to do everything we can

       to make sure Alaskans have opportunities to stay here and seek good,

       high-paying jobs.       I know none of us like to see jobs going to folks

       outside.




       I am happy to have Roger Sampson return today for this announcement and

       I will now turn it over to him to further explain the program.




                                                         3
