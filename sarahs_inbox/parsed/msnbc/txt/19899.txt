          Marty : I'd like cabinet members to be down there to support AGIA team , touch base with
          leggies, etc this week- we can turn the visit into a cabinet meeting luncheon. Does
          Thursday sound good ? Or before that?

          J- I forgot - it's wedding day, don't turn that bb on and don ' t answer emails! :) give
          Hannah and Jake a hug from the Palins today!

             Mike - let's plan cabinet mtg in the form of a luncheon at the house this week, if we
          can assume enough members can be in Juneau. It's a historic week if the AGIA vote is
          taken , so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that ( and in support of AGIA team). We
          can do a bit of an informal lunch w/roundtable setting and we'll literally go around the
          tables getting updates from everyone of their dept activities.

             Rosanne: can you do this - Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:
             No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with the video Andy and Jason
             took great effort to make , where I'm saying "rah rab" in support of the participants... and my husband took TWO
             DAYS of his slammed schedule to judge the pageant even! !! He left commercial fishing early to keep his
             committment to judge the thing!!! (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so
             no, I didn't make it in person, I was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to fairbanks to meet with seven
             members of the US Congress on ANWR, but... Sheeeesh- can folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of
             support" on something. Argggggh!
               You know, I think I'll do my own letter of correction on this one.
