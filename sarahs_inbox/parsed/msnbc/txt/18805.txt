            Maggie Price emailed us this morning saying that she would have to back out of the running for the Permanent
            Fund board. Her note is below.

            Frank Bailey
            Director, Boards and Commissions
            Office of Governor Sarah Palin

            Dear Dan,
            I did hear from the compliance department this morning and they would only approve the appointment to the
            position if I abstained from every investment decision. That would render me pretty useless as a Trustee/Board
            Member. Given that, I regretfully request that you pull my name from any list of candidates that is currently being
            put forward to Governor Palin. It has been an honor to even be considered, and it may be something I
            could/would pursue in my retirement. Best of luck in filling this very important position.

            Thank you,
            Maggie Price
