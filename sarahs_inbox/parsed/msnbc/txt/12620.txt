               Rosemary Shinohara of the ADN just left me a voice mail asking for certain
               information about our earmarks. She was not there when I returned her call.

               I will provide the information she wants. But, it also occurred to me that she might
               benefit from the perspectives contained in the Governor's proposed op-ed piece to
               the Fairbanks News-Miner. I said in my return message that I could provide the
               specific information she wanted but that she should contact you to see if there was
               something more we could provide.


              Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
              jwkatz@alaskadc.org. Thank you.
