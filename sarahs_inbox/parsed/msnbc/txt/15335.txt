           I agree with ADF & G on hunter safety... those shooting ranges throughout the budget that
           aren't State owned could still get a portion of State support, so pls plug those back in
           but reduce the amounts. It would be for existing ranges/gun clubs, not to acquire land for
           a new one. Thanks!
