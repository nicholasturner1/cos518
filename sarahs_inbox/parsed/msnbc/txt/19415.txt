              Governor

              Here is a status update from yesterday on the resource rebate bill, HB 4002.

              Resource Rebate

                       House C & RA Schedule

              This bill was schedule and brought up very briefly in House C & RA. Co-Chair Fairclough set out the
              following hearing schedule:
                       -   July 15 @ 8:00 am in Juneau (1 hour to hear from just myself and Jerry Burnett from
                           Revenue)
                       -   July 17 @ 4:00 pm in Anchorage (Public testimony)
                       -   July 22 @ 2:00 pm in Juneau (Testimony by invitation only)
                       -   July 23 @ 10:00 am in Juneau (Public testimony)

                       Senate Finance Schedule

              The Senate Finance committee is hearing 4 bills on July 15 @ 9:00 am, including the Senate version of
              the resource rebate bill. This means we will have to present quickly at House C & RA and run upstairs.
              (Kelly, can we check with Miles on Monday and see if he will move talk to Bert about moving this meeting
              to 9:30 am? If they won't we will need to have someone else on prepared and on standby in Senate
              Finance to present the resource rebate bill if I am still stuck in House C & RA Who would you suggest?)

                       Substantive Issues

              Other than setting the schedule, Rep. Fairclough mentioned some legal issues that had been brought to
              her attention by Rep. Lindsey Holmes. The two issues were:
                  (1) the Federal constitutional issue with residency periods for need -based welfare programs. (Which
                       is not what our resource rebate payment is); and
                  (2) whether the bill causes legal problems or issues with the permanent fund? (Which we believe it
                       does not since none of the funding comes from the Permanent Fund and we are setting up an
                       entirely different program)

              Rep. Fairclough asked us to have LAW ready to answer these questions at the hearing on July 22. I told

                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 2


              her we had already looked at the issues, but would be prepared to answer them at the next hearing . My sense is
              democrats like Rep . Holmes and Rep. Gara want to change our bill to a needs based program . One way to try
              and get leverage to do that is to poke at the structure of our bill and try to get leverage to amend it into a needs
              based program. (Changing to a needs based program also happens to benefit a lot of their constituents) After
              we answer this set of legal questions , these same folks will probably come up with some more . Their goal is to try
              to find something that sticks or at least raises enough doubt that they gain votes for an amendment to a needs
              based program. We can't prevent them from raising issues , but we will answer them.

              I am working with Chris Poag, Mike Barnhill , and Mike Ford on the legal issues. We have a meeting to review
              everything again this Tuesday. We will be ready to answer the questions on the record for Rep. Fairclough.

                      Next Steps

              Since the LAW attorneys are usually off for the weekend , I am reviewing the research and the issues Rep.
              Fairclough asked about I am also finishing up my opening statement On Monday , I would also like to start
              meeting with the individual members of the committee to review the bill and answer questions , and try to count
              votes. ( Kelly, can your office set up the meetings and would you like to come with me ?) I am leaving the
              organization of any public testimony on the bills up to the Legislative Office. My plan is to keep preparing , present
              the best case possible to the committee , meet with them, answer questions , and try to count votes , and then do
              the same thing at Finance, the House Floor, etc.

                      Comments from Legislators

              One legislator mentioned to me yesterday that Rep. Chenault prefers just tacking the amount of the
              resource rebate payment and motor fuel tax savings to everyone's permanent fund and issuing one
              check. Rep. Meyer was quoted in the ADN as saying:

              "Kevin Meyer, an Anchorage Republican who serves as co-chairman on the House Finance Committee,
              said short- term needs must be addressed while various alternative statewide energy projects get under
              way. "The rebate, I look at it as a Band-Aid, and I think we need to do that now because that 's something
              that can get to people fairly quickly," Meyer said. "I think the rebate, plus taking off 8 cents , are all things
              that we can do now," he said . "It will help bridge the gap until we can get some of these other things
              done."

              The negative comments being relayed to me are coming in from Senate Leadership , particularly Senator
              Hoffman . Also, it is clear neither Speaker Harris or the Senate leadership are going to make the bill
              process easy. Referrals to lower committees , having chairs drag out hearings over two weeks, and
              scheduling hearings on top of each other are not helpful.

              Governor Hickel & Malcolm,
              It is with extreme disappointment that I send this email . I am speaking about the BackBone III flyer you just sent to
              all 60 Alaska Legislators. And I know many other people share my indignation and disgust.

              It is totally inappropriate to imply that good government doesn't allow for differing opinions. And it is totally wrong
              to imply that the Palin Administration isn't working around the clock to protect the State of Alaska, and every
              individual Alaskans' interests.

              We are a state that has amazing potential , with many options available to us. To suggest that choosing a gasline
              option that differs from your vision is somehow corrupt is so wrong. And it ignores the reality - which is that we

              can do both projects! The AGIA project will allow an LNG option to proceed if there is market interest in doing so. Nothing
              in AGIA limits the LNG interests.

              It is beyond imagination and good taste that you have chosen to use individuals names as supporting your position without
              first getting their permission , or who are regretfully not alive to have participated in the AGIA discussion.

              Most of all, I am totally and irrevocably disgusted in the insinuation that Marty Rutherford or the Gasline Team has anything
              but the highest standards in achieving what this state needs, which is a fair , open and transparent process . In fact you have
              previously commended them for looking out for Alaska 's interests. Now I can only that your definition of looking out for
              Alaska's interests only means doing what you think is best.

              Finally, I believe a public apology to Marty Rutherford and the Gasline Team is appropriate . They are the best people we
              could have representing this state.

              This a sad day,
              Tom Irwin
