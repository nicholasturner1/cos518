           Erika! Heads up that there will probably be a lunch on Friday at the Mansion for Mr. and Mrs. Ivan, who lost their
           daughter due to violent crime, and the Governor is signing a bill Friday as a result her death. Sharon is working
           on an invite list and will run it by you and the Governor. Thanks.
