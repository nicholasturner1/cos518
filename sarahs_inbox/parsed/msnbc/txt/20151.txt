           he's working straight out of the sp playbook. His new ad talks about "new energy" for
           america

          Subject: Obama




          He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole out Energy Rebate
          $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking points, etc. So.... we need to take
          advantage of this a write a statement saying he's right on. (Glad he's flipflopping on
          OCS, too.)

          Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction" to some of Obama's
          good points this morning?
