              thanks for answering him Talis. We didn't have anything to do with former Govs signing on
              to any amicus.

             Dear Mr. Tkacz,

                         The former Governor's joined the Legislature Amicus Brief, not

             the Dept. of Law Amicus. The Dept. of Law did not coordinate which

             Governor's were or were not contacted to join that brief. I think the

             attorney's who drafted that brief for the Legislature could answer your

             question.       They are James E. Fosler and Jared A. Goldstein.



                         The confusion may have come from the press release where Governor

             Palin did thank the former Governor's for their expression of support in

             the Legislature's brief which seeks the same remedy as our brief.



                      Hope that helps.



                         Talis Colberg

              Mr. Attorney General,



                    Would you please confirm for me that former Gov. Murkowski was given

              the opportunity to add his support to the state ' s amicus brief on the

              Exxon Valdez hearing before the US Supreme Court.



              Sincerely,
