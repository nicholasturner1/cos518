        Subject:                   Matmaid response



        "I know the governor's office has a limited roll in the MatMaid issue as there are many
        levels of burac. between the corporation and the governor, including the Crem Bd, the BAC,
        the Division of Ag, and DNR... But when the governor's office is asked to step in and help
        MatMaid then I need to be able to access all information. ..."



        Something like that, explaining that we've asked for information so we could help - they
        haven't provided it. And now I hear VanTreek's exit parachute is pretty golden? The public
        just wants to know that we can make wise decisions - we can if we're given all info we
        need on the phase out (or revitalization) of this enterprise.
