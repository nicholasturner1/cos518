              It was, very minor- I call it a fender bender, don't know what the insurance company calls it... and
              I'm not sore, it wasn't that impacting even. I immediately went into the office after being rear-
              ended.
              Crap- how'd Zaki hear about it?
              And I think it was Glenn and MtView (?) the intersection by Northway Mall.

              Governor-

              I just heard about the accident. I hope you are okay. I did get a call from Dennis Zaki with
              Alaskareport.com asking for details . I'm sure more media outlets will find out.
              May I share-

              You were rear ended at Glenn and Bragaw intersection.
              You are sore but suffered no major injuries
              You were alone In the vehicle

              Curtis evidently participated in a couple of different venues the past couple of days - evidently
              his efforts were both overt and covert. If true, it will make working with Enstar pretty darn
              difficult and tough to answer the question: why aren't we just doing this ourselves? (As I've been
              asked a few times today.)

              Governor,
              I spoke with Colleen Starring (Enstars Regional Vice President) and she assured me that:
              1) Enstar is committed to the South to North project and they have been in discussions with Doyon on this strategy
              for some time. This is consistent with what they have said to us; and
              2) She was leaving that moment to go see Curtis Thayer to tell him to "keep his mouth shut". She promised me he
              will not be saying anything further. And she apologized for him. From the discussion with her I had the distinct
              impression that she was surprised and very irritated that he'd participated in a call-in show.
              Marty

              If lobbyists Curtis Thayer and/or Ashely Reed did ANYTHING to deceive us or the public- they will be sorry. I
              heard enough "questions" today to believe we may not have been told the whole truth about Enstar's plan to work
              cooperatively w/us and ANGDA. Not good. We need to get to the bottom of it. .

              I have called Scott, left a message and asked him to call. The message to him : Curtis is not the decision maker! There
              could be a lot of this, especially from the few talk shows and the naysayers against everything . We all need to rise above it
              and get a pipeline. He needs to control his messages and messengers . We will control ours. Don't rise to the bait. Some
              want us to fail. Alaskans want this to succeed. Scott has worked hard for this . We can and will sort out the issues as we
              advance the partnership.

              Tom's calling Marty, who is going to call Heyworth.

              I didn't hear Thayer's comments on KFQD but apparently they sent the ANGDA folks over the edge.
