               kari - fyi interview for record/schedule. also - security just called me on their way to pick
               me up for flight to skagway - now the problem is the King Air has a flat tire so can't fly
               afterall. My family is all on the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the niceities without me
               this evening in Skagway and I'll still try to get there somehow tomorrow. what a
               continued zoo this is, trying to get from point A to point B - and i don't know why the
               flat tire wasn't discovered until a just now.

               erika and ivy - I may be here afterall tonight.

               got it - did it - thanks! i like Joy - she keeps it short and sweet.

               headed for the airplane for skagway. it's miserably wet and windy... i miss SouthCentral
               on days like this especially!

               thanks for the skagway info... I'm printing it off now.

                Ch. 2, Joy Mapaye, was wondering if you could call her for a quick interview.
                End of the session is here, how are things and with the arrests - is that too big of
                a distraction as the session ends? Her number is 762-9260. Please let me know if
                possible - I could also look for Irwin. Interview should either happen before 4:30
                or after 6:00.

                Thanks.
