           There may be parts of the bill that are supported, but I can't imagine"HESs testified in
           favor.

            DHSS supported Sen French's SB 160 on the record.   This bill mandates universal health
           care coverage and includes government provision of coverage.




            I haven't seen the committee substitute, and I have no idea why we support the bill,
           which. passed a committee today.

                                                                 1
