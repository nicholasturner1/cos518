          Thanks Joe.

          I figured as much. I'm passing on what was said here at the Tribal Health Mega Mtg.



          Sen. Stevens urged the Governor to call a special session in the fall to address the
          health care crisis triggered by high energy.


    {
          Just wanted the Gov to know this in case she gets asked-



          I can't imagine how exhausted the team in Juneau must be.



          Thanks for fighting the good fight.          The sense I get here is that the Governor's efforts
          are appreciated.



         Rhonda

         Legislators do NOT appear to be willing to entertain another special session regardless of
         the subject.   The hope is that the house and Senate can come to some agreement in the next
         32 hours. . .or there won't be any relief.



         For what it's worth, there was an appropriation for schools energy costs included in the
         FY09 budget.

          Am here at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Mega Meeting.




           Senator Stevens made a surprise visit.




           Julie Kitka made a request at this afternoon's energy roundtable.



           Would like you to add energy relief for health care systems and schools to the special
          session -- or call a special session this fall.



           Tara Jollie and I are here.



           Anything you want us to say?



           Thanks.
