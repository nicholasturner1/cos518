        Governor Palin,



        I followed up with Mark yesterday. He feels he's most suited for Juvenile Justice or
        Human Rights Commissions.



        There are expired terms on Juvenile Justice and a vacancy on Human Rights Commission
        (Chris Hayes resigned).  I talked to LaDonna about Human Rights Commission, and she didn't
        seem too excited about it. She said she would do it, but was more interested in
        land/hunting issues, specifically unit 13.
                                                                   1



                                                                                                             PRA GSPO1_0002291
