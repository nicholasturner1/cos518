             Yes, Governor, Sharon called him and pointed out the inaccuracies in his radio show before
             this op-ed appeared.

             Subject: Fagan



             Had anyone called him to correct his lies about the Statehood book? I thought it was
             accurately and truthfully explained to him that our office did NOT contribute to the book,
             that I did not have anything to do with it and had never even known any advertising
             company was even writing it- I have never even read it!

             He disparaged so many in this op-ed- and put the nail in his coffin in terms of
             credibility, in my opinion.

                 If he was told the truth about this issue when it cropped up on his show all week (as
             I was told it's been his topic for a couple of days), and yet he still printed lies this
             morning, then this is more than the usual case of "Fagan ignoring the facts" - this is
             another case of Fagan outright lying. We will call him on this, and we need to let his
             boss at ADN know that they allowed another lying op-ed of his that has totally discredited
             their publication.

                So, however we can deal with this- we shall            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                                                                               in my opinion, this is
             another one that went too far because if he was corrected with the truth before he wrote
             this, yet wrote it anyway, I would think there would be outrage by folks who want to make
             sure we're dealing in truth.
