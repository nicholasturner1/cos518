MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin and Family,



You are a bright light in.the dark regions of the political landscape of our great country. I try to pray
for you everytime I see your name. Primarily I pray for wisdom for you in your decision making.
Beyond that I pray that God will give you strength to manage the extremely heavy load you are
carrying; humility to continue to be "the people's governor"; grace to face those that oppose you;
faithfulness in taking care of your primary responsibilities -- wife and mother; and over all -- God's
Blessings.



I have wanted to write a quick note of encouragement for quite some time now and couldn't help but
take the time after reading the notes to Trig. We had a "surprise baby" this year for our fourtieth
birthdays. What a scary (starting over), but joyful (many prayers answered) addition to our family of
one teenage daughter.



                                                      1                            ROSTON 02627
