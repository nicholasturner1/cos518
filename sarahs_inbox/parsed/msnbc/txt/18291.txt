             Dear Mr. and Ms. Schmiedt:

             Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging response
             to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.

             I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
             under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.

             I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget
             goals to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.

             I appreciate hearing from you!

                                                  Sincerely,

                                                  Sarah Palin
                                                  Governor

            We would like to say THANK YOU to Gov. Palin for her line item
            veto action! ! It's about time someone took action against the
            irresponsible spending of our legislators! ! It is absolutely infuriating
            that they spend our hard-earned tax dollars on things that have
            nothing to do with the needs of the state. KEEP UP THE GOOD
            WORK!!
            God Bless You!
            Sincerely,
            Gordon and Marcia Schmiedt
