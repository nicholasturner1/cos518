               Dermot:




               Loved your column last week re: ACES mission to allow more info to/from companies, and
               to/from state departments.



               I've been plagiarizing (not really - I'm giving you full credit) as we engage in these
               ACES town hall meetings with my reading of your column.



               I don't think Alaskans were aware that state law was the enabler in this lack of
               communication problem between DNR and DOR. Thanks for doing a better job of pointing that
               out than we've been able to do.



               Sincerely,

              Sarah Palin
