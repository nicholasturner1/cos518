        ExxonMobil told House Resources that despite some legislative improvements to House Bill
        177 (the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, or "AGIA"), the bill overall still doesn't provide
        sufficient flexibility for prospective license applicants to put forward meaningful
        proposals. Rather than prescribing specific requirements, the state should lay out general
        goals in the bill and allow applicants flexibility in addressing them.




        Martin Massey, company spokesman, praised changes that tighten criteria for selection of a
        licensee, allow producers to oppose rolled-in tariffs on pipeline expansions and make the
        $500 million state grant a bid option rather than a requirement.




        Senate Judiciary, meanwhile, focused on issues of judicial review and appeal rights of
        unsuccessful applicants for the gas pipeline license envisioned by AGIA. Appeals could
        delay final award of a license. The Senate's version of AGIA is SB 104.




                                                      4




                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0001091

         Under terms of the current Senate version of the bill, the legislature must pass a
         resolution approving the administration's award of a license.




        Committee members offered differing views. Sen. Bill Wielechowski said consideration of a
        bill, rather than a resolution, would reduce appeal options for an unsuccessful licensee.
        Sen. Lesil McGuire endorsed use of a resolution. Sen. Gene Therriault said the Legislature
        should set out requirements in the bill and leave licensing to the administration as part
        of its normal executive branch duties.




        At a Judiciary hearing Thursday on SB 104, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance testified
        that upstream fiscal issues need to be resolved before North Slope producers will make
        commitments for space in a gas pipeline. "The Alaska Gasline Inducement Act puts too much
        emphasis on mitigating the short-term financial risks incurred by pipeline builders and
        does too little to address the much longer-term risks of gas shippers," the Alliance said.
        "For the sake of Alaska's future, the Alliance urges you not only to determine what terms
        aren't constitutional, but also to find a mutually beneficial solution that is."
