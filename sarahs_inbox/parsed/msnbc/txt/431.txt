I'll surely get this on the schedule, but is the Haines Fair, or another Fair up North? May I have the
names of the organizers? Thanks!

Dear Governor Palin, On Thursday, August 23 from 4:00 pm to 6:30 pm

there will be the annual fair reception which traditionally was the

"Governor's Day Reception". The Alaska State Fair would very much like

to revive the tradition. In fact, in addition to the formal reception,

they would be interested in declaring a "Governor Day". Is this

something you can schedule for August 23? Please let me know and I can

tell them to plan accordingly. Thank-you Talis
