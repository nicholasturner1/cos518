        Sarah,rnThis stinks, I originally recieved a tier 2 permit for caribou, then after
        spending hundreds of dollars going up there to scout an area to hunt and surveying the
        caribou, I come home to find out that my permit has gone to someone else. It seems like
        the old &quot;squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; philosophy. The problem is that I don't
        know who to squeak to. You are the only person I know in state government. If you can't do
        anything about this, or direct me to someone who can... please feel free to use my example
        in any fight the State may have in this matter. rnrnV/RrnBruce Eggleston
