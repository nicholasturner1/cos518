             Anna doesn ' t feel comfortable telling you - but she has a strong feeling it came from
                                      Anna stressed she has no proof , it's just her gut talking.

             Yes- some supposedly gave a head ' s up (not reporters) and Prov ramped up to pre-empt.

              You mentioned it to Steve Quinn and Sean Cockerham the morning of the SOS. Are you hearing
              that Providence knew even before that?

              Got word that Prov was told before my SoS the line re: eliminate CON. How did they know
              this?
