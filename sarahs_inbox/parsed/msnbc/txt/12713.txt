            MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin,

            First of all Congratulations on your pregnancy!



           Next , I would like to ask that you consider the needs in the South Goldenview area. The
           area has grown alot and the congestion around the School , the intersection at Rabbit Creek
           and Goldenview is the only exit from the hillside above Goldenview Dr. The Fire Department
           has to go down Rabbit Creek Rd. to Goldenview Dr., then up one of the other roads to get
           to a fire . Alot of precious time is wasted . If there were a need to evacuate the upper
           hillside , they would have to battle alot of traffic . If the Mountian Aire extension was
           put in, they would have a straight shot right to the upper neighborhoods.



           Thank you for your consideration on these projects.

           Sincerely

           Cheri Ford
