             Subject : budget
             It was good to get out of Juneau for a day, as I encountered quite a few people who wanted to
             give suggestions on the budget - everyone I talked to is pretty outraged at the size of the thing.
             Lots of examples were given where cuts could/should possibly be made.

            From the $10million (federal project) rocket launch facility, to Railbelt Energy Funds, $350,000
            South High's Booster Club request, dust control in Nenana, relection ponds and Fairbanks Dog
            Park - lots more examples. People who have dug a little into it and can not believe what
            legislators did with pet projects and with requests for funding projects on the heels of promises
            of no more state funds to sustain some of these existing projects. And on the heels of campaigns
            that promised recognition of government's proper role.

            Reporters are asking about some of the obvious ones , including ADN pointing out Manly airport
            relocate for a couple million ... which I hear would be used to accomodate some who want to fly
            in but just don't want to drive through the community . (It's an example of something obvious that
            we need to look at and ask : it's it an absolute necessity THIS year? Can it wait/be phased in? Is it
            EVEN necessary?)

            Karen - it will be great to see recommendations from your staff re: projects that obviously have
            to go - projects that legislators perhaps had asked for in the past and didn't get - signifying the
            project isn't necessary but were plopped in in hopes of a new administration having mercy on
            their project(s). With a sensible and conservative look, please have them recommend soon the
            line items that can wait, or can just be eliminated.

            This will be a lot of work, I'm sure, but we'll set a precedent in this first year that we're serious
            about reigning in government growth by cutting that budget. Thank you.
