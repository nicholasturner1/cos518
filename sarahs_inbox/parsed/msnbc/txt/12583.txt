                      Representative Cissna,
                      I urge you to support the State of Alaska appropriating funds to match the $2 million
                      Anchorage Pool Repair Bond. Pools promote safety and health and enhance the well being
                      of the community.

                      . Pools save lives and provide a variety of aquatics activities for all age groups and skill
                        levels 12 months a year.
                            o Alaska's drowning rate for ages 0-14 was almost 2.5 times the national average for
                               1981-2002. ( Alaska Health & Social Services)
                            o Swimming and life saving skills are taught & learned in pools.
                            o Pools provide year round recreational opportunities for all ages. For winter in
                               Alaska - that's BIG!

                      . Repair costs of the 5 Anchorage pools totals $4 million. Proposition 4 authorizes bonds
                        equal to the amount appropriated by the state to a maximum of $2 million - a one to one
                        match.

                      . For a $300,000 home, the annual expense will be $4.29 - less than a deluxe coffee or a fast
                        food meal. Base cost is $1.43 per $100,000 of home' s assessed value.

                      Thank you for your time and support.

                      Joe & Amy Klein - Anchorage

                 Mike,

                 In follow-up to the Governor's meeting with Premier Fentie, see email below. They were
                 pleased. I'm working with Shelley on a summary of the meeting and will email you tomorrow.
                 Also, as I mentioned on the phone Friday, they had some concerns regarding the Porcupine and
                 Chisana cabibou herds and suggested working together on a herd management strategy. I
                 provided that info to Commissioner Lloyd and Doug Larsen.

                          Shelley and Patricia,
                          I just wanted to thank you again for your hospitality on Friday. I know how much work it is to host
                          these things; your efforts are very much appreciated. Everything was perfect: the airport pick-up;
                          the number of participants you were able to line up for the meeting; having the Accord there
                          ready to sign; your cooperation on the news release; the lunch (in particular, those Alaskan
                          potato chips and the cookies were a big hits). Premier Fentie was very pleased with how things
                          went.

                          It was great that you were able to have a photographer at the meeting . Would it be possible to
                          receive copies of the pictures?

                          Best regards,
