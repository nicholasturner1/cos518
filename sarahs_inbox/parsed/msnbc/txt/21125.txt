         MESSAGE:

         Hello Governor,rnAs a Director of one of the regional Small Business Development Centers
          (SBDC) in Fairbanks, I am concerned that the State wide leadership at SBDC is losing many
         of their best professionals due to a lack of quality management. The State wide SBDC
         offices fall under UAA Business College Department and are now under the direct leadership
         of a leader who has (in my opinion) communications skills that seem more confrontational
         than nurturing. I believe the SBDC's are crucial to the economic development within our
         state but the focus now seems on getting donations versus economic development. Please
         look into the management of the SBDC for Alaska and I ask that you please don't publish my
         name because I am concerned of reprisals.rnThank you,rnJames C. McDermott, M.S.rnBusiness
