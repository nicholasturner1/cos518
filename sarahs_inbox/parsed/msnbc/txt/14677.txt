           MESSAGE:

           I have read most everything there is on you and your accomplishments. I like that you are
           a part of NRA, Pro Life and against same sex marriages yet in favor of some benefits for
           them.

           I'm a farm boy from Nebraska and am looking, during each election, for people with
           integrity.  I now live in Oklahoma, widowered and retiring 74 years old.

           Please, please, please, call McCain and tell him you want to be his running mate. In the
           future, if I live long enough, I will be the first vote for you for president. I tell you
           what, you don't think the rest of the world would take notice. WOW!!!!!
