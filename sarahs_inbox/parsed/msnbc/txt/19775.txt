           Dear Gov. Palin,




           I am an ex-alaskan,soon to be reborn back into the greastest state in the union. I have
           read the current situation with the wooten/monigan much ado about nothing and wanted to
           let you know that your actions are exceptional and above reproach! I am only sorry that I
           was not in Alaska to vote for you during your bid for the governorship.




           I have followed your career with some interest and find myself cheering for you on all of
           your decisions.




                                                                1

            I am 62 years old and have few heroes in my life, you are the top of the heap above JFK
            and very few others. I realize that you will most probably never see this e-mail but wish
            you and your family all the best in health,wealth and happiness.




            I only hope you can withstand the beaurcrtic nonsense that you are facing on a dailey
            occurrance and put those wanta-be importantant legislative bums in place.




           Thank you for being here when Alaska needs a hero!




            (P.S.) Do a late showing and pass up Obama and Mccain for the presidentcy.

                     The Coming Assault on Small Businesses
                     By Tom Donohue, President and CEO

                                          You can't say today's union leaders don't appreciate irony. Last week one of the nation 's largest
                                          unions held a global rally protesting our system of free enterprise and capital investment . The union
                                          called it the "Take Back Our Economy" rally. Well, if it manages to push through its radical agenda,
                                          what it will do is "rake Down Our Economy."

                                         In fact, the agenda of a handful of national unions represents a direct assault on America 's small
                                         businesses. Their top priority is passage of the deceptively name Employee Free Choice Act,
                     commonly referred to as "card check ." The bill would make it cost effective for unions to go after Main Street businesses
                     and small retail establishments.

                                                                                                                                          >> Join the conversation.

                                     Donohue Outlines Union Agenda and Chamber's Efforts to Block It
                                     The Chamber is fighting a big union agenda thafs "bad for business , bad for workers , and bad for the
                                     country," Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue said during a July 21 speech unveiling the
                                     Chamber's Workforce Freedom Initiative , a comprehensive grassroots and education program to defeat
                                     labor's anti-growth and anti-competitiveness agenda.

                                     U.S. Chamber leaders held a July 21 event in Everett, Washington, to highlight the economic and
                                     competitive benefits of free and fair trade and a strong transportation infrastructure.




                                     Chamber Calls for Balanced Approach on ADA Changes
                                     The administration should consider the costs and burdens of its proposed accessibility requirements on
                                     business owners before it makes changes to the Americans with Disability Ad (ADA), according to U.S.
                                     Chamber Vice President of Labor, Immigration and Employee Benefits Randy Johnson.
