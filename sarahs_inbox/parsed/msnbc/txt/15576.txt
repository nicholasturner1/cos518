            Governor,




             Will do. I know you're speaking at 8:30 - when are you planning on arriving at the forum?
            I want to make sure I get these to you in plenty of time to put your notes in order.



             Kate

             Governor,



             Sounds like today was, well, a challenge. I and others let you down, and I apologize.
            Just got off the phone with Meg, we were trying to come up with a methodology to ensure
            you are not left unprepared again. An interesting (and maddening) dynamic, with too many
            cooks in the kitchen, but they're all in the backyard when you need one. We can fix that.



             If it is any consolation, it went great in Kenai -- rave support for our process and TC
            Alaska at a jam-packed Chamber and on KSRM. I think the others experienced similar
            results elsewhere at to big events.



             Two points:



             First, as to your Forbes interview on Thursday, Meg and I will ensure your have notes in
            hand tomorrow, as well as an assistant to be with you during the interview. Is there
            somebody specific you request? We can turn whoever you need loose from the Forum. I
            strongly recommend Marty.




             Second, re your Forum speech tomorrow, Meg said that Kris had passed along that you are
            not interested in "reading another book." I agree. You've been there done that re the
            minutiae of the findings. I would suggest something very simple, basically just an
            introduction, along these lines:
