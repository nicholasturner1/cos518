              Does the state or First Family need to present them with anything? Resolution or
              Proclamation or any individual award or retirement or long-time anniversary notation of
              any teacher/principal?

             Ugh- guilt trip on NEA meeting. Yes, I'll go do their Saturday event, a quicky, hopefully.
             But we'll have to find a legitimate Piper/Willow reason to travel Friday night - Sunday
             from Juneau to Anchorage. Is this possible?
