            MESSAGE:

            Gov. Palin I live in New York and I am very jealous that you are not our governor. I have
            followed a lot of your moves and I Fell you are doing a great job. You have a lot of great
            policies and seem to run the state of Alaska very well. I feel you are someone that would
            help reorganize this country. Other governors should look at you as an example.
