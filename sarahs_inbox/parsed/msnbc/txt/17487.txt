       The only n/s flights jno/anc are early a.m. and late p.m. I think COS Tibbles wants to
       talk to you about Begich event before we proceed with changing your flight. Also Todd
       called about this weekend, there is nothing on the schedule after the Mother/Daughter Tea
       on Saturday--he said you might head to an event in Glennallen and come home Sunday night
       with Bristol instead... the troops are waiting to see if we need to change that flight as
       it fills up fast anc/jno Sunday night! I hope you are enjoying Arizona, it's raining
       here.  Kari.
