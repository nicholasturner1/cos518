          Tomorrow at APA conference I am going to speak on AGIA progress, ACES, and rural energy
          costs.



          On rural energy costs, Ikm pointing out that we have to think and act cooperatively. I
          say that we don't equate an energy plan with random, uncoordinated appropriations fr state
          government. We are paying much more attn to benefits versus costs.



          I also talk about your Railbelt Energy Fund veto and reiterate your message about long
          range collective planning of energy projects serving the entire Railbelt.



         I also discuss conservation and energy efficiency as low hanging fruit for all to shoot
         for... and, provide a bit of a discussion on renewables and alternative energy--though i
         make it clear we don't support massive spending in these areas.



         Let me know if you can think of any landmines . Thank you.
