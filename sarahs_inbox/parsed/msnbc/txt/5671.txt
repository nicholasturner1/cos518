              let me have marty and torn respond with our talking points.
              thanks for doing this!

              and they can let John Katz know of your plans also.

               Governor,

               Since I'll be in DC next week at the National Lt. Gov. Association
               conference, we had called Drue Pearce to ask for a meeting. Drue responded
               and mentioned pulling together a lot of people from different agencies.
               Although I expected just a friendly individual meeting with Drue, I'm happy
               to take the opportunity with the larger group to walk through AGIA. Is this
               a group that you or other members of the gasline team met with while you
               were back there? Is there anything in particular I should be aware of?

               And, can I get your DC messaging material, assuming it hasn't changed?

               Sean

               Make sure Sean feels comfortable with presenting the AGIA to the federal
               interagency MOU signatories - which include senior staff, mostly appointed,
               from each of 16 agencies . He'll be the "draw" and I expect lots of
               interest.
               We can set up for a power point or whatever he wants to use.
