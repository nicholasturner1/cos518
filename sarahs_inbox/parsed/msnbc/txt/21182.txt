          Thanks K. Our fits are all messed up be of weather. Our bags are on the plane it sounds
          like, but we're not. So, hopefully we still get to fly out tonight but i'll probably miss
          the game if we even do make it in tonight. :(

         Governor -



         Hope your NY adventure went well and you're travels home are uneventful.



         FYI, I'll be at the Aces game tonight and will have my cell Privileged 0 so feel free to
                                                                                I,
         call if you make it to the game and can't find me in the crowd ( which appears to be a big
         one!).



         Also, at tomorrow's leadership team meeting we will break for lunch from 1 - 1:30 so
         invite you to join us for lunch as you get to meet the crew. There will be about 17 of us
         there - deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners (one who will retire in Jan.),
         division directors, and special assistants.



         I'm also looking forward to sitting down with you in the near future to brief you on H&SS
         issues.



         Thanks for all your hard work on behalf of Alaskans!


                                                                  1
