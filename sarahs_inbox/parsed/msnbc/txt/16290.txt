           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin, keep up the good work, along with your strong ethics and
           determination.  You are making American people like me proud to hear about your story. I
           hope you have a higher calling. We need good, honest "people", who are willing to serve.
           God Bless you and your family.
