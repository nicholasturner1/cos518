             MESSAGE:

             So is our Governor Palin really considering to go on the presidential ticket?

             I'm not to sure that'll be a very good idea , i think Alaska isan't ready for too quick of
             a change in leadership from palin to parnell. alaska is still recovering from the drastic
             cuts and direction from its previous Governor. i think in leadership positions it is
             better to finish a job before taking on a new one unless that person can put in an eqeal
             amount of time into both.
