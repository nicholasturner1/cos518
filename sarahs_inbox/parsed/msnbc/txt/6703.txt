             Governor,
             We will not hold back with Halcro - and we are all looking forward to this opportunity!

             Also, did you want me to participate in the Monday meeting with Halford? Whatever you wish
             is fine with me. Finally, where would you like the Halford meeting to occur? If desired, I could
             set it up at the airport.
