 My recommendation is that we invite the ancsa folks, TC, and state gas team members. My rough
count is 22 ppl. We could do it tonight at 5:30 or 6:00

 Tonight's great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and still be
successful. There's a Costco in Juneau, if you know what I mean. And my family is quite capable of
setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

 Great idea! Please all decide what is best for AGIA. But if time doesn't matter tonight is better for
me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision. Again decide what is best for
AGIA. Tom

  Cool! We should cook it for whomever needs to have that get-together/reception opportunity
tonight, tomorrow, or wednesday. I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good opportunity to have folks
over for informal gasline chat.
