             Governor,



             I'm planning to stay in Anchorage Monday/Tuesday rather than coming to

             Juneau as I learned there's a Ft. Rich memorial service for nine

             fallen soldiers. I think either you or should be there and since

             you're in DC, I'll cover. Just thought you should know we'll have

             coverage.



             Sean
