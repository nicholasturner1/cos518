         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor,

              No doubt someone else reads this e-mail for you, but I just want to say I'm proud to
         live under your governorship.  As one who takes little interest in politics, I recognize,
         oddly but seriously, that "you're a regular person". You do your job while living as
         normal a Life as the rest of us. Congratula-tions on the birth of your son. Keep up the
         good work.  Warmly,      Lyn Barela
