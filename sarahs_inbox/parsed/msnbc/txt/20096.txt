             Some of these questions have to go through Talis and Barnhill.

             Sharon- don't answer until I hear back from Nizich, Barnhill, et al. Hopefully they gave you
             some talking points already today. Thanks
             And I don't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it, so please pass this
             email on to him before Sharon returns ADN's call. Thanks

             Governor-

             The Daily News wants to know if we have anything to say about Branchflower . Do you want me to
             say anything new or repeat that you are open to answer any questions?
