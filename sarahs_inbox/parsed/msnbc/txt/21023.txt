              Nah - no questions - just a Thank You.



              Janice- pls note I'm now leaving the DMV meeting, and the Alaska MidWives Convention that
              also happened to be held at the Marriott - I invited myself and they were very cool.

          Governor,




          Do you want to open it up for questions at the Council stop tomorrow? Or just `thank you
          for your work on these important issues ' and shake some hands ? Eric Olson said they'll go
          whichever way you like.



           I'll have some points for you in a thank-you if you choose to use them.                    Privileged or Personal II
