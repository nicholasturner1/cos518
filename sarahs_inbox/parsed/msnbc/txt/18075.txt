        Governor,

        You had mentioned an interest in releasing some fbx appts before heading up to the agia
        signing. I have the draft written for some fbx b&c appts and also for mike macdonald that
        I'll send to meg and sharon today incase you guys decide to anounce them before you head.

        north.

        Thanks,

        Ivy
