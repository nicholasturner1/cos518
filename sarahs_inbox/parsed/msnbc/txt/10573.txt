               What a grump he is.



               All the more reason to applaud you for your patience with him. Too bad he can see that
               we're all on the same team.

               I don't want to protract our current dialogue with Mr. Hamel, but I = feel obligated to
               forward his personal response to you (attached). I = haven't given him your email
               address.



               Below, is my recent advice to DNR and the Alaska Fire Marshall about = how to handle the
               current situation:


             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              The responses I have received seem to confirm this approach.
