           I googled and found a Dittman poll for Murk in August 2006 referenced on Kyle's
           blog.

           Dave Dittman , the longtime Anchorage pollster who worked on Murkowski's campaign
           earlier in the race , finished a poll on the Republican primary last night.

           He says he surveyed people who are eligible to vote on the Republican ballot and
           voted in the party's primary in 2004. (Except for a fraction - 7 percent - who have
           registered since 2004 and say they'll vote Aug. 22).

           Dittman says he didn't conduct the poll for any particular candidate and that the
           sample size is about 500 people. His results are similar to the recent Rasmussen
           Reports numbers:

           Palin: 40 percent
           Binkley: 29 percent
           Murkowski: 17 percent

           Dittman writes: "Fourteen percent (14%) are still undecided with a week remaining
           before the election, however a demographic analysis of the undecided voters
           estimates that if the election were held today, Palin would receive 46%, Binkley
           34% and Murkowski 20%.
