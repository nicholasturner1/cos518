  Tara,

  It was likely Russ Kelly . The letter has been finalized and was scheduled to go out on Friday.

  I'll talk w/you Wednesday when you get back.

  Hope all is well in DCCED!

 Subject : andy baker letter

 Kris/Todd,

 When I got back from Bethel last Friday I had a phone message from someone (a man) in the Gov's
 Juneau office asking about the letter I drafted for Andy. I returned the call and left a message about 4:45
 and didn't hear back from him. I am leaving tonight for Nome and St. Michael's and will not have cell
 service until I return on Wednesday morning.

 Kris, you are the only other person I know of that has an electronic copy of that letter if they need it before
 Wednesday.

 Their message realiv didn't say much more than they were following up with this letter and I think their
 direct line is Rec'^uW: I will follow up on Wednesday.
