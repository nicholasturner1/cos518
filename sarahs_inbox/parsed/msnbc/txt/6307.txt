         FYI: Michigan is 4 hours ahead of Alaska. So the meeting at 4pm MI time will be 12noon
         Alaska time rather than lpm.

        Subject : Williams Meeting confirmed




        Janice,

        I just received confirmation that the Williams group will fly to meet Governor Palin
        tomorrow ( Friday , July20th) at 4:00 pm Michigan time ( 1:00pm Alaska time ). I am having
        our office confirm a meeting room at the Grand Traverse Resort and Spa, along with
        teleconference capacity .   Once I have the meeting room and phone number information I will
        convey it to all of you, as well as to Williams.

        Thanks everyone,

        Marty
