           Russ - what did Meyer say on this ? I haven't tried calling him again based on you speaking
           to him- but I will attempt again if he still isn't budging . Others who also want the bill
           heard must start speaking up, asap, including publicly bringing it to light that Meyer is
           sitting on it.

           were you able to ask Rep Meyer to get the bill scheduled ? Just want to confirm either
           way.  I am hearing from legislators that Meyer will not schedule the bill.
