                Subject :   Fairbanks energy costs




               Remembered another comment from today as I heard a lot of ideas from residents about how
             to provide relief for high energy costs ( I am not particularly endorsing any of
             these ... just passing along citizen comments.)

                 Here's what I heard:

                1. Why can ' t the state do something with the Healy clean coal plant to provide cheaper
             power ( Steve and Tom know those issues better than I)

                                                                  4




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0016283

               2. Why can 't the state suspend the oil tax for a time on in-state producer refined
            gasoline in exchange for producer agreeing to drop price of gasoline.



                3. Raise local property tax exemption to 100000 instead of just 20K.



                4. State should fund Susitna Hydro



                while these were observations from others , one point was driven home for me,..             Privileged oi^

             sure, feel free to pass to Tom , Steve...
