                 Juneau, Alaska 99811 - 0020

                 Dear Director Rehfeld,

                 Please find attached our November 21, 2007 funding request to the Honorable
                 Governor Sara Palin. We have been encouraged to resubmit our second funding
                 request to you at this time.

                 As stated in our November letter, the 2.5 million dollar request was contingent
                 upon receipt of federal funding. The amount of our federal earmark was originally
                 $916,000. The adjusted amount is now $641,000 and is, at present, being
                 challenged. We have every indication that we will receive this funding, and as such,
                 we are reducing our state funding request accordingly, to 1.9 million dollars.

                Chris Rainwater, AACD President, and other members of AACD would like to meet
                with Governor Palin and Commissioner Tom Irwin to discuss in detail the funding
                request and the proposals in our November 21st letter. This meeting is very
                important to us and we can be available to meet with Governor Palin and her staff
                in Anchorage, Wasilla, Juneau or any place she designates, from February 18th
                thru March 26th. Please contact our Executive Director, Eric Wade at 357-4563
                Ext 110 in our Wasilla Office, or myself at bvehrs@gci.net, 907-892-8258/907-
