              Subject:                Cancellation of 10:00 a .m. deployment today!


              Governor - I just spoke with McHugh Pierre. The deployment that we had on your schedule
              for 10:00 a.m. today happened yesterday morning.  There was no ceremony - it was just a
              handful that deployed for 45 days. Apparently it was continuation of group that went out
              Sunday evening (Lt. Gov) attended that one. Sorry for any inconvenience. Janice
