            I will be in the Juneau office sometime around 2:30 this afternoon. Is there any chance we could
            do it this afternoon?

            The Governor is agreeable to a bill signing with the finance co-chairs today, but out in the sun! I told her we don't'
            have Andy and Jason so she wonders if we could get Channel 2 news or someone? Please advise!

            Good morning , y'all.

            I always like to make my favorite OMB director happy.

            One way to do that is to have my favorite Governor sign SB 82 , the Governor's must-have, time-sensitive oil and
            gas supplemental bill, as soon as possible.

            Shannon is poised to run the bill down to the Governor at the drop of a hat.

            We don't need trumpets , whoopla, and whatnot to mark the occasion. A simple bill-signing in her office will do,
            followed by a press release.

            For good measure , I suppose we could ask the finance co-chairs to be there. I defer to greater minds than mine to
            address this.

            Kari: how does the Governor 's schedule look today for a bill-signing?

            Chris
