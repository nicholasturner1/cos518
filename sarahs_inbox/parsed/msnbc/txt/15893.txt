            MESSAGE:

            Hello,




           I just recently read an article on you. To be honest I had never heard about you till
           then, I live in Oklahoma, so all you heard about is this state. You sound like a real
           stand up person, faith in God: honest, loyal, morals, I pray this is true. I am not the
           kind of person that w^rites letters or sends emails, but something told me to write you,
           maybe it is because I am worried about this country and the up coming elections. The
           article I read, said you would be a good choice for V.P. running mate for McCain. I am
           really not a McCain fan, and I am NOT an Obama fan. In this country I believe the
           Presidency is bought, who has the most money, backed by big companies. I wished we had
           more people like you running for President and running this country, you would have my
           vote.




           God Bless,



           Eric Guyton Sr.
