  Todd - In the email that I just sent, I do not have Willow returning back to Anchorage as I need to know
  what date/time you'd like reservations for her. I believe we were talking about Thursday a.m., but I want
  to check before having the arrangements made. Also, would the Governor like to come back earlier on
  Friday, 08.03 @ 1:30 p.m. - 3:16 p.m. or the later flight out of Juneau - 6:37 p.m. - 8:17 p.m.
  Anchorage. Thanks, Janice
