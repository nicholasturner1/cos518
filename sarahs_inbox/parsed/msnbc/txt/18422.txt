         This is probably the sixth msg today that Ive already received from supporters who have
         heard some want to stick with ppt - these messages are a major "heads up" that anything
         embracing ppt status quo is not going to be acceptable by those who's team i am on in
         terms of doing oil taxes RIGHT this time. This morning's been hectic already with these
         msgs and reminders that murkowski's people are still influencing ppt internal debate

         Frank,



         Sorry, know you're busy but I just forwarded a letter to you from Hickel to the Governor.
         If you could print it out for her. He also indicated it was faxed to the office if you
         can't. I was curious what prompted it so I called him and he said they are hearing from
         legislators that the administration may stay w/PPT and that the Governor is being
         influenced by the bureacracy that crafted this under murkowski. I told him I was in
         Seattle and that I'd ask you to follow-up w/him on this (wanting to speak w/Governor on
         this).



         Thanks!



         Kris
