                I did not hear about Tony . We generally are not informed about University personnel changes . Also, we talked
                about Andree on the phone but if you have other questions, let me know.

                Did you know Tony was let go?

                Also, let me know what's up with Andree MacLeod before she starts calling my home phone.

                 Hi, my name is Cathy Glaser and I am a 37-year 4-H Leader and President of the 4-H Volunteer Leader's
                 Assn . for the Mat-Su/Copper River Dist. I am writing to you about my concerns/ideas to save the 4-H
                 program and its most important arm-Cooperative Extension Service in Alaska.

                 Recently , our CES Director, Tony Nakazawa, was terminated by UAF. He had just presented a
                 comprehensive strategic plan to 'update' the 4-H program to make it contemporary .' I read the 26-page
                 plan and found it well researched and written . He had a plan to finance the CES program, so the
                 University/state would not have to pull the full load. I have heard that Dr. Jones , from UAF wants to
                 make CES into a research vs. service/educational.

                 Having been involved in the 4 -H program for 47 years , I can tell you that it is and has been a very
                 important part of me and my family-5 children went through the 4-H family . 4-H has most of all, made all
                 of them better citizens to contribute all they can to the United States . They worked for and earned many
                 national trips, made many new friends , had fantastic experiences , and especially gained knowledge from
                 the 4-H Program. Today , the 4-H program has changed with the times , and offers many new and
                 exciting projects.

                 I have through the years , been very impressed with the CES personnel in both Wyoming and Alaska.
                 Both of these states value the work that CES people provide, both for the everyday life issues and the
                 agriculture issues that concern our states . I do not believe that 4-H could function without CES in the
                 state of Alaska . I do not want Alaska to be the only state that does not have the CES Program,
                 especially with a land-grant university.

                 I feel that CES should have their own line-item in the annual budget of the University . That way, the
                 personal vendetta from certain officials at UAF , would not be able to completely cut CES and in turn, 4-H.

                 I am appealing to your sense of fairness and compassion , to help us save the CES and 4 -H Program in
                 the State of Alaska . Thank you for your time.
