              Evidently their expectation of my scheduled time was different that what I saw here on the
              schedule - intead of 15 min it was about and hour and a half ... Hopefully they're not
              offended but I was told I'd give an intro then could hustle off to my next appt . Thanks
              for finishing the mtg with me. Have janice ached that follow up mtg Sherry is requesting.
              Thanks ( either Anchorage or Juneau whatever works for them)

             For sched : the ANCSA mtg wasn't a 15-min call in... They had questions of my until I
             finally had to cut them off (hope they ' re not offended ) at 10:20.

             Pls note on sched . And hopefully this didn't put me too far behind on getting intro ready
             for next speech!
