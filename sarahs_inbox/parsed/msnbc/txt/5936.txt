         I called the members friday evening. I thanked them for their service, but let them know
         the administration was taking the board in a new direction inlightof the current
         situation. The only question I was asked was if he needed to attend the tues mtg. I said
         no.

         Subject: MM replacements



         I assume Mr Willard is a former BAC member? He was on the news tonight, saying I shocked
         him when I made an abrupt call to him to dismiss him this weekend. Hmmmmm. I've never
         spoken to him - whomever called him - what was his reaction to the explanation I'm sure he
         was given when explaining the bd was to be replaced?
