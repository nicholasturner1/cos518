                From the updated information, I believe the only good news from this is that the 12 year old IS the survivor at this
                time.

                (Note additional Pilot details at the bottom of the original message).
                On 4/16/08 at approximately 0750 hours AST Helo 1 located the helicopter crash site at
                N 61.50.292 and W 147.22.611 and found one survivor and 4 deceased.
                Helo I transported two US Military PJs to the crash site to stabilize the survivor who is reportedly suffering from at
                least extreme hypothermia.
                Helo 1 transported one PJ and the survivor to Mat-Su Regional Hospital arriving at 0900 hours.
                The survivor is tentatively identified as: Quinn Ellington.
                The State Medical Examiner has given permission for removal of the deceased from the scene.
                They will be transported to the Palmer Airport and transferred to Valley Funeral Home, pending further instruction
                from the SME.
                The NTSB has been notified and is expected to travel back to the crash site with Helo 1 on the return flight from
                Palmer.

                Synopsis: On 4/15/08 at approximately 1625 hours the Rescue Coordination Center reported to AST
                that an ELT was being detected near Sheep Mountain. It was soon after determined that an ERA
                helicopter was overdue from a flight plan in that region. Alaska State Troopers from Glennallen
                responded to the area and staged at about Mile 117 of the Glenn Hwy near Tahneta Pass. Although the
                weather was poor RCC did attempt to fly over the area with a fixed wing and helicopter but were
                unsuccessful in being able to get a visual of the search area. When it was confirmed the weather would

                 directional finding equipment in an effort to continue to try to narrow the search area. The terrain
                 included very steep slopes and gorges and was not conducive for a comprehensive ground search. Some
                snow machines were brought to the scene and were utilized with limited capabilities. US Military Para
                Jumpers responded to the scene with surface vehicles and also assisted in the limited ground search
                efforts.

                employed by ETS to 3 remote radio sites, dropping techs off and later picking them up. One of those
                techs has been confirmed to be at the Lions Head site and is safe in a shelter at that site. Ground
                searchers reached the Tahneta site and determined no one had been at the site recently. Searchers have
                not been to the Sawmill site, but earlier reports are that weather may have prevented any techs from
                getting to that. site.
