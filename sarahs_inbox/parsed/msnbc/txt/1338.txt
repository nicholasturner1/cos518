  Hi Todd,

  In today's DHL package heading to the Anchorage office, I sent you the awards for the Look 2 a Book
  Tea. Please sign and return them when you get a chance. I have a return form already filled out and
  taped to the envelope, it's under the original route slip that's addressed to you.

  That was a great picture and article in the Juneau Empire today. What an adorable baby!!
