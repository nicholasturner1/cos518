              Subject: PSA re Ballot Measure 2
               Greetings everyone. Attached is a public service announcement and poster developed last
             week regarding statewide ballot measure #2 scheduled for the primary election on August 26tt',
             sponsored by Bethel's Tribal Council (ONC). The AK Bushmailer donated a full page in their
             August edition that will be distributed to appx 49,000 P.O. boxes through the bush villages, with
             an additional 48,000 thru the Mat Su and Talkeetna area outlets. Scheduled arrival in mailboxes
             should be happening from August I0tt' thru the 15th.
                Anyone who has the interest and ability for whom the message strikes a harmonic chord,
             is welcomefencouraged to distribute further (community bulletin boards, hand-out copies to
             public, localized/regional media etc.) thru other avenues where it could benefit the purpose. It
             could be especially useful for urban constituents. Prior to leaving Anchorage I posted it at
             Alaska Zoo, Sportsman's Warehouse, Sam's Club on Old Seward, and Diamond Mall.
               Also included for review/convenience are a couple word doe's with bullet points surrounding
             the issue. Trust and hope this finds everyone otherwise doing well. Have a good rest of the
             summer and beyond...
