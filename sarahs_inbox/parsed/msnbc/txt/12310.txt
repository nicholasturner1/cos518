             Sharon,
             Our Injury Prevention people wanted to know if Todd Palin was wearing his helmet when he wrecked
             his machine during the Iron Dog , and if so, if he'd be interested in doing a press event or PSA talking
             about how the helmet helped save his head and encouraging others to wear helmets.
             Can you run this by the right folks for us and let me know?
             Thanks,
             Greg
