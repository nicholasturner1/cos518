 The Honorable Sarah Palin
 Governor of Alaska
 PO Box 110001
 Juneau, AK 99811-0001



 Dear Governor Palin:


 Mrs. Palin, I just wanted to express my thanks to you for your support of our
 military and the Global War On Terrorism. I'm proud to say that I'm a resident
 of Alaska with you in office, showing your support for us and our mission to
 defeat Al Qeada in Iraq. I currently work (he is in my unit) with your son in
 1/25 SBCT (Ft. Wainwright) and I'm sure he is extremely proud of how you
 represent us and show the support for the War in Iraq.
 Again, thank you for all that you do as Governor of our Incredible state of
 Alaska.

 God Bless,


 CW2 William "Chip" Steele
