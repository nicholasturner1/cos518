           Has anyone set up the AO/TC-Alaska bill signing yet ? Last week I asked Tom that we do this
           as soon as possible before I head out the last week of the month. I'll be in kenai on
           Saturday and thought that could possibly be a venue for the signing.

              Also, confidentially- we still need to talk and plan around the abortion bills,
           hopefully we can touch on that today. Thanks
