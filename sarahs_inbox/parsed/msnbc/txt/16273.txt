             Governor -



             I have received word that for Thursday, 06.26.08 (road trip) - DPS has,a Turbo Prop -
             Single Engine Plane (Caravan) - 2 pilots that is at your disposal. You have flown in this
             same aircraft last year when you flew into Skagway. It is an 8 seater.



             They can pick you up on Thursday, 06.26.08 at the Wasilla Airstrip at approx. 11:15 a.m.
             for Soldotna.  This is a 45 minute flight. You would land 1 mile from the Soldotna Sport
             Center.



             The Soldotna to Homer Flight time is 20 minutes. Then from Homer back to Wasilla is a 1
             hour and 15 minute flight time. This would take out the 10-12 hour drive time that you
             would be on the road. Something for you to consider - Thanks, Janice                 c
