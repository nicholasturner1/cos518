          Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staff's part. Todd and I can
          serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify reporters if we're doing
          something separate with them. I'm getting out of the loop at this point, pls just let me
          know the progress when the coordination is complete. Thanks

          Hello,

          Who should I coordinate this with to find out details such as time,

          guest count, and how we'd like to extend the invitation(s)?

          Thanks,

          Erika

           Let's do it. Todd and Trig arrive this aft so it'll be the nice

           family/Alaskana setting too.

           I think it is a great idea .        Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA

          pre-briefing at the mansion in January 07.

           How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of

           them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have

           made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!

             Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum
     I
           they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like

           the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.

           Thanks
