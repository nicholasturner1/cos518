              Lieutenant David C. Tugmon
              You asked me to fill out a request for a report that everyone has reused to give me information on.
              1. I started filed a complaint
              2. I do not have a case number because Shanigan refused to give me one.
              3. I've mailed request by email, certified mail and no one will assist me.

              Offer Shanigan contacted me at Wildwood around 6/07/07 and 618/08.

              1 know why everyone doesn't want me to have the report. The question is do you want to be a part of the cover
              up?
              AS11.16.110, AS1156.770 and AS11.56.780 one of these may apply in this case to the Officer involved in this
              matter?

              Now you ask me to fill out a request from without information IE Case Number and questions that would be
              answered by reading the report.
              So I believe this is just another stall tactic. Because you are asking question I can't answer.
              So what would you have me do?


              Regards, Keith
