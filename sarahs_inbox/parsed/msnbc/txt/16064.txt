            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            As a recent resident of Alaska and a continued registered Professional Engineer in Alaska,
            I have a suggestion.




             John McCain has spoken recently about respecting States' opinions on opening offshore
             drilling in their area.




            I suggest Governor Palin ask him to demonstrate this stance by co-authoring a bill with
            the Alaska Senators to open the coastal plain of ANWR (area 1002) for exploration and
            production of its oil and natural gas resources; just like it was planned in the Alaska
            National Interest Lands Conservation Act when ANWR was enlarged to its present size.
                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA_GSPOI 0019321

            John McCain has been speaking this " individual states should decide " point of view several
            times recently . It has been reported in articles such as:




            House panel to consider lifting domestic drill ban



            http://www.usatoday.com/money/ industries / energy / 2008 - 06-10-house -drilling_N.htm




            On a personal note , we left Alaska to assist aging parents in Texas . We hope to return to
            Alaska when our present situation changes .  The continued development of the Resources of
            Alaska will help those job opportunities that will make that possible.




            Congratulations on the birth of your son Trig .      Family is very important and I wish you
            well along with your family.




            Sincerely,




            Todd Hackney
