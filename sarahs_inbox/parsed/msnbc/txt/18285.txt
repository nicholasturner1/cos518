        Dear Mr. McCowan:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        Governor Palin:



        My compliments on your vetoes concerning Capital Projects in SB 53. I urge that you
        continue to focus upon Constitutional-mandated

        services.



        It is a pleasure to see that you are bringing back the concept of public service to state
        government and self-reliance to the people of Alaska.



        Respectfully,



        Mike McCowan
