             MESSAGE:

             Gov. Sarah Palin,




             Thank you for your firm stance on this matter. I am not an Alaskan native, however, I
             know your state is a very valuable resource to all of America (along with others that lay
             dormant).   From what I have researched in the Constitution, you have all the right to
             forego an order from the Feds to drill. I may be wrong, but I still am very proud of your
             stance.   Maybe you can run for the President of the United States of America and John
             McCain can be your VP. Best of luck in the future. Your actions make me proud. You are
             a true leader.




             Regards,




                                                                  1
