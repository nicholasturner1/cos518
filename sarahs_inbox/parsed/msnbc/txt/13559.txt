             Mike N. tells me I'm about ready to inherit his Blackberry, so you'll be

             able to get ahold of me without any problems within a day or two.

             This was done differently, involving students - so maybe this will be

             considered differently, and can credit the student government

             participants.

             Governor,




             Regarding yesterday ' s event -- we were going to send out a presser this

             morning to get better media coverage . Need to see Andy's photos - we can

             attach some . Will get it to you in 15-20 minutes.



             Sharon tells me we haven ' t been getting much media coverage out of

             pressers on bill signings unless its something pretty big . We got a bit

             of coverage out of the revenue sharing release ,          for example.
