           I do remember and I asked Lynne to help me on that one. She got right on it and replied
           back by email that we can print the 70 report online now. It is posted at:

           I meant to double check and see if you were on the distribution list for the email. Sorry
           about that.  I can have the Anchorage office print off a copy for you the next time you
           are in.

           Since I never received MEA's report on coal fired plant - I have to veto their money.



           Remember I asked you to ask them for a copy of the report quite awhile ago.
