             I will return this tomorrow. Kubley is a lobbyist - but he is sent this as a member of
             the Yacht club.  Janice

             J- was the "yacht club poster'-thing (looked like about a 6" blue banner) and laminated
             card that said I'm an honorary member of the Juneau Yacht Club returned to Mr. Kubley? I'm
             sure he's a lobbyist- his gift can't be accepted. Thanks
