             Governor - the only invitation that we've received on this was the notification of the JNU
             one on the Capitol steps. Janice

             Governor:

             I know a Cabinet meeting is scheduled for May 1 - the National Day of Prayer.
             Traditionally an observance has been at noon on the Capitol steps. In Wasilla, from the
             NDP website is the following:

                                                                   1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0016274

             I just didn't know if you were aware that the cabinet meeting is scheduled to conflict
             with this.  I don't have any confirmation about an observance on the Capitol steps this
             year or ANC information.
