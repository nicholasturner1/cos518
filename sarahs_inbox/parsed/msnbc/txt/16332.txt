                Governor,

                Good morning! Here is the Wasilla budget information you requested yesterday. Kris will print off a copy to bring
                to you at the luncheon. I will also make sure Kelly has a copy with her. Please let me know if you have any
                questions or if you need anything else. Just a reminder that the entrance to the Grandview Hotel is through the
                Chili's driveway/parking lot on the Parks Highway. Thank you!

                Kate
