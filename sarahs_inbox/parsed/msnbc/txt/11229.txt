             Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 16th, 2008




             Dear All:



             An ACE charter delivered to Nikolski five drums of #1 heating oil, five

             drums of #2 marine diesel, and one drum of hydraulic fluid, with support

             from APIA, APICDA, Delta Western and the Nikolski IRA Council. This

             delivery will ensure heat, electricity, and heavy equipment for the

             runway for two to three days.



             The Magone Marine vessel, the Redeemer, will take on up to 25,000

            gallons of emergency fuel this evening, intending to set off for

            Nikolski. ETA could be as early as tomorrow afternoon. This emergency

            amount of fuel will keep Nikolski in heat and power until long-term

            plans to avoid this situation can be instituted.



            A new update will follow upon new information. Thank you for your

            attention and interest and please let me know if you need any more

            information.
