             Subject: water mining initiative
            We just notified the sponsors of the water-mining initiative that I was denying
            certification of that initiative (Tim McKeever is their lawyer that we notified). We got
            good input from Sharon on the press release and have made changes there, but have
            not sent that out yet. We will send press release and talking points soon, I believe. (We
            haven't notified the press yet.)
