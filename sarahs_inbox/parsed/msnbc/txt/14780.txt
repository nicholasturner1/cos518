            i realize it's not new news to you but I just read the story of your newest challenges
            with your newborn son and it captured me. As one of who seems to be one of.the few
            republicans in northern California and a father of a son battling his own challenges I can
            only give you my heartfelt wishes for the best life for you, Trig and the rest of your
            family. My best wishes to you and your family.
