         Governor,




         Sharon Illsley (KNI district court) can be reached at Privileged                   Richard Postma (Anchorage
         District Court) can be reached at 269-5156.




         I will call the unsuccessful nominees, contact Chief Justice Fabe, and let the press
         office know to send out the release when I know you've officially appointed these folks.
         I passed this information on to Gary Wheeler as well.




         Thanks so much,




                                                                 1
