          Willow thinks that would be so cool too! Juanita says nope. I may try to talk her into
          this.

          Thanks - Tell Juanita that sometimes we have crazy weeks and it takes me

          the weekend to get caught up! Is she sending Jenna down in January for

          the semester - Jace thinks that would be so cool!

          I need to convention center this week w my friend Sam. Pls schedule on

         Monday... here's his number #         Privileged
          I think Wed/Thurs afternoon is best thanks!

             By the way- Juanita is sitting here with me and she's saying you're

         working too hard. I said "I know"!!! So don't actually schedule this

         until the workweek starts!
