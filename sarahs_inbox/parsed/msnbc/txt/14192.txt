            Sure is.



            His son Dan was trying to convince candidate Sarah into doing the survival suit races with
            him for crab fest in '06.



            Fun stuff.

           Dear Legislators,




              I am contacting you to encourage your vote to confirm Brenda Rabner ' s appointment to
           the Big Game Commercial Services Board . At our recent board meeting in Fairbanks Brenda
           was seated beside me giving me an opportunity to interact with her about Guided , Sport and
           Subsistence hunting . I was impressed with how quickly she understood the issues the board
           was addressing and I believe she will bring a very valuable view to the board.




               Some of you have no doubt heard how well the BGCSB members have worked together . Brenda
            Rabner will be a strong voice for the large Private Landowners in the State and also work
            well with the existing board members.




              Please vote yes to confirm Brenda ' s appointment.




              Thank You,    Richard Rohrer (Dick)



                                    Master Guide # 69
