               I am opposed to proposal #44823 in HB 311 which would give an appropriation of
               funds for a boat launch with 75-100 capacity parking on the Kasilof River at
               Trujillo's Landing - Ed's Kasilof Seafoods. There has been no public notification,
               concept design, or public concern addressed. They are trying to circumvent the
               public process. A boat launch would devastate habitat along the Lower Kasilof
               River, this fishery cannot withstand that kind of pressure. The two-stroke engines
               now banned from the Kenai would now go to the Lower Kasilof and the health of the
               river would be at stake. It would also disrupt long established, quiet local
               neighborhoods. Please do not pass this in the budget.

                Thank you,
                Audrey Stephens
                Kasilof, Alaska
