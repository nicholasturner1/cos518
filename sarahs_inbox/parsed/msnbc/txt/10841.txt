            FB- would u call Stoltze and tell him "we" didn't make this cut.



            Do u think they'd have cut a sport fish weir in the city of Juneau? No.

            I'll need to ask Denby. I saw he was on the email list but I will give him a call in a
            little bit.

           Mike - why'd the fish gate ($55g) get cut out of fish and game budget? Out of a $10m budget
           this isn 't a good cut.
