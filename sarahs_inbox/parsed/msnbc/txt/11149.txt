             Hello all,




             Hope everyone is having a great 2008! I wanted to see if you can pass on the word that
             MEDIAK is back and we're having an open house next Thursday, January 17 from 5:00 to 7:00
             p.m.  The open house is a great chance for new students and their parents or guardians to
             see what MEDIAK is all about. Of course there will be FREE FOOD and a chance to see what
             the magazine, radio and video clubs are doing. Tell everyone to come by and have a snack
             and see what MEDIAK is producing. Once they're here, they'll be hooked. :o)
             Quyanagpak!!I  Thank you very much!
