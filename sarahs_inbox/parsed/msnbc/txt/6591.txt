        Dear Mr. McKeever:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

       Governor

        Just reviewed all of your line item vetoes to the capital budjet.



        Go, girl, go! Well done!



        It's about time someone said that not every problem in this state mandates state spending.



        Some of the items vetoed would fund the kind of work my company does. However, I still
        say you done good.



        You know, of course, a shit storm is heading your way. Hang in there. There are many
        people in this state who are behind you when it comes to reducing State spending.



        Pleasantly Surprised & Respectfully Yours,



        Bill McKeever
