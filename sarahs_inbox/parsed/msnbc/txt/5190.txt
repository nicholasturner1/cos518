              Governor,



               Following our phone call yesterday related to gasline issues, Marty R.

               asked me two questions, the first had to do with what the gasline team

               (Rutherford, Anders, Balash, Galvin) can do to better involve you. I

               suggested that she call your scheduler once a week, at minimum, to get

               on your calendar and update you on progress and ask for direction.



               Second, she said my role on the gasline was "less than clear" to her

               given the discussion that was had related to the federal side. I told

              her that what I took from the conversation was that you personally

              wanted to take a stronger, leadership role on the federal side. Also,

               even though I didn't say it, I really didn't know how to interpret

              your silence to my discussion of what I thought my gasline role was

               for you (advance work on the federal side). I am reluctant to move,

              however, without clear direction from you.



               Please tell me what role you want me to play, if any. I will support

              you and move forward in whatever way you want, but I do need some

               clarity on it.



              Regards,



              Sean
