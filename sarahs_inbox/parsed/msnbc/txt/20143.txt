            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov. Palin & Family,




            Congratulations on the birth of Trig. I'm a father of a 2 1/2 year old with Down syndrome
            named Calvin. I know it's been a difficult and joyous time all at the same time, but thank
            you for sharing your story with the public. I'm sure you've learned a lot, and 2 1/2 years
            later I still feel like I'm learning alot about raising a child with Ds. I wish Trig, and
            the rest of your family all the best.




            Take care,



            Jeremey Poindexter

           P.S. I worked in politics ( Gov. John Engler, Rep. Mike Rogers, and several state political
           jobs ) for 10 years before going to law school, and I really admire the work you are doing.
