             I'm so happy ! It went well .       Kristan & Tom owned it. The majority of

             callers were positive . Andrew called at the end and sounded so worked

             up. We thought he was crying at one point .             It was so awesome .       I think

             it's safe to say you would have been proud.



             We need to take this on the road.



             Prior to the show ,    we - Kristan ,    Tom, Dick ,    Joe A .,   Joe S .,   and Tina

             all met and prepped .      We have a good plan ,       and we ' re sticking to it.

             Board meeting is tomorrow .       I'll report on anything new after that.




             On another note ,    I met w/ Sherri Buretta today regarding Statehood.

             During the meeting she said that she is so impressed with you .                  You are

             not afraid to speak the truth and it is so refreshing .                 It is time for

             the positive change you ' re bringing about.

             Kristan and Tom are doing a great job on Pagans

             show.For Tom to change his flight schedule to

             participate on the show is just another example of his

             character,unlike others who pick and chose which

             issues they want to be involved in.
