  Ch 82 SLA 06 appropriates a designated grant thru DCCED to Whale Pass
  Community Association for Alaska Power and Telephone Line Extension in the
  amount of $36,000 general funds. The project was added to the bill by
  legislature.

  Hi Karen,

  I was wondering if you could find out if there was money in the capital budget any time in the last four
  years for Alaska Power and Telephone Company and what the funding source was.

  Thanks, Lynne
