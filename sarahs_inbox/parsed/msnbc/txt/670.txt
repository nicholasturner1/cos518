Hello Erika,



 I was going to fly to Kotzebue this morning with com Bishop. I planned on letting you know about the
trip when I returned Tuesday night. It was a last minuite invatation from com BIshop on Friday, he
called me Saturday and said my flights were takebn care of.



 I'm at the airport with no ticket, I've tried to contact comm Bishop but he must be traveling from
Fairbanks this morning.



Would you have comm Bishops assistances number.



Thnaks todd
