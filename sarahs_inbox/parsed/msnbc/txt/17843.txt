            Governor:
            Just a little more information about tomorrow:
            After you introduce each winner of the Denali Peak Performance Awards (4 individual and one
            team); they've been advised that they can offer short remarks . I just wanted to be sure you
            were aware of that . So, for instance after you give your opening remarks and then announce
            Kathy Perham-Hester, Public Health Specialist as the winner of the Co -Worker Award - I'll
            hand her the award since she'll be in ANC - we need to pause as I ask her if she wants to say
            anything . The next award - Irene Ferguson/Sitka will be in Juneau with you , and you'll be able
            to ask her if she wants to offer any comments....

            I hope that is ok with you. Anna and Kevin Brooks , my deputy commissioner , will be there with
            you and will help all of us stay on track.

            Kari,

            Attached is what the Governor needs in preparation for tomorrow 's Denali Awards.

            Sharon,

            I changed the script some to correct the number of people and add a blip about National Employee Recognition.
