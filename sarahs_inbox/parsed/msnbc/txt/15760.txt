         MESSAGE:

         Governor Palin,




         I have seen you speak on various programs recently and have read about you. From what I
         have read, I sincerely hope that more people like you run for office, stay in office, and
         help run this great nation.




         I applaud your honesty, family values, and straight-forward, no- nonsense approach to deal
         with issues relating to our country.




                                                               1
