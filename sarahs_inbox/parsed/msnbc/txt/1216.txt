MESSAGE:

Would like to extend my congratulations along to Mrs.Palin and her family on the birth of her son. As
a fellow "over-40" mother, I was amused at the flight from Texas to AK for the birth. Made me think
of the pioneer women that worked in the fields, went home and gave birth and then returned to the
fields. lol How did you manage to let them let you on the plane?



I have 4 kids with my last being born at age 43. There are times when folks ask if I'm his Grandma.
lol I don;t color my hair and am rather grey these days.



So congrats and hope you're back on your feet soon. Give the little bugger a nose tweak for me. :)
