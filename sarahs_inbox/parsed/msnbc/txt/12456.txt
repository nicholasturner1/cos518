                Dear Beth,

                Thank you for your e-mail. I have just returned home this evening to Santa Fe, New Mexico,
                after being in Washington for our meeting, and was thinking on the plane that one of the first
                people to whom I wanted to write was you.

                Governor Palin was absolutely fantastic . Her talk was excellent . (It was obvious that someone
                had done some research. on the Hoover Institution -- which was great! ) and she did a superb job
                during the Q&A. I heard people afterward saying things like " She's a real fireball. We need
                more people in government like her ." Other adjectives I heard were "genuine, unaffected,
                straightforward, thoughtful." She was, in other words , a total success. I hope you will convey to
                her our dew appreciation for having made time for us in her schedule.

                The meeting was, overall, from the accounts that I am hearing, a real success, and Governor
                Palin was a very important part of it all.

                Again, many, many thanks for all your help. Janice Mason was hugely helpful, too. Please
                convey my thanks to her as well.

                All the very best,

                Noel

                I know you put in incredible effort to make it a success.

                When you get the opportunity, let me know how Gov. Palin's remarks went.
                And please send me the audio/video when it's available.

                With Warmest Regards,
