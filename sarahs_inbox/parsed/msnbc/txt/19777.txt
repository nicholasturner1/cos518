           MESSAGE:

           I had a phone call from Ms. Rymmilva at (907)378-3002 regarding some original 49 star
           flags I have. She indicated your office would like to have more. We have more, and need
           to talk with her about them. You apparently bought some previously that we took to Juneau
           on a visit in 2002. Our # is (714)543-9422




           Thank you
