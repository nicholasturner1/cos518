Hi Todd,

Here's the flight information for the girls, sorry it's so late!



Tuesday, March 6th

AK Airlines

Flt. 67 Jnu-Anc.

Dep. 7:45pm An. 9:33pm.



Bristol and Willow's Confirmation Code: FNVRWI

Piper's Confirmation Code: JMBIMV



Sunday, March 11th

Flt. 64 Anc-Jnu

Dep. 11:47am.

An. 1:27pm.




I didn't book this flight, security already had tkts. for them on

Thursday, so they just made the changes. I'm not sure why Piper has a

different conf. number, but I think she was probably booked when the

Governor was.
