           Bob stated that it is due to maintenance. After it flies so many hours

           it has to go in for a check up. It should only be a 10-day check up.



           Also, I have been asked to notify you of an upcoming Media Trip that

           would need to happen on May 28 (you would depart this day). This is the

           beginning of the AGIA Briefings that you would start off with and then

           fly out to New York for a day of Media May 29 and then to Washington, DC

           for a day of Media May 30. In talking with Bruce Anders he stated that

           as long as you were here for the beginning opening of the AGIA Briefings

           that should be fine. They do not feel that there is any other time more

           appropriate then those dates for the Media availability for AGIA. This

           is something that would need to be set up right away so that we do not

           lose this opportunity.      Thanks, Janice
