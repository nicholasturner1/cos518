           Hello Governor Palin,

           I am a 40 year old Mother of five ( ages 8 to 6 months )and I wish to send my
           congradulations along to you.

           My husband and I honeymooned in Alaska in August of 1998 and we've held a torch for your
           beloved state since then.

           Peter (my husband) and I own our own business and I too showed up to work days after all
           of my children were born and yes I also take them to work.

           I wish you luck, and a swift deliver.

           Good luck and God Bless you.



           Best regards,



           Linda Donovan!
