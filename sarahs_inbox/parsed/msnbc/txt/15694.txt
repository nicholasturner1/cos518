            As a resident of Bethel, I am encouraging you to support the $2million for the Bethel
            Regional Aquatic Training Center.



            This center will improve the quality of life in rural Alaska. It can also provide a place
            to learn swimming and water safety and save lives.



           We have increased out tax rate 20% to support this center. I would hope the state would
           provide some support also.



            Thank you
