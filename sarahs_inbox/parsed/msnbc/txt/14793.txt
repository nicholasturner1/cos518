            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            Congratulations to you, to your husband and to your children on the birth of your new
            child. May God continue to bless and look after you and your family.



            I just read about your remarkable record of service to the great state of Alaska on the
            Internet. VERY impressive!




            Any chance you might consider running for national office? All of us in the U.S. (not to
            mention the lower 48) could certainly benefit from your leadership, your committment to
            traditional values and your obvious fortitude of courage. We seem to be lacking most of
            these qualities in our national leaders these days...



            Again, may God continue to bless you and your family!



            Best Regards,



            Brian T. Bingham
                                                                  1
