           Privileged or Personal M I never heard back from anyone on this
                                                                       issue after requesting that
           everyone wor on a coordinated pr plan, then get back to me with the plan of action.



           And are u talking about waiting for Kelly Goode? As new leg liason she wasn't to be
           instrumental in AGIA communications plan - though her ideas will be very helpful - it
           seems we've been working on AGIA communications plan many months before she came on board.

           I'm sitting here with Joe and Sharon and Joe answered your question by saying we need to
           wait for Kelly to be here in person to discuss the plan with her -- that it's too hard to
           discuss over email.

            What did the AGIA team say about that, though? Is everyone on the same page with the AGIA
           messaging plan ? (Which I'll need to know at some point.)
