         Good quotes for Hollis.



         It's not a matter of needing thicker skin tho, it's a matter of stating truth, firmly, so
         Alaskans can trust our motives and actions . All too often we hear publicly something
         that' s spun political , it's our job to set it straight and then let Alaskans judge for
         themselves . It won' t be a knee -jerk reaction when we respond appropriately and timely to
         anything we know is being used to deceive the public.



         A reporter is meeting me in a few minutes on wolf control - but he ' ll no doubt ask about
         ACES and politics, too.



         Hollis laid out serious allegations about dissent from within .                We'll now answer it.
