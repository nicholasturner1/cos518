        Super story about you in the ADN! It was great. Kizzia could have added so much more
        about your interesting background, your passion for Alaska, your expertise in natural
        resources, etc... but what he covered was very good.



        Alaska is truly fortunate to have you. Thanks again for making sacrifices and joining this
        team. Ya' gotta beleive it will be worth it for our kids' sake!



        You're a great woman, Marty. Thanks for everything.
