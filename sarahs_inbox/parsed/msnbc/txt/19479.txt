           Excellent idea. I'll do it. I can be there all day Wednesday, then not again for awhile.
           If lawmakers leave Juneau we can do a reception in Anchorage at any time this next week.

           Governor,



           Sorry. One more thing: I think you need one more reception just to get the pulse of the
           legislators and see where they ' re coming from at this point. Proponents are getting
           restless , critics are delaying a decision . Perhaps pulling everyone together in one
           mansion just for an informal reception might be good after you return . I'll rely on you to
           tell me what's good timing , or if it's a good . idea or good timing at all.



           Thanks,

           meghan
