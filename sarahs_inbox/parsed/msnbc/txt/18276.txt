          Dear Mr . Dempsay:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control , manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

         know you can't make everyone happy. I do appreciate the efforts you made to stay within
         your guidelines during this tough process. I hope next year that the legislators will do
         their part so you don't have to shoulder the whole load and take all the heat.
