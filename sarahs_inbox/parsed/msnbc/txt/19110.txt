          Governor - Pat Toomey just called and asked if you would call him directly .   610-360-6838.
            Mr. Toomey wants to speak with you in regards to : Alaska Politics .   He said that if a
          call needs to be scheduled then we can go through his scheduler Stacey .   I would be happy
          to set that up if needed . Janice
