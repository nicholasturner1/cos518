             MESSAGE:

             Just wanted to congratulate you on your recent blessing. Caught the story at the tail end
             of Glen Beck of CNN. Nice to know that we still have inspirational leaders in this country
             and coming from embattled New York State, that is indeed a refreshing revelation. If John
             McCain considers you for V.P., your candidacy would get my vote.



             All the best,

             Randy Morrison
