             I say its a great excuse to privatize. Jack Barber or other outfits would love our
             business.  This is nuts.

            Tell DPS that this is really outrageous. We're going on two years now.

               And now do folks see why I keep saying we can NOT rely on them and their promises to
            allow our office any reliable use of aircraft? This really is a final straw. I do NOT want
            to hear them string us along again- but please send them the message that this is very,
            very disappointing and now we're moving on and away from ever relying on that mode of
            transportation.

                                                                   1
