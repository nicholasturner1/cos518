Janice,



Can we set up some sort of on line book so other Alaskans can read these amazing emails from all
across the country.

MESSAGE:

I Just wanted to say Congratulations! to the Palin family on their new

arrival. I am glad to hear that she made it up to Alaska safely for the

delivery. Will there be any sort of online book that Alaskans can

digitally sign or a place that we can send cards to? Our family is

sending our prayers her way and continuing to think fond thoughts. Thank

You!
