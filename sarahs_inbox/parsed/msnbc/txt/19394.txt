           I wanted to make sure that you had the latest version of the proposed energy letter
           (attached).  This is probably the 12th version of the letter. As you'll recall, Sam has
           previously provided written briefings and updates.



           I^don't know what the dynamics will be when the Governors get together. For me, this has
           primarily become an academic exercise that will most likely have little impact on federal
           policy.  In order to resolve substantial differences among Governors, the draft has become
           progressively less sharp in expression.



           Please let me know if I can help further. Hope you're having some fun.

             Re:   Latest version of NR Committee Energy Letter




             Attached please find the latest version of the NR Committee Energy letter. Copies will be
             provided to your governors at the Governors Only session on Sunday, July 13.




             The only changes to the letter are the addition of compromise options and language
             addressing oil shale that was agreed to by Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.




             Please call my cell phone with any questions:      Privileged or Perk
