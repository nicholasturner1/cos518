          J-pls find out how long that deactivation ceremony is today. Also, for sched pls note I'll
          be meeting with some Fish and Game folks up here- I'll let you know when exactly for the
          TA and schedule.

             Also, I could look at the Sitka ceremony on Saturday if it works out for me to get to
          Juneau at the end of the week to help Erika close down the house for the three months...
          We'll need to get our clothes out of there and other things the First Family will need
          over the next quarter. Pls ask Linda P., or whomever, if it's ok to bring one-ofd the kids
          with me to help me pack up their clothes and items before Erika puts everything in storage
          or under visquene for the coming months.
