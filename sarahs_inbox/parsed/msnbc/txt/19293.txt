         The State pays for the NGA trip. RGA always has meetings around NGA but

         I have never known RGA to pay for any portions of the actual travel to

         NGA meetings.     Janice

         Is NGA or the state paying for the NGA conf trip? Does the RGA pay for

         any portion of it, as some of the functions are RGA-centric?

               Ok, got it. I appreciate your take on this and I sincerely appreciate all your hard work on this, and
               AGIA. It was interesting to watch Stevens the other day though in our presser as he rolled out his
               "energy plan" with caveats left and right explaining these were "ideas, proposals... needed to be
               fleshed out in DC, etc," obviously having learned not to get himself in a box with some solid
               PLAN that he'd later perhaps have to amend. We've rolled out thin timelines before that we
               later had                          nstar plan I'd like, Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

               Sorry, I'm just a little on-edge after the past couple of days. This whole gasline episode has been a long and
               exhausting ordeal.

              Governor, Kris,

              Here is what I believe to be the "final" concept paper for the "In-State Gas" Conference on Monday. This paper has the
              blessing of both ANGDA and ENSTAR and this is the concept we are all working off. And, hopefully, their comments will
              be pegged off it as well. The following people will be at the press event, although other representatives from the entities may
              show-up:



              ENSTAR:

              Gene Dubay, Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems (owner company of ENSTAR)

              Colleen Starring, Regional VP for ENSTAR

              ANGDA:

              Scott Heyworth, Acting Chairman

              Harold Heim, CEO



              Administration:

              Tom Irwin, DNR

              Joe Balash, Gov's Ofc

              Marcia Davis, DOR

              Marty Rutherford, DNR



              I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for 1:00pm on Monday , July 7th, in your Anchorage
              Conference Room . They have also been advised that you will be announcing this formation of a project development venture
              (a public/private partnership) and will be laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and Harold
              Heine making brief statements . I have asked everyone to be at your offices about 15 minutes ahead of time as you may
              want to go into the Conference Room together



              I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you, Governor. Should you wish anything else, please let me
              know. My cell phone # : 317-4728.



              Also, we have identified a series of people to pre-message this announcement to and we will be making those calls on Sunday
              evening and early Monday.



              Thanks for all your support, Governor, and for your recognition that dealing with in-state gas needs is critical ! It was a great
              insight that I believe will push the AGIA License over the edge!
