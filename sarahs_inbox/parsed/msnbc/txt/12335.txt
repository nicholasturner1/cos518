            Governor:



            I am the military Funeral Honors NCIOC For this fine state and I have just had some very
            upsetting news brought to my attention. There have been thousands of remains of vets found
            in basements and closets of Funeral homes across our Nation. I am writing to see if this
            is happening in our fine state that you or your Staff know of, and if so Would you as the
            governor of this Great State be willing to help me in fixing this.

             I as Funeral Honors NCIOC for the state Find this very sad that this is being allowing
            to happen to our fallen Bothers and sisters to be treated this way. I take the job I do
            for this State in Funeral Honors very serious and think that no soldier should be put to
            rest without the respect of his/her country or state.In this case not yet being put to
            rest but setting on shelves awaiting their Honors that they are owed.
