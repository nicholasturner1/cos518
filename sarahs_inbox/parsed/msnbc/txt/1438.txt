Todd - We received this email asking for a letter of recommendation from the Governor. Do you or
the Governor know him?

Message:Dear Governor Palin:



I am currently applying to the Naval Academy for next fall.

Knowing me through High School Sports, and living in the Valley I was hoping you would consider
writing a letter of recommendation on my behalf. The Blue and Gold Office I am working with
suggested a letter to Rep Don Young and/or a letter to include in my application file.



If you would like to meet with me I am available, and I do have a resume of my High School
accomplishments available.



Thank you for your consideration,

Bradley Truax
