                 Subject: RurAL CAP Remarks

               I've attached the remarks for the RurAL CAP luncheon. I'm also sending them on to Beth for
               tweaking.

               But I'd like you to take a look at the way I've formatted the remarks.

               As a newcomer to your administration, I'm not familiar with how your speeches are prepared.

               But as a broadcaster , I think this format is easier to deliver.

               Looking forward to seeing you and checking out your "baby bump."

               I know you are extremely busy , but your presence at the RurAL CAP luncheon will help
               support my work on the board , which I very much appreciate.

               Yours,

               Rhonda
