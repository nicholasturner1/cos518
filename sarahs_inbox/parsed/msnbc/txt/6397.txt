              Subject: Task Force to Review the Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault

            Hi Governor,

           You may recall signing 15 bills into law on July 31d. One of those bills was HB 215, sponsored by Rep. Anna
           Fairclough.

           HB 215 establishes the task force to review the Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. This
           task force would prepare and present a report to the full Legislature by March 1, 2008 - and then will be
           repealed on April 16, 2008 . The task force would bring members of the Legislature and administration
           together with members of the public to have frank and comprehensive discussions about the council and
           the issues it addresses.

           Rep. Fairclough's chief-of-staff is staffing the task force and has scheduled the first meeting this Friday
           (Aug. 3'd) to elect a chair and to set a six-month agenda before Rep. Fairclough leaves town for the next
           three weeks.

           As governor, you appoint 5 members of your administration (a representative from Law, Corrections,
           Education, DHSS, and Public Safety), and two public members (1 from a pop. of less than 2,500 and 1
           from a pop. of more than 2,500). I've contacted your commissioners and their special assistants to see
           whom they recommend for this board, as well as talked to Rep. Fairclough and the executive directors of
           the Network on DVSA and the Council on DVSA to come up with public member recommendations.

           Here are the names that have come forward from your commissioners for your review:
           Corrections: IPrivileaed or Personal Material Redacted
           Education: Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           DHSS: Privile ed or Personal Material Redacted
           Public Safety : Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Law: Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

           Here are the names that have come forward from Rep. Fairclough, and people interested in serving in
           public seats:
           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           I can brief you more tomorrow, I just wanted to make sure you had a heads up as this progresses.
           Thank you for your time Governor! Hope all is well up north.

           See you soon,
