           MESSAGE:

           Last nights channel 2 news made reference to requests for open e-mails from the Governor.
           In an on camera interview that aired with that same news byte the Governor made reference
           to those who disagree with her, those calling for her accountability as in the
           investigation around her, she referenced "those people, the haters". It concerns me that
           anyone in a position such as Governor that accuses those who disagree with her or hold her
           accountable as a "hater" is very damaging, irresponsible and inappropriate behavior. To
           name call the public "haters". What is that?




          Now that you are under an investigation, suddenly Ted Stevens is innocent till proven
          guilty. But not so the others before you were under investigation.



          It appears you haven't the maturity or guts and decency as a leader to speak to or answer
          P.O.M.s that disagree with you?



          Seems you are in way over your head and abilities.



          Concerned for our state,




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0022666
