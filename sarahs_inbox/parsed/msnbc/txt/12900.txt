            address: PO Box 530 Kotzebue AK 99752




            MESSAGE:

            We understand that you have been discussed as a possible choice for the Vice Presidency.




           As people who support the democratic process and care about protecting our wildlife for
           future generations, we want you to know that we don't believe people in our states would
           vote for you for any office if they knew your record on these issues.




            It is troubling that you are now working to deny more than 50,000 Alaskans a vote on
            aerial killing of wolves and bears with legislation now being considered in the Alaska
            legislature.




            It is deeply concerning that last year you proposed using helicopters and a $150 bounty to
            spur wolf killing in specified management zones -- despite strong scientific opposition to
            the state's aerial hunting program and the lack of reliable information on how many wolves
                                                                  1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0013392

             actually exist in these areas.




             And it is baffling that you appointed your high school basketball coach -- a man with no
             relevant experience   -- to the state ' s board of game , and have condoned a $400 , 000 state-
             funded propaganda campaign to convince Alaskans that wildlife biologists from around the
             world are wrong when they say that the state ' s shooting of wolves and bears from airplanes
             is scientifically unfounded.




            We sincerely hope that you will recognize the importance of respecting the democratic
            process and protecting Alaska's wildlife in the future . But until then , you will not have
            the support of those of us who care about the democratic process and protecting our
            natural treasures for future generations.
