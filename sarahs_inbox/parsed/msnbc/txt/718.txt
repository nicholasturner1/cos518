Frank,



Hope you had a fun night with the "Bailey munchkins." My son is 13. It's hard to believe he was
once a munchin. Am attaching some pix of his costume. Of all things... he decided he wanted to be
a "moose nugget." I guess he's a real Alaska boy.



As for your questions about Rural CAP... I'm familiar with the agency, but not with the Governor's
appointment . With my graveyard schedule , I've not been so good about reading the newspaper
thoroughly. So I'm not sure what you're referring to.



Is an appointment about to be made?



Thanks,



Rhonda
