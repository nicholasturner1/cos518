          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,




          First let me congratulate you on the birth of your child. Alaska is proud of the hard work
          you do and wish you and your family all the best.

          I am deeply concerned about fuel costs and am fearful of the impact it is having on my
          family, our own town as well as our state and country.

          I am a Case




                                                               1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0016398
