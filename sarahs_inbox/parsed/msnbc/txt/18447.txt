        Pat, Joe and I have been discussing the outstanding items for tomorrow.

        The two big remaining jobs are the charts and your talking points. The

        charts are pretty much ready to go to print other than the name of our

        new plan .     We could complete that tonight or first thing in the morning

        to get them ready by 2 : 00pm .        Did you want to go with Privileged or Personal Mo

       Privileged or Personal Mated r>


        The other item is the talking points .            Beth has made changes and Pat

        made additional corrections beyond that .            Shall we keep fine tuning or

        are you down the road making edits? Please let me know if there is

        something I can do to help finalize the talking points.



        Mike
