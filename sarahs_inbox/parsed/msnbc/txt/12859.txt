                Are we still looking for help in the media relations /communications area?

                Alyse came across a woman (who interviewed for a management 'ob where Al se is
                working) with an outstanding pedigree in that field. Her name is Privileged or Personal Ma
                Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                I've attached her resume. Let me know if you want Alyse to have Privileged or 9 submit
                something more formal.

                Hope this helps.
