Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items was a
package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch w/Binkley and his
wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It
was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500.:)
