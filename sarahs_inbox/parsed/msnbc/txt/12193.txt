                  Subject: good point

                "Sen. Tom Wagoner, a Republican from Kenai, said he found it "intriguing" that the company was
                proceeding without the fiscal framework it said was needed to make the project happen."

                In reference to CP moving forward this summer with their proposal. Seems like it would be good to keep
                reiterating this point to critics and others.
