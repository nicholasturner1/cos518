            Subject: Telephone Call




            Governor -



            Just received a call from a Tammy Brown (Wasilla).          She said that she is the daughter of
            Betty (you know as Gypsy Lady). Betty passed away           Sunday evening. Tammy stated that she
            always told her mom that she would let you know if          anything happened to her. We did
            receive notice from the ADN obits section and will          do condolence letter. Janice
