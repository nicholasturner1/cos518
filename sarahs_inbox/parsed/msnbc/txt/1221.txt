MESSAGE:

Governor Palin,



Congratulations on your new baby . What a blessing he will be to your family. Eight months ago I
delivered my forth child, at birth he was diagnosed with Down Syndrome . I did not have the
advantage of having early tests, but now realize what a special child I have been given. Thoughout
the trials that might arise , keep in mind you have been chosen to be Trig's mom for a reason. God
knows what you are capable of and that is why you were given Trig as YOUR gift. I have come to
realize that my Kempton is a gift to me , to keep and care for . He has already taught me so much.
Congratulations again and may you have all the love and support you deserve from friends and
family.



From one mother to another,

Jessica Beagley
