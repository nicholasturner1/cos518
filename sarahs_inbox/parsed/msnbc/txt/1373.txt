Subject: Hamey Financial - Family Planning




Todd -



I just received a call from Jerrod Hamey with Hamey Financial here in JNU. Mr. Hamey stated that
he had dropped off a package to the Governor approx. 4 weeks ago in regards to Life Insurance -
Planning for Family. He realizes that she has been booked solid but would like to meet in these
regards for approx. 10-15 minutes to explain packet of material on a one-to-one basis. I explained
that the Governor was in the ANC office at this time in which he informed me that he travels
frequently between ANC/JNU.



Contact: Jerrod Harney 723-2433 (cell)



Let me know if you would like me to call him to set up an appointment or decline the request.
Thanks, Janice
