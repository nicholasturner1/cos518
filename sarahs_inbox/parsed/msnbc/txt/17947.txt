             Hi Mary - The legislature certainly wrestled with education funding this session. Certainly some
             significant pieces, including the $77.5 million for TRS to buy the rate down to 12.56%, 50% of
             the ISER study, and over $21 million for school improvement grants will make a difference at
             the classroom level. Legislative action to put $1 billion of the FY2007 surplus into the public
             education fund provides a tremendous oppportunity to actually achieve forward and early
             funding. The commitment of the legislature to work on the funding formula over the interim
             with recommended changes by September 1 is also good news so that the public and school
             districts will be able to weigh in on the work of the task force. The administration is committed
             to working with the legislature on this issue.

             Thanks for all the hard work you do for Alaska's students and families! Karen

                      Dear Governor Palin, and Karen,

                      I am forwarding a message sent to our Great Alaska School, Citizen Coalition (volunteer
                      email network) about 8 days ago. I believe the counsel on education funding is as
                      pertinent today, as then. The closed doors negotiations , and lack of public process by
                      the Alaska Legislature is unwarranted and wrong.

                      However, in the short term, kids deserve access to improvements and and resources.
                       Simply because there has been an intolerable process is no excuse to NOT invest
                      sufficiently to make a difference at the classroom level.

                      I urge you to take the lead and influence this process at the 11th hour . Alaska's
                      students deserve more than status quo quality, whether they live in rural or urban
                      Alaska . It is time to add something at the classroom level (exceeding retirement and
                      maintenance level costs).

                      In the longer term, work with the Legislature to resolve this impasse . All kids deserve a
                      great education . It's time Alaska took a long hard look at what it takes to make this
                      possible.

                      Thank you.

                           Great Alaska Schools

                          The oil lobby is powerful in Alaska, and has been for a long long time . The news of the last few days is
                          sobering, but the influence of big oil should never be minimized. It is merely more evident now.

                          However, there is another more powerful, and ethical lobby. It is citizens, like us, who care enough to
                          speak up on issues near and dear to us. There is no monetary gain. Only the incentive to create stronger,
                          more vibrant communities and better schools where our children, our neighbors children, truly have the
                          opportunity to learn and thrive.

                          It is time for us to speak up, as loudly and as articulately as we can. AND as quickly as we can . There are
                          but 9 days left in the legislative session, and school funding remains in limbo . Legislators are rewriting
                          the foundation formula behind closed doors, without benefit of public input or scrutiny. This is wrong.
                          Nothing as essential and fundamentally important as public school funding should be negotiated behind
                          closed doors, with no opportunity for public debate and oversight.

                          At this point, we still do not know whether Legislative proposals will mean increases, cuts, or status quo funding for
                          schools. The last proposal that was discussed openly included increases for some districts , cuts for some (including
                          Juneau), and status quo funding for others.

                          Our message: End this session on a positive note. Invest in Alaska's kids. If the Legislature intends to
                          address substantive changes in the school funding formula, revisit these changes next session in the clear
                          light of day, with full public input. Meanwhile, we challenge the Alaska State Legislature to actually
                          make a difference at the classroom level for students across Alaska. Fund schools so that kids actually
                          feel the difference.

                          School Boards have long lists of needs - whether text books , computers, teacher training, classroom supplies,
                          substitute teachers , pay for special education aids. Each district's needs are somewhat different. However, School
                          Boards are doing their best to address the complex job of helping all kids succeed , and we, the citizens, are watch
                          dogging that process at the local level.

                          Here is the legislative list, corrected for one error.

                          Here's a message idea:

                          To the Alaska State Legislature,

                          End this session on a positive note. How? By increasing your investment in Alaska 's students. lama
                          parent of                        . My children need and deserve great schools . It takes more than wishful
                          thinking, or punitive laws to improve Alaska 's schools. Funding is pivotal in determining the quality of
                          Alaska 's schools. I ask that you go beyond funding the status quo, and invest more. Increase resources
                          available to Alaska 's teachers, and opportunitiesfor Alaska 's kids.

                          Ifyou enact substantive changes in the foundation formula, I ask that you revisit these changes next
                          session, withfull public debate and participation. Something as critical as funding of public education
                          should not be decided behind closed doors, at the end of the legislative session.

                          Sincerely,



                          You can also go to www.legis,state .ak.uus < httD ://www.leg is.state . ak.us/> to send a Public
                          Opinion Message, track issues, or find legislators' phone numbers.
                          In addition to mails, phone calls to legislators are great !

                          Take 10 minutes now to call or write your legislators, or all legislators
                          (above) while it's on your mind.
                          Time is of the essence.

                          Your voice matters.
