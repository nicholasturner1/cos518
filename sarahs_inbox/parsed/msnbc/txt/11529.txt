             Ha! That's exactly what I was thinking of.



             It flippin ticks me off that we have to worry about this stuff. I mean the governor is
             trying to run a little thing I like to call the state of alaska, and we have to worry
             about someone possibly leaking info.

                     it is too flippin' fishy and there just seems to be too much of these

                    True, true. And no way to stop it - I was just thinking on the flt

                    though it's fishy again that things talked about internally end up

                    blogggd. Never ending mysteries there though. Sigh.

                     Kris. . .did we know who rfn was?



                    My understanding was that there were non-media types on that press

                     release mailing list also... and that it was a compilation of a few media

                     lists (sounded like a mess last year when I tried to find Juneau-only

                    media...gave up and just built one myself).



                    It'd be interesting to see what Sharon turns up. It'd be very easy for

                    a mole to get on that list. . .they probably just emailed and asked to get

                    on it.

                    There ' s a blogger named rfn. He started off as a big supporter , now he's

                    a critic who picks and chooses what issues to support us on. This

                    morning he posted the press release we sent out 4:45pm yesterday on

                    Conoco" s response ... and added that, essentially, I over-react and panic

                    with responding via pressers -like it's a bad thing. How would this

                    blogger have received the emailed presser unless he's a valid media

                    person (and why would a legit media person bother to be a regular

                    blogger?), or one of our folks sent it to him?



                    Strange thing is yesterday it was one of our folks who, as he does so

                    often, warned me I'd again look like I was over-reacting... and he did

                    not want any pressers going out... He cautions often that it doesn't do

                    any good and even though he say he agrees with me that we should be

                    communicating more often and clearer with the public, he is very,         very

                    hesitant to ever want pressers or statements going out in response to

                    timely issues.



                    Trying to put two and two together here, trying to remember if this is

                    the blogger who criticizes me but says very supportive things of a

                    select few in the administration.
