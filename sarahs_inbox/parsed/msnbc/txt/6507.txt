         FYI - we did ask law to review and give us legal advise on the constitutional question
         Beth raised.

        Subject: COMMUNICATIONs-         Harris's poll on where to hold the special session



        Talis: pis have someone look into Beth's reference to sep of powers regarding my ability
        to mandate location of special session.



        I hear there' s insistence that i CAN'T tell them where to meet.



        I gave statements to ADN tonight about location, going on the assumption the House wanted
        sp session held in Anchorage, by the way. My statements wont make any sense now that i see
        the House poll results.
