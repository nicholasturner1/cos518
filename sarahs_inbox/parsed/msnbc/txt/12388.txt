            Governor,



             omarrow is the deadline for budget amendment to--t   House Finance Committee.-- he--
            subcommittee reports are in and now is the typical time that the administration submits
            requests to the committee for reconsideration of problematic budget reductions.  Right now
            it looks like there was approximately $100 million reduced from our amended budget. This
            includes the $7 million for fish and game to replace federal funds, nearly $5 million for
            the BP corrosion lawsuit, quite a bit out of health and social services and even the
            university.



            I wanted to run a strategy by you.         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

              Governor / Commissioner Von Scheben:

              The Governor's Office received a letter from the Mayor of F.agle and 4 of the 6 city council members. (Attached) The letter
              reaffirms their support for the road improvements which includes the dust control work. The letter also says the Council has
              polled and found a majority of the residents of Eagle are in favor of the going ahead with the project. The news coverage on
              the issue seems to have greatly exaggerated the level of opposition to the project.

              I believe the Denali Commission (which is funding 70-80% of the work) would like to go ahead with the project.

              Commissioner. Are there further steps to gauge local support that you would like DOT to take before moving ahead?

             Randy
