              Amen!



              Also- I went through all me " sent " emails - esp looking at anything I've recently sent to
              Todd. There's no "Tony Piper" cc'd anywhere on any emails.



              Todd- did you find the original email to check address of sender?

             Reminds me of that comment on the first KTOO/JNU debate...

              You know , we could start with breaking down the distribution list and

              re-building it. Like Kris and Frank said, I'm sure there are people on

              there who have been added at one time or another that whomever was

              adding the names probably didn ' t realize shouldn ' t be on the list.



              As far as the enemy among us, I say hang 'em up!

             Makes me sick to my stomach , as I know it does for you three also. Just

             wish we didn ' t have to spend so much time on this stuff - but we do be no

             one else seems to be too worried about it.

             It is too flippin' fishy and there just        seems to be too much of these

             fishy things happening.

             True, true . And no way to stop it - I was just thinking on the flt

             though it 's fishy again that things talked about internally end up

             blogged . Never ending mysteries there though. Sigh.

             Kris .. . did we know who rfn was?



             My understanding was that there were non - media types on that press

             release mailing list also.. .and that it was a compilation of a few media

             lists (sounded like a mess last year when I tried to find Juneau-only

             media.. .gave up and just built one myself).



             It'd be interesting to see what Sharon turns up. It ' d be very easy for

             a mole to get on that list...they probably just emailed and asked to get

             on it.

             Unless I'm mixing up bloggers here - here's my take on something fishy:

             There's a blogger named rfn. He started off as a big supporter, now he's

             a critic who picks and chooses what issues to support us on. This

             morning he posted the press release we sent out 4:45pm yesterday on

             Conoco"s response... and added that, essentially, I over-react and panic

             with responding via pressers -like it's a bad thing. How would this

             blogger have received the emailed presser unless he's a valid media

             person (and why would a legit media person bother to be a regular

             blogger?), or one of our folks sent it to him?



             Strange thing is yesterday it was one of our folks who, as he does so

             often, warned me I'd again look like I was over-reacting... and he did

             not want any pressers going out... He cautions often that it doesn't do

             any good and even though he say he agrees with me that we should be

             communicating more often and clearer with the public, he is very, very

             hesitant to ever want pressers or statements going out in response to

             timely issues.



             Trying to put two and two together here, trying to remember if this is

             the blogger who criticizes me but says very supportive things of a

             select few in the administration.
