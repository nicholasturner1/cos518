          Did you full up your days on Monday and Tuesday? If not, there are two gentlemen I
          suggest you meet with on electricity/power issues.



          Andy Warwick and Lance Parrish are involved with Doyon Utilities, which is taking over the
          power supply at the military bases (or at least the Army Posts).



          They have done some work on looking at using North Slope gas to generate power and send it
          to the Interior (and potentially beyond). I went over their numbers with them this
          afternoon and they would like to share them with you, too.



          They also want to discuss the GVEA/AIDEA situation. They are definitely not apologists
          for GVEA, but they have some ideas that aren't really on the table right now.



          These are a couple of really good guys. They were         very active in opposing the SGDA
          contract and are fairly supportive of our efforts         through AGIA. I have made sure they
          don't have designs on "participating." It appears         to me that they just want to make you
          aware of options for the mid-term that Steve H may         not be considering.



          If this is something you'd like to do, I can get their contact info to Janice and get
          something set up.
