                 Governor,

                 Just wanted you to be aware of what we were doing Friday when UAA releases phase 1 of the
                 Alaska Elections Security Project. I gave Kris P. and Mike T. a heads up yesterday on this.
                 Shouldn't be any bombshells. We're being proactive about ensuring elections security. Last
                 summer I asked the University to take an independent look at our elections technology and the
                 processes/procedures employed. UAA completed its initial look and will provide a more in
                 depth review in Phase II, across the next three months. My intent with the Division is to
                 implement recommendations in time for 2008 elections.

                 What UAA found in this first phase was to them, "...in many ways re-assuring: Alaska's system
                 has many features that improve security. Those include paper back ups for electronic counts,
                 cross checking of vote counts in different locations, and a centralized system for state and
                 federal elections throughout Alaska." (In other states, counties use their own patchwork of
                 different procedures.)

                 A number of vulnerabilities have also been identified.... For example, the scanners and touch
                 screens "sleep over" with election workers in remote locations because the machines are flown
                 in ahead of time to Bush villages. The Division has procedures for multiple people to check the
                 accuracy of the starting count (set to zero) before polling begins, paper copies of votes are
                 kept, and other procedures maintained to ensure the integrity of the process, but the University
                 will delve deeper into whether other layers of safeguards are needed. In Phase II, UAA will
                 continue to examine the technology (scanners/touch screens) used and make
                 recommendations for improving elections security.

               Governor, I just sent an email with an update for this event. Jenni Ragland, PR Director
               for Salvation Army will meet you at the entrance @ 2:00 p.m. They will have a designated
               spot for you blocked off. I just spoke w/Jenni and stated that you had approx. 30 min.
               for this event only. Janice
