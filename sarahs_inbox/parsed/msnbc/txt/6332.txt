         Hi Mike - the one committee I'm on (Nat Resources, which I'm trying to be elected as vice
         chair under Bill Richardson) doesnt meet until this afternoon, and unfortunately Security
         can't get a later flt to DC to allow me to attend the committee mtg this aft. I dont have
         to be at the Pentagon until tomorrow at 10am. Kris is tracking down Chairman Huntsman to
         explain that I tried to rearrange sched to get there anyway.



         Also, did u get the string of emails re: Nelchina herd? I didn't hear from you on it, but
         heard from Denby and Talis. I want to make sure all are on the same pg there, so want to
         make sure you received the emails I've sent on the court ruling.

        Hope you've having a good weekend. I'm already anxious to get back to AK as I feel like
        I'm missing out on too much. Sean sent a email re: Begich being "everywhere" and catering
        to those who are affected by our necessary budget vetos. I think I'll email him back and
        say I wish I could be in two places at once   there's no way I can get out and about as
        much as Mark does tho - and he has a smaller area he has to cover anyway.

           Governor - attached is a draft response to Bradner's article and the ADN regarding operating budget - I will work with Mike,
           Kris and Sharon to scale this down but I was trying to come up with something that we could use for a broader audience -
           Bradner's article did have some errors in terms of his comparisons from our fiscal summary but his overall premise is that we
           will need to cut more or run out of cash earlier.
