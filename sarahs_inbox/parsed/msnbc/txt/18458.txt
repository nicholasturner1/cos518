          Hi J;

          Sean needs an appt w/me in Anchorage on friday - how 'bout after the optom. mtgs that day?



          Also, i need to call in to a KFQD talk show tomorrow at 9:30 or 10am.



          If weather's bad, can natl guard and the blackhawk film their PSA in Anchorage sometime
          after my Juneau trip? Or do they want me to be in Juneau for the filming? Either way is
          fine. .but i heard weather might be too bad for them this time.
