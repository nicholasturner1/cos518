I am just enjoying the ride. Your statements and values are virtually unheard of in your line of
business. When did the culture of dishonesty creep into our most valued profession.

I hope nad pray that there are many others ready to suppport and stand as you are. Please we need
more of your standards and heart in our lives. Thank you for the continuous smile I have been
having. Good job.
