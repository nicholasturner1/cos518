MESSAGE:

Dear Governor and Mr. Palin:



Heartiest congratulations from PAXSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Best wishes for all concerned, and we hope you have the opportunity to come up here, if not during
the rest of our still-great snowmachine season, then anyway as early as possible. Maybe we can
baptize young Trig in Paxson Lake??????????



Very sincerely yours,



Audie
