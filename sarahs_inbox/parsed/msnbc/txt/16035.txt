          Dear Governor Palin:




                                                                1

          Governor Palin,

              I am a conservative from NY. I saw you on the Glenn Beck show and I

          was impressed with your views on domestic drilling.           When he asked you if

          you would accept the position of Vice President if it was offered to you,

          your response was probably not because there is so much you can still do

          for Alaska.     I say TAKE IT.       Senator McCain will probably only serve one

          term.    IF he does not pick a conservative VP I may not vote for the

          President.     I appreciate your loyalty to Alaska but I think you could help

          Alaska and the country as VP and would be the          presumptive nominee for

          President in either 4 or 8 years. Assuming he wins and if he doesnt, you

          get more national attention to run in 4        years as president yourself.        I

          honestly feel that this country is ready for a woman president .             Hillary

          Cinton was just the wrong woman.




          Sincerely,




          Patrick Vahey
