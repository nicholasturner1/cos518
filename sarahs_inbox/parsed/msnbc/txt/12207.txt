             Does it make sense to make that extra leg from DC to NY next week? If not, I'll head back
             from DC after the NGA. Thanks

              Although we didn't yet set an interview time, NY Times Magazine still interested in
             developing a story, even if it doesn't happen on this trip.



              Their process is similar to 60 Minutes - visit then consider moving forward. It wouldn't
             be a single interview and may take a little time to develop.

              B- did any new york interviews get set up ?       Before final cancellation of that leg of
             trip it'd be good to know possibilities.
