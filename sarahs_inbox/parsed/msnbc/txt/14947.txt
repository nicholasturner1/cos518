           This note is from my son Trevor. He met you when you visited Gastineau School and the
           Headstart Program. I also met you that day when I was covering phones in the office.



           Dear Ms. Palin,



           My name is Trevor Renee Daniels, I am    4 years old and goto Preschool. Can my class visit
           your house (the Governor Mansion ) and   have a playdate with your daughter? What do you do?
            (as Governor). Why do you work in the   big building? Does your daughter help you? I help my
           mommy at school. I want to be a pilot,   scubba diver, firefighter and construction person
           when I grow up. Thank you. Rebecca
