               Governor, I talked to John Katz this morning and he asked if you ever had the opportunity to mention anything to the
               President about supporting seismic work in ANWR?

                  I received a request from one of my friends at Sen . Stevens' office. Last week, our delegation and other key
                  senators sent a request to President Bush for an EO to mandate USGS conduct seismic surveys in the 1002
                  Area. Kevin Simpson phoned me and asked if the Governor could weigh in as well. Privileged or Personal
