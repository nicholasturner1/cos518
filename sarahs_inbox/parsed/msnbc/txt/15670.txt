             Governor,



            Here are your remarks and event info for the bill. signing (fishing/hunting licenses &
            Guard firefighters) on Monday morning at Ship Creek. I will have a binder prepared for
            you that morning for your convenience. I have not heard whether Senator Huggins has
            confirmed his attendance or not, and so I have worked him into the agenda and your
            remarks, just in case.



            Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or alteration requests with the
            remarks.  Thanks and have a great weekend!
