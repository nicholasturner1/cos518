              The board is interviewing today . The goal was then to provide to you, early this week, a
              list of three names with a strong recommendation for No . 1 and a name for No . 2 and No. 3.



              Thanks for asking .     I really want to see the energy coordinator go to work. Tom

              Tom- any idea when Pat Galvin and crew will have energy name ( s)            forwarded to me? Hopefully
              very soon we can put this one to bed.

              Amen !  Do u remember when they' re supposed to bring the suggested Czar name (s) forward?
              It's ridiculous to have to go through extra steps to make an appointment like this.

              That would be awesome.



              Hey on another note...I hear there's movement on your energy coordinator. You probably
              know more than I. but sounds like a fire was lit last week and Privile ed 's name may be
              forwarded.   I only hope he's still willing to serve. Waiting to see so ething official
              before I uncross my fingers. He's extremely well spoken of in Fbx. Added for what its
              worth, Jim Posey stopped by saying he'd be excellent for the state... said the only folks
              who don't like him are MEA but with that exception is respected across the board in the
              utility world.

                    And great to hear how well your daughter is doing! It 's amazing to think Isabella is
              already 7 months. That first year just zips by.



                    I think it would be spectacular if the gasline guys could work something out with
              you to tap into your awesome talent and work ethic. Working from home, your own hours,
              nothing more than part-time... it really could be accomodating to your schedule.



                    Kurt Gibson is proving to be a great spokesman for AGIA, Bruce is good too. Marty
              comes across well. They're pulling things together so well to get that needed national
              message out there... I get nervous about our local critics growing legs under their
              constant gripes about us, so I'd like to see a greater focus locally still - but AGIA guys
              also are aware of the need to get more national recognition and support for the gasline.
              Again, Kurt is a great spokesman for this. I know they all want to work with you - as do I
              (and the rest of the crew - Kris, Frank, et al).

                     If it works for you , we can make it work all the way around.



                    Thanks for your message Meg. It's great to hear you 're doing great.
