          M- Next time there must be communication with the affected parties - I'm reading your
          concerns about giving them too-long of a head ' s up, but I ' m not going through that again
          when we could squash at least some of the knee - jerk reaction from the citics on such an
          issue . Hope you agree because in hindsight we can see it could have been handled
          differently - and I shouldn ' t have assumed affected parties were contacted , I should have
          followed up to make sure . It was a good lesson anyway.

          Thanks

         I do not have anything more to add to what Katz' sent. The quick answer is that John made
         contact with the delegation and I assigned myself the job of contacting local legislators.
         We both worked quickly to cover our assignments once the release was approved but even on
         my end Kyle did not call me back until the afternoon. I never planned on talking to the
         delegation and I know John would have recomended against it anyway.

        Heard from larry and katz - they reiterate that they didnt tell D.C. until minutes
        afterwards - but still haven't heard from you or anyone else whom I thought had notified
        delegation staff.  ?

          Wow- i must have missed the fairbanks editorial that ran today in Juneau. Mike- if, as
          i've been told, the delgation and staff WAS informed of bridge cancellation, yet editorial
          claims otherwise to mislead the public, then please send a correction today to both
          newspapers. Had anyone caught that previously? Pls send the clairification asap. Thanks
