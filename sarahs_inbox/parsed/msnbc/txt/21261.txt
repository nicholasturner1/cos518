          Governor,



          in looking at tomorrow's agenda on-line for the Arctic Energy Summit, I see that it opens
          tomorrow at 9am with Governor Hickel speaking. You are expected to speak at 9:30 followed
          by Senator Murkowski.  You were scheduled via Janice from 9:30 to 9:55 but I wanted to
          give you a head's up on the opening should you decide to attend. I apologize as I should
          have looked at the conference agenda sooner. I will go over before the event to scope it
          and the lay-out and will meet you there. Bob said he could drive you from the Atwood and
          drop off as parking will be difficult.



          On another note, not sure if Sharon told you but Balash will be attending the editorial
          board with you.



          Kris
