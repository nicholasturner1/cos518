         To: Governor Sarah Palin

         From: Senator Ted Stevens

         Date: May 19, 2008



         Governor:



         My staff has passed on the outline of your proposed energy relief package. This is really
         a. significant proposal with balance and immediate effect.



         My congratulations for a timely and important plan.



         It would be my hope that some assistance would be provided to small commercial fishing
         permit holders who cannot afford to fill their tanks now without a loan. It would be
         deemed to be treated as a lien on the permit repayable in two years as an addition to
         state taxes. I feel without assistance a substantial number of small vessels will not
         fish this year.



         Hope to see you soon.



         Best wishes,



         Ted
                                                                  1

          Attached is a fax from Ted Stevens that we received yesterday regarding the Gov's energy
          plan.  It has been logged in as a CTS.
