            First, thank you for being willing to go to Kuwait and to support the soldiers there
            and elsewhere.

            I have an important, sensitive issue to discuss with you about APOC and would like
            to talk with you when you return. I am in Anchorage at my Atwood office through
            Saturday evening. I know you will be tired on your return and with the picnics one
            after another, so if this needs to wait until Monday or Tuesday that would be fine
            with me. It will require about 10 minutes of your time.
