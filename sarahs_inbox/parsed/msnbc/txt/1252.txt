MESSAGE:

Governor Palin,



You must receive thousands of emails, and this likely won't get very high billing on your priority list,
but in the off chance it does, here goes.



I want to add my congratulations to your family on the birth of your new little son. I was very touched
by your family statement announcing his birth and want to add my best wishes to you and your
family. As the mother of a child with challenges, I have learned priceless lessons and would not
trade one minute of being his mother for anything this world could offer! Your obvious faith will no
doubt sustain and strengthen your family. Rest assured- there is joy ahead! I just wanted you to
know that there are many families, many mothers who empathize and are pulling for you. God bless
you- as He already has by sending you a special son.



All my best,
                                                      1                               ROSTON 02236
