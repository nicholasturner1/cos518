  Yes, she knows Scott. Perhaps Todd could/should call him first (?)

  Subject : Telephone Call -

  The Governor received a phone call this a.m. from a Scott McCavit 907-373-3824 (Wasilla). He said he is
  a friend of the Governor's. He said something about second hand smoke and that it concerns Wasilla but
  would not give me anymore information, wants to talk w/Sarah directly.

  Do you know if this is a friend or not? Thanks, Janice
