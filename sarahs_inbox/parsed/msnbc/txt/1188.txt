regretted by email last week. Janice

MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin,



My name is Kim Mackey and I just heard on the news about your new son. I wish you all the joy and
happiness in the world with him. I know that you will be doing (or have already done) research on
Down Syndrome Children. My own son, Patrick, is a 17 year old young man with Down Syndrome
here in Valdez and he is currently a junior at Valdez High School. We have heard that you will be
speaking a graduation here in May and we hope to see you there.



I hope your new son brings you as much joy as Patrick has brought to our family.



regards , Kim Mackey
                                                 1                              ROSTON 02139
