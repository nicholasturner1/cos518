             Pretty darn good, eh? It's about as good as we could ask for right now.

                       Olson Comments on Palin's PPT
                                  Plan
                          Oil & Gas Committee First Referral in the House,
                           Chairman Looks Forward to Upcoming Debate
              (Soldotna) - Representative Kurt Olson (R-Soldotna) today said he and his staff
              are reviewing the work draft of the proposed changes to the Petroleum
              Production Tax (PPT) released Monday by Governor Sarah Palin.

              "I certainly appreciate all the time and effort Governor Palin and her staff have
              put into this work draft," Olson said. "Since we don't know whether this will be
              the version introduced on the first day of the upcoming special session , we will
              be reviewing the draft on a conceptual basis.

              "As Chair of the House Oil & Gas Committee, I have been working with the
              Administration since August and anticipate that we can maximize the return to
              the people of Alaska without killing the golden goose. If the final draft does not
              fix the inequities recently exploited by British Petroleum, passage of SB 80
              becomes critical."

              Senate Bill 80 is legislation crafted by Sen. Tom Wagoner (R-Kenai) to prevent
              BP PLC, and other producers from counting neglected or improper maintenance
              against their PPT tax credits.

              Olson is traveling out of state and will return prior to the Special Session.
