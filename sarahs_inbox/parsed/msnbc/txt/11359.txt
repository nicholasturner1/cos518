                Hi Governor,

                Rep. Lindsey Holmes was the lone nay vote.

                She had earlier offered an amendment to allow an exception for the
                health of the mother. Her argument was that consideration should be
                given in the event of a mother of five children whose health could be
                seriously jeopardized by the unborn sixth child to such an extent that
                she would be unable to care for her other children. The amendment was
                defeated with Rep. Holmes being the only yea vote. Arguments against the
                amendment varied but probably the most compelling was that a cesarean
                could be preformed in situations where the health of the mother was at
                risk and the unborn child would at least have a chance of survival.

                I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.
                -Mindy
