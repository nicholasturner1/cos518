           She should realize they were FUNDED for the most part - even mosyt of the small "cuts"
           weren't completely axed but reduced. The state's poured more $ into the public educ system
           than ever before- as she noted in an earlier press conf that in her 34 yrs she's never
           seen such an educ package! And she wasn't there to fight with Eddy and the crafters of the
           Educ Funding Plan for the higher BSA so one has to figure she was happy w what the state
           funded, incl capital budget items.

           I did talk to carol but I got an email from her saying she was stunned by how many school
           projects were actually cut. So she wants to talk with me about what she can do in the
           future. Karen

            I've gone through Sean's story. It is definitely misleading. Service High's turf. And
           Sharon, for another example, he mentions a cut of $1.1 m to Covenant House without stating
           they received $3.9...but he clarified that the recycling center rec'd $lm of their request
           for $2m. And, Karen talked w/Carol.

            Sharon we need adn to correct re: vetoing astro turf - we did fund at $d00 g the
           Anchorage requests . Not sure what else Sean missed - we should all look and he needs to
           correct what we find, hopefully. Thanks!

           Good point. I expect we will hear more about that. Hopefully the initial flap will die
          down after a couple of days. Karen

             For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
           capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or
           understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operating
           budget. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the
           process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
           her budget.



             Just my observations.
