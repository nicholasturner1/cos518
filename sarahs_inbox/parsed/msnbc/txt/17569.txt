        >After nearly tossing myself off the top of the Atwood , Andrew Halcro and I just completed
        a one - plus hour phone conversation - first , we spoke about the leak that he and the
        Governor discussed a job during the administration and perhaps his anti - AGIA rants are
        related to the fact that he didn ' t get the job . I reiterated the fact that this
        Administration had absolutely nothing to do with the leak ( in case anyone caught talk
        radio today ).   Secondly , I discussed aspects of the AGIA and expressed my disappointment
        in him that he did not take up the gasline team on the opportunity to have an

          informational meeting to ask questions and discuss the merits of AGIA . We ended the
          conversation quite cordially and now he would love to take us up on the original offer of
          meeting with the team regarding the AGIA and his concerns that we've not taken some things
          into consideration , especially in our cash modeling, etc. At this point, just filling
          everyone in, but would like to know what opportunities may exist for this conversation to
          take place.
