        Today a state court judge ruled against the State of Alaska on a portion of the
        application scoring regulations for the Nelchina (Unit 13) moose and caribou Tier II
        subsistence hunt permits.  Director Robus's summary below characterizes the judge's

          Subject : Short summary of judge's order re Unit 13 Tier II scoring



        This afternoon , Judge Jack Smith issued an injunction negating two aspects of the new
        Board of Game regulations ( adopted at the March 07 meeting ) controlling Tier II
        subsistence permit scoring for Unit 13.



        1)       The judge ruled that the income cap for Unit 13 Tier II applications was valid,
        but overturned the part of the reg that caused the whole application to be scored at "0"
        if a person received a "0" score for that question because their household exceeded the
        income cap .  Judge Smith stated that the person should be given the other points from
        other questions on the application.   This largely reinstates the importance of a person's
        answers to the "how many years have you hunted or eaten from this population " part of the
        application , which had made the Unit 13 hunts primarily longevity - based in the past. This
        was a feature that the BOG had expressly tried to change in writing the new regulation.
        The judge ordered the department to re - score the existing applicant pools for Unit 13 Tier
        II hunts using this approach .  We project that the effect of this will be to allow a net
        increase in the number of Anchorage area applicants to participate in the hunts.      The
        judge did not change the number of permits to be issued , so the increase in Anchorage
        hunters will take permits away from other communities .   Notably , the judge refused to rule
        on the other way an application can be zeroed out-if the questions regarding customary
        use of the Tier II population are scored " 0".   So he overturned one half of the pertinent
        regulation but not the other , leading to questions of fairness.

        2)       Judge Smith also ruled against the use of the superexclusivity part of the new
        regulation , which prohibited unit 13 Tier II permittees from hunting the same species
        elsewhere in the state during the same year .  Apparently he felt this was unfairly applied
        to only one game management unit in the state , although the BOG enacted the provision to
        try to persuade people without a strong personal Unit 13 hunting history not to apply for
        a Unit 13 subsistence hunt.

        The Division of Wildlife Conservation is working on re-scoring the existing applicant pool
        according to Judge Smith's order, and expects to be ready to publish the list and
        print/send permits out by the end of next week.

       In the meantime, DWC is publishing a news release (and has put onto our website) that
       tells the currently-published permittee list for Unit 13 Tier II permits that their
       permits are not valid pending resolution of the legal issues . We expect a large number of

            Perhaps Talis can add his point of view here as well.
