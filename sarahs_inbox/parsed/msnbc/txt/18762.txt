        I googled and found a Dittman poll for Murk in August 2006 referenced on Kyle's blog.

         Dave Dittman, the longtime Anchorage pollster who worked on Murkowski ' s campaign earlier
         in the race , finished a poll on the Republican primary last night.



         He says he surveyed people who are eligible to vote on the Republican ballot and voted in
         the party ' s primary in 2004 . ( Except for a fraction - 7 percent - who have registered
         since 2004 and say they'll vote Aug. 22).



         Dittman says he didn't conduct the poll for any particular candidate and that the sample
         size is about 500 people . His results are similar to the recent Rasmussen Reports numbers:



         Palin :   40 percent

         Binkley: 29 percent

         Murkowski :   17 percent



         Dittman writes : " Fourteen percent ( 14%) are still undecided with a week remaining before
         the election , however a demographic analysis of the undecided voters estimates that if the
         election were held today , Palin would receive 46%, Binkley 34% and Murkowski 20%.

             Sharon,

             Here is a draft of some possible language about resolution of the prisoner transport issue.

             Let me know if your folks would like to do a joint release and what additions /changes they would have.

             Thanks. Julie
