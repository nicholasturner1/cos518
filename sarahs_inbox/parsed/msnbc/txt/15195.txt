               Dear Governor Palin,

               Congratulations on your new arrival. You are such a beautiful woman. Alaska is lucky to have
               a woman, a smart one, and beautiful as well.

               I ask you, Governor to support the funding of the $1 million dollar Community Health Center grant as well as the
               $2.5 million for the health information technology network for the CHC's.

               I believe that Alaska should be doing GREAT with the oil prices being the highest in history.

               Your attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.

               Best Regards,
               Irene R. Roberts
