          Pat and Mike- in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd, I never heard that
          the pfd corp, had planned a dinner in fairbanks, and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



          It's embarrassing to think we planned an event "out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate, and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea, I would have been told?



          I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past, except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate, hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.



          If this was "hijackiing" it or it was out of line, surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
