           I have emailed Mr. Gillespie saying that we are able to send photo (I have some down
           here).  I will wait until he replies back confirming his mailing address. Thanks, Janice

           Janice,

           We usually send pictures, do you want me to bring a unsigned picture for her to sign for
           him??

           Well - I know the Governor Signs things for whoever asks - is there something in
           particular that he is asking for her to sign. I have not heard from him before - we
           always sign whatever they are asking...

           Janice, what do you think? Should I write him back and say no, or do you think the
           Governor would be willing to sign something for him?

           To Whom It May Concern,



           Hello . Can you tell me if the Governor signs authentic autographs through the mail? I've
           written several times through the mail and then tried email . I've either received no reply
           or a pre -printed autograph . Now I live in North Carolina and wondered if a NC address
           would have less chance of-receiving a reply. Should I try writing again? If so, please let
           me know . If genuine autographs aren't provided through the mail, I didn ' t want to keep
           wasting letters and stamps . Thanks for your time and your assistance . Keep up the good
           work . I hope to get back to my home state for a visit this year . Take care.




           Regards,



           Jim Gillespie
