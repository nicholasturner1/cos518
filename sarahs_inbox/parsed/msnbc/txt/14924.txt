          Dear Governor Palin,

          We saw an article about your new son Trig, and want to share some of our experiences
          raising Peder, our son who is now age 30.   Peder was born in Morgantown WV and had the
          benifit of good infant stimulation programs from the very beginning.   He now is a black
          diamond skier, a good water skier, biker, and weaver, among other things. He is the main
          weaver in our studio in Mullan where he makes rugs in the Finnish style that he learned at
          a studio in Finland.  He speaks some Finnish, enjoys travel and has lived in Russia, and
          travelled to many other eastern European countries, and he has a very good understanding
          of both geography and history. I will send some pictures if you would like to see some of
          his activities.  Just reply to this email.

          Best wishes and congratulations.

          Harley, Nancy and Peder Johansen
