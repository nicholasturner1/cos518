                         We are calling many right now to give a heads-up . I think an invitation is too formal as I am
                         telling reporters this will be a very informal sit around the table and talk gasline and receive
                         an advance on gasline state of the state . No cameras. Embargoed discussion . In one sense
                         don't know that we can expect it to be "off the record " as they will be using elements to
                         discuss the next day - embargoed is probably the important word . We have been
                         discussing teleconference availability though I am now leaning against it as we cannot
                         control if someone is recording somewhere else. Especially since every major outlet in the
                         state is covered with the above attendees.

                        Hello Meghan,

                        Welcome to Juneau!

                        I just wanted to touch bases on a couple of items for the Media Reception at the House on Tuesday,
                        January 16 from 6:30 to 8:30pm.

                         Guest List       25 (Media, GOA and Staff)
                         Would you email a guest list to me when you have a chance, even if it's not the final one.
                        Invites
                        How are you planning to invite this group? Is it going to be a simple phone call or do you need me
                        to generate a formal invitation? Another option is a phone call and follow up with a reminder
                        invitation that could be mailed out.
                        RSVPs
                        If you'd like them to RSVP to you that's great, please just keep me up to date on the responses. If
                        you'd like for me to take care of the RSVPs the phone number is 465-2599 and then I would keep
                        you up to date.
                        Menu
                        Horsedeuvres
                        Finger food desserts
                        Teleconference Call
                        You will set up the call and I will make sure that the phone is set-up. We'd need to decide in advance
                        which room is best suited for the call, so just let me know when you can stop by the House
                        (preferably this week).

                        I think that's it for now. Please let me know if there's anything that I can assist you with for this
                        reception or if you have any questions. I assume that you're my contact for this event, so please let
                        me know if there's someone else that I should be working with as well.

                        Thanks,
                        Erika
