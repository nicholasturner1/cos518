  No this doesn't cost us anything and these are the fun events that are like the dessert of scheduling. They are so glad
  to have you they take care of the details. Its just the working into the schedule part that we have to sort out!

  Thanks, all, for working on things like this that a lot of folks should have fun participating in. Just let me know when
  and where, and I'll show up.

  Shouldn't be much work on the state's part as these ball teams have been doing these ball nights forever and don't
  need our assistance - just approval to advertise who's "night at the ballpark" it is.

  The Bucs are another good and fun farm league team - they just happen to be based in Anch. And the Miners are the
  Valley.

  Didn't know the Bucs wanted us too - we'd do it for them also. I still want to know -Does it cost the state anything or
  is this basically used for their marketing? Its a good cause and I will be attending.

 OK -- JUST SO YOU KNOW THE BUCS TEAM HAS THE SAME REQUEST FOR THE SAME SORT OF
 EVENT. ARE THEY RIVAL TEAMS? I WAS GOING TO LAY OUT BOTH SCHEDULES TO SEE HOW
 THEY FIT INTO JUNE/JULY SCHEDULES FOR THE GOVERNOR. KART.

   Kari's welcome to plug this in to any convenient date that's open this summer. Don't know if I want to sponsor the camp be
  don't know the cost, so just plan on Game Night at the ballpark. Looks like the organizer's info is listed here, so it can be
  confirmed and rsvp'd ASAP between Kari and Kris and the Miners. Thanks!

   Greetings, Denise!



  Thanks for your e-mail.



  Kari has quite a balancing act to perform, but I'm sure she'll have an answer for you one of these days.



   With a little bit of luck, an opening will appear soon in the Governor' s amazingly hectic calendar ... and we'll ALL look
  forward to a Palin family trip to the ballpark and buying them some peanuts and Cracker Jack. Although, of course, we DO
  care that they DO come back.




  All the very best to you and Pete,



  Chris

  Hi Kari:


   Is there anyway we can work on a date soon.... I am kind of waiting to schedule the Governor Palin Day @ the Park before I
  finish the rest of the schedule so that we can give her as much flexibility as possible. I am available by cell @ 841-4589 or
  at home 746-4914 anytime.


                                                                                                               ROSTON 00211

  Kari,




   I spoke w/Denise Christopher w/the Mat-Su Miners this afternoon regarding their upcoming season. They are putting
  together a "Governor Palin Day at the Park" in June. I believe Rep. Stoltze is involved in this as well. They've kept several
  dates open and I suggested that she work directly with you on finalizing.



   Also, there's a Miners baseball clinic for Valley kids that the Mat-Su Delegation has sponsored in the past. If Governor
  Palin is interested in sponsoring the clinic it could coincide with the "Governor Palin Day at the Park" game. The kids get
  shirts and other things that say something like "Mat-Su Miners Baseball Clinic sponsored by Governor Palin."



  Denise is copied on this email.



  Kris
