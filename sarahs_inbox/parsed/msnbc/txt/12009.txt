             I wanted to let you know I am planning on attending today's meeting .  I know you / all can
             do great without me but I really support you and CP needs to see the group unified.



             I spent 2 1 / 2 hours with PA. Will update the team today.



             Also I have rescheduled with Sharon.       I am taking off tomorrow and will spend a quality
             day with her.



             Tell Todd we are cheering for him .         Thanks for letting me be part of you team.               God
             bless. Tom
