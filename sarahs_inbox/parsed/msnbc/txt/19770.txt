            John- what's been Stevens' position on AK building and E-W road to our resources? Probably
            a $2 billion project... And the first major rd built since the 70's. It's certainly
            something we want to do and would want to put some of our Fed Transportation formula funds
            towards.

               I just got off the phone with Meghan Stapleton. She is sending an addendum about the rural trips that
               mentions those trips we know occurred that she has been able to confirm . Do you want to see this before
               I send it on to Megan Holland? Or, as Meghan has suggested, can I send it in a new seperate e-mail to
               Megan?

               the City of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when the allegation/complaint came into the
               department the city removed Chuck from all supervisory duties . They made it quite sinister as you can
               expect like there is still something that he and the city was hiding.

                I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through this with
               me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney 's office and on the phone with the City of Kenai
               attorney's office working on a strategy.

               The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation . Its a human resource response
               when you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to sexual
               harassment, you remove immediately the person from the any of supervisory duties (in this situation
               Chuck directly supervised this woman ) until you can substantiate or unsubstantiated the claim. In this
               case they could not substantiate the claim and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.

               Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he can and
               set the record straight He will have the city Mayor by his side and she will attest to the situation in favor of
               Chuck Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
              Privile

              That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in the
              morning with some more follow up.

               My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a press conf to
               defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are
               any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.
                 He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good Alaskans say that this is
               NOT a good situation he's in.

              Governor - I can not verify the exact number of trips without looking at the whole scheduling file. I.can not get into
              the calendar system that we used prior to outlook without going into the office and looking through the hard copies.
              I will gladly go in to look through scheduling but this will take some time and that would probably not include the
              cabinet meetings, etc. Janice

              Most of the statement is in the there toward the bottom - I had switched the order of paragraphs to emphasize what was most
              important and that is the number of times that you've met with Walt. The main thing missing is a summary of your four trips
              seated together to rural Alaska and your days together in Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham. Also, we reworked the
              last statement re: AGIA.

              Below is what you approved Governor - for use tomorrow by anyone who needs to reiterate your points.

              Thanks,
              Meg


              First, regarding the number of meetings I ve had with Walt over the last year and a half, in addition to several face-to-face
              meetings, Walt and I spent
              much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate action.
              Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at events throughout the state, including four trips
              to rural Alaska seated together on the plane. During those trips to Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham, we also spent
              our days together. That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that I've
              personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four face-to-face meetings with me in 17 months to discuss public safety is
              untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with Walt, on my behalf, including meetings
              and conversations with fellow Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff; Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special
              Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a meeting, a phone call, or any type of
              conversation.


              Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware that he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment and
              retention. I would assume those plans are the same ones we discussed in those events and meetings, during Cabinet
              meetings, and on the plane, among other places. Those plans mirrored my thoughts and ideas to get more troopers and tackle
              the alcohol problem. That's why the ideas remain behind Kopp - only I expect immediate action in this new direction, not
              just another reminder of our plans. Regarding the draft 2007 annual report. My staff has advised that a copy of a lengthy
              draft report was provided by him for review by the special assistant and Chief-of-Staff. Again, though, I'm ready for results.
              And so are the people of this state.


              AGIA has been appropriately time consuming. AGIA is our firhue; the gasline is the financial security for the future of our
              state. The revenue from the gasline will pay for our essentials , including public safety. However, the time spent on AGIA
              over the last year and a half has not been to the detriment of ANY department or its missions ... and all the more reason to
              have high expectations that I have self-starters and results-oriented cabinet members.

               Per Rosanne and Sharon, this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland at the ADN.




               Former Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan Holland. My response to those
               questions follows:

               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment and
               retention. Like the legislature, I was focused and aware of a lack of results in recruiting and retention . Action and results,
               not words are the bottom line: For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the troopers with nearly I
               in 7 positions being unfilled . There were 56 vacancies as of June 30, 2008 . 1 was also aware that regardless of any plans of
     l         Mr. Monegan 's, no new positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were filled, which made it even more
               important to get the job done.

               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual report. I was aware of the draft and in fact , had several
               questions about it that Mr. Monegan never answered. My special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft.
               The fact that Mr. Monegan prepared a detailed draft written report of the troopers ' activities in 2007 does not change the
               bottom line or lack of results under Mr. Monegan.

               Mr. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him. This is wrong . In addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt
               and I spent much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety , and my desire for immediate
               action. Remember that Walt and I had many oppornmities , dozens of discussions at events throughout the state, including
               one-on-one time together on the state's plane traveling to the bush . That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every
               reception, other trips, and phone calls that I personally had with Walt . To suggest that he had four opportunities with me in
               17 months to discuss public safety is untruthful. Also notable , are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with
               Walt on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow Commissioners, the Chief -of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-
               Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a
               meeting, a phone call, or any type of conversation.

               While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state 's business on all other fronts as well , and will
               continue to do so.

               Thank you. Best if has mayor porter and manager koch with him. He MUST be candid, honest
               and must ask to be held accountable because he has nothing to hide as he tells truthfully of the
               situation... is my opinion based on what I've been told. I have no reason to NOT believe him
               based on info I am aware of... now Alaskans need to hear clearly why he is to be believed. Solid
               and strong and truthful. (I hope he realizes how bad some folks want to crucify us - he needs to
               be strong. )

              Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at public safety.

              It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a memo from the City
              of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when the allegation/complaint came into the department the
              city removed Chuck from all supervisory duties. They made it quite sinister as you can expect like there is still
              something that he and the city was hiding.

              I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through this with me.
              Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on the phone with the City of Kenai attorney's office
              working on a strategy.

              The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human resource response when you
              have any allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to sexual harassment, you
              remove immediately the person from the any of supervisory duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this
              woman) until you can substantiate or unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the claim
              and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.

              Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he can and set the
              record straight. He will have the city Ma or by his side and she will attest to the situation in favor of Chuck. Privil
              Privile ed or Personal Material Redacted
             P Yi e e
              That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in the morning with
              some more follow up.

              My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a press conf to
              defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are
              any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.
               He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good Alaskans say that this is
              NOT a good situation he's in.

              Governor:

              Here is the language from Meghan that I would send in a new seperate e-mail to Megan Holland.

              Randy

              Megan,

              Thanks for taking the Governor 's call and for reading these emails . I know that reporters on
              certain beats can amend stories late into the night In some cases. And while I know that it's very
              late and not an Ideal situation, any opportunity that you can provide for the Governor 's facts to
              come out, that would be great . As you know, situations like the trips are documented by the state
              and cannot be denied.

              With that in mind, the Governor wanted me to make sure that she also added a comment about
              her trips to rural communities with Walt. And so she asked that I pass along to you as well,
              following your phone conversation with her.


              Regarding trips:
              "Wait and I had many discussions regarding public safety, including during separate trips to rural
              Alaska seated together on the plane. More specifically, we also spent our days together during
              our two visits to New Stu in January and June of 2007 and during our trip to Bethel in January of
              2008. And that's in addition to other meetings that I mentioned such as face -to-face meetings,
              cabinet meetings, receptions throughout the state , and phone calls, among other things."

              And one more thought regarding AGIA:
              "AGIA has been appropriately time consuming . AGIA is our future ; the gasline Is the financial
              security for the future of our state . The revenue from the gasline will help pay for our essentials,
              including public safety . However, the time spent on AGIA over the last year and a half has not
              been to the detriment of ANY department or its missions... and all the more reason to have high
              expectations that I have self-starters and results -oriented cabinet members."



              Thanks, Megan.
