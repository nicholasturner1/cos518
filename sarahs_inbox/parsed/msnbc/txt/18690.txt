          Governor, Newsweek and Sharon land at 9:40 a.m. today. They should be to the office by
          approximately 10:30.  I will reconfirm with Sharon.  Thanks, Janice

        What time is the AO signing on Climate Change today? We'll need to let AP and other
        outlets know so Quinn can be there - there are lots of Alaskans waiting to hear what we're
        doing on Climate... this is a very good visual and public "first step" they've been
        waiting for. We know we've been working on it, but Alaskans don't know that yet. Thanks
