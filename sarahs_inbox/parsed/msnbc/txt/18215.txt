         Governor:



         I just got off the phone with Mike. He's having some technical difficulties with his
         Blackberry and can't seem to send messages right now--but he is still receiving them.
         He's delayed in traffic but will be there soon to discuss this further.

         Yes, Joe Balash did forward a request about a mat-maid. meeting for sometime after the
         board met on june 6 ..... I ran it by Mike Tibbles and Mike requested we stand by until we
         learned what the board decided on june 6. I did not receive any further information on
         mat-maid before I left on june 8.

         Does anyone have any notice of the Teamsters trying to meet with me two wks ago? This is
         a very significant issue and hopefully the request didn't get lost between the cracks, but
         right now just need to know if they did request a mtg two wks ago. Thanks

         Joe:

         Thanks for your response .        Based on what you have shared, scheduling the

         meeting after that date is probably an excellent idea.



         We are dealing with some pretty concerned employees who are right now

         looking for answers and direction.         Although we don't believe they are

                                                                3




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01 _0002476

         the only ones concerned, just the ones we hear from regularly.



         Thanks again.

         Barbara:



         I can assure you that MatMaid is getting the attention of the

         Governor.     My understanding is that the 600.0 goes through DNR--and

         the leadership of the department is expecting a plan for the funds

         before they are transferred. The Creamery Corp. and BAC asked for the

         funds and now they are being asked what they intend to do with it.



         I've not been briefed about the upcoming meeting so I'm not aware of

         the options that Van Treek plans to put on the table. I had

         understood there would be multiple options for the board to consider.



         I will forward your request to the scheduling office and see what can

         be done--would it be better to wait until after the meeting on the 6th

         so we see what has been put on the table?



         Joe
