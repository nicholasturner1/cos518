              I need to talk to you about. this. I'm hearing very disturbing theories on COS's
              participation in this. Pls track down the sender of the email as soon as IT guys can do
              this.

             Mike- we need to find out asap who leaked the email yesterday- hate to see you or anyone
             else being accused of purposefully setting me up with it being leaked, but that's what I'm
             hearing. I'll put that to rest when it's revealed who leaked it.
