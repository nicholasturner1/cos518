          Dave Donaldson with APRN contacted Adrian Herrara at Arctic Power . He was interested in
          doing a "correction" story about G. Gordon Liddy/ Arctic Power funds . Apparently, Adrian
          was very rude to him and refused comment . I realize that Liddy has canceled the trip -
          this is just an FYI.
