              MESSAGE:

              I keep reading good things about your administration. Finally a republican willing to
              slash the wrists of those with their greedy little fingers in too many people's pies!



              I'm college educated, and I do not vote any more because I feel so detached from
              government today that I feel I'm choosing the least of two evils at worst, and at best
              another politician that does not care about the sacred trust given to them to guard the
              interests of the people before the interests of big business, special interests, and
              praying before the God of the politically correct.



              Thank you
