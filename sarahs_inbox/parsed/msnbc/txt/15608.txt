           Governor - Mike Nizich and Commissioner Lloyd will be in the office at approx. 10:15 a.m.
           They would like to meet with you for approx. 10/15 min. on Polar Bears. They will then be
           accompanying you in the Clem Tillion meeting. I thought doing this at 10:15/10:20 may
           work as you are pretty much booked the rest of today. Thanks, Janice
