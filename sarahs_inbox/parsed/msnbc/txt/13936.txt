              We need to wrap up supplemental decision so I can follow through on my committment to give
              lawmakers plenty of time to figure out how to plug their vetoed projects into capital
              budget. Today's my last day mtg with them- we need to act tonight or tomorrow. And
              press/Alaskans need to hear a powerful message , via seeing Mike's list, of how screwy this
              has gotten under Bert. We need to be adament about this.

             Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill

             McAllister, Stephen M., Kristina?? On the second floor about the capital

             budget - told them there are significant items missing that are basic

             health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some examples

             like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big

             differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED

             grants - approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly

             there has to be a responsible budget by the end and that we will

             continue to work toward that.



             They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental -

             told them we still have a few more meetings with legislators - that I

             didn't think we would be able to do much before Thursday -

             We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't

             let their issues go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are

             working on it.

             Governor-



             I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

             could cover budget items as well as CON.

             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list

             that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

             screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

             to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

             outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
