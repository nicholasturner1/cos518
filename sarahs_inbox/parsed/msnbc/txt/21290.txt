              Who do I work with to get access to "input" on the calander? I hate to keep bugging
              others about my sched. I'm happy to do the inputting myself so nothing falls between the
              cracks... Just need to know how I get access to allow me to start inputting these events
              and appts for the official record.

              You speak at 10:00 am at the Sheraton. Harris is at 11:30 and McBride at 1:30. These
              latter meetings came up yesterday afternoon when Janice was out so we'll get them added
              today. She'll be here this morning.

              K-pls provide Janice today's sched for the record- principal's speech, mcBride mtg, harris
              mtg, etc.



              Also, i still need to see any tentative events/invitations so i can start picking and
              choosing what I can attend, to allow me plenty of time to prepare for events, esp the
              speeches . Thanks.
