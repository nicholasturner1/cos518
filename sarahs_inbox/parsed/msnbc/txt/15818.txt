           Message:Dear Governor Palin:



           As you consider the capital budget, we ask that the $250,000 for Arctic Power funding not
           be included.   The oil industry has almost unlimited resources to hire their own lobbyists
           and it seems wrong to bring Gordon Liddy, a convicted felon, to Alaska to advocate on the
           radio for drilling in the Arctic Refuge. It seems especially wasteful at this time as
           opening the Refuge is highly unlikely with the Democratic Congress and all three
           presidential candidates opposed.   Money could better be spent on education, health care,
           highway maintenance, revenue sharing, or put into a savings account. Thank you for you
           consideration.




           Mary and Jack Lentfer
