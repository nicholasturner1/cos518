             Yes - I will work with Ivy and folks on a solution to this. We can define distribution
             lists.  Janice

            I think Janice can refine our distribution list to make sure it only includes
            commissioners and Governor ' s staff-- any support staff for commissioners or Governor's
            staff should be removed . It narrows the scope of who could be leaking emails , and easiers
            for us to determine who's accountable.                                         -



            Also , we could bring up in cabinet meeting that only commissioners should have access to
            their personal state email accounts -- their secretaries should only have access to the
            general commissioner / department account.  Just some ideas...

            may be asking you to Track it down today - this was an internal email from steve to all
            commissioners . It ended up in reporters ' hands. Not good, again.
