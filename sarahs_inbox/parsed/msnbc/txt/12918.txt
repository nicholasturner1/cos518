            Thanks for advising us of your plans for Mr. = Liddy and the expanded coverage of Alaska
            energy issues that might ensue = from his trip.



            By copy of this email, I'm advising the = Governor's scheduling and press people of your
            tentative plans.  As = things progress, I would suggest that you add Janice Mason, the
            Governor's = scheduler, to your list.



            My guess is that Commissioner Irwin and his = people would be glad to provide a factual
            briefing for Mr. Liddy and his = staff.




            Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
            <mailto:jwkatz@alaskadc.org> jwkatz@alaskadc.org. = Thank you .

            Hi John and Larry,




            Well after a long time waiting I have finally gotten the go ahead = yesterday from Radio
            America to announce the Gordon Liddy trip to Alaska. = We have decided on July 11th
            arrival to July 20th. 7 full days = on the ground with 5 full broadcast days. Liddy will
            fly up to = Katovik on July 12 from Anchorage and visit Prudhoe, Barrow, and Red Dog = for
            a day each before heading back to Anchorage on the 16th. We will = broadcast live from
            Anchorage from 6am -10am on Wednesday the 16 to Friday = the 18th. The beginning of the
            week shows on Monday and Tuesday = (14th, 15th) will be prerecorded and done partly
            remotely from the = Slope .... we hope!



            Arctic Power will spear head the logistics of this trip but we are = also expecting the
            following groups to be helping out as well: North = Slope Borough, RDC, Alaska Chamber,
            The Alliance, possibly BP???please = please, NANA, DrVen, CH2MHi11, Village of Kaktovik
             More are = expected to join in as the word is put out.




            At the moment we are planning to deal with ANWR for a day, Alaskan = oil and gas for a
            day, mining for a day, Natives for a day, Alaskan energy = in general for a day. This is
            not set in stone and due to the early = stages of planning I expect everything to be
            subject to changes as = different groups want their message aired.




            We would really like the Governor to participate as the key guest on = the show for an
            extended live interview.  She can call in or be - present as is convenient. I have also
            asked Senator = Murkowski and will be putting the same to Young and Stevens. The = Mayors
            of Kaktovik, Barrow and possibly Kotzebue and Anchorge will be = formally asked.




           We are working to tie into Rush Limbaugh on one of the days but that = is uncertain at the
           moment.




           At any rate I think it will be good press for us and help with the = cause. Liddy
           broadcasts to about 500 stations nationwide daily and = so its pretty good size audience.




           all the best,




                                                         2




                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0013432
