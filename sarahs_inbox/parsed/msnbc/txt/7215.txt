       We need to find your Deputy in Anchorage. There's room in the Anch office to squeeze
       someone in and it will help us spread the news we need to re: bd vacancies. Kris agrees
       w/this and can help seek that good individual for you! They can also help you make sure
       our bds are staying on track with positive agendas.
