                         Governor Palin Releases Statement on Cowdery Indictment

            July 10, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska -Governor Sarah Plain today released the following
            statement regarding the indictment against state Senator John Cowdery:

            "It was disturbing to learn that another public official has been charged with violating the
            public trust. I urge Senator Cowdery to step down for the good of the state.

            "Today's news is a good reminder that we must continue to be vigilant in defending Alaska's
            sovereignty against those who would undermine it in an attempt to sell out Alaskans. As we
            move forward, let me remind everyone that this administration is committed to putting
            Alaskans and their interests first, as we develop our resources in a responsible and ethical
            manner.

            "We are on the right path. I am confident that path will be made more clear and obstacle-
            free as justice prevails in the ongoing FBI Investigation. Like many Alaskans, I look forward
            to closure on this disturbing chapter in our state's history."

            Denby must be talking to folks about this up coming vacancy.
            I had a visit from the Alaska Outdoor Council reps this morning they are 100 % in favor of bring someone
            new from the outside into the Deputy Commissioner position at F &G and applaud you for thinking this
   i
            way. They are slightly concerned about Cory if he is the choice but also indicated that they could work
            with him because he has the same goal in mind as they do as an organization . They would hope that
            Cory, if chosen for the job, would establish a rapport with them as soon as he came on board to get a
            dialog going . They were excited about the prospect of turn the ship around at the department and (their
            words) " It would be great to finally have someone at F&G that can manage the resource and not the
            people'. They also indicated that having some turn over within the department is not a bad thing and look
            forward to that happening . They stated that maybe we can finally bring in some new young talented
            biologist's from our state and other western states to help turn things around.
            They liked my idea about changing the name of Division of Wildlife Management back to the Division of
            Game.

            Hope you are having a good day.

          Hopefully we can provide information in being proactive to show what other Governor's
          travel has been and w/family. Remember that story not long ago that compared and showed
          the large difference between Palin and Murkowski? This is so ridiculus. We're talking
          about a Governor who had the state buy tickets on hotwire saving hundreds of dollars
          rather than just going w/the norm (much more expensive) or the fact that she often drives
          to the Peninsula or Fairbanks or the fact that her family rarely travels w/her when most
          of the invitations are for first family. Not to mention the majority of the time she flies
          commercial (and not first class!!)

          Remind him of the family travels w me that I have personally pd for, including with
          mileage. Hopefully our records very clearly show that. Also, my return of every per diem
          offer for everything related to the kids...and we need to be proactive in this issue with
          reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage apartment ... no
          chef... security down from 7 to 2, whatever- I'm sorry you have to deal w this w the FOIA
          even , I know I'm tired of it already. It is important to know though that probably a week
          doesn't go by without me asking if all the rules are being followed, if the Palin family
          is doing everything right with our travel, etc as First Family.

          Another significant thing here, to me anyway , was the exclusion of my 17-yr old son (now
          19) from all but two First Family events (he traveled to Juneau twice is all in these two
          yrs and I think I ended up paying for one of the trips myself ), I was told it was because
          he wasn't going to school in Juneau, which never made much sense to me but I didn't argue
          the fact he is a member of the family too.

          Pls show the travels of the previous Govs so he can compare- incl the fact previous Govs
          took family vacations WITH our security guys so they could take advantage of their rental
          cars, etc (this is according to Bob and Gary), compare that to me never having done this.

          We have to be proactive on this so pls let me know if you need any further info.

          Governor-


    i


          Linda Perez and I both spoke with Kyle today. He has filed a public records request for
          all of your travel and your family's travel .   He is really digging into the travel regs.
          He wants to know where it is spelled out where /when a family member can travel . I told him
          AGAIN that there is a certain expectation that the First Family make public appearances
          and participate in community activities as part of protocol .   I am blue in the face with
          this guy!  I told him that the Governor receives on average 200 requests each month and
          more than half extend the invitation to the First Family. I also reminded him that you
          prefer to travel by car and the kids aren ' t always with you. Somehow I don ' t think that
          will make it in the paper.

               I just spoke with Mr. Nizich after I forwarded this to him. Hesaid I should go
         ahead and let you know directly . He says your office has also received phone inquiries on
         travel in the last 24 hours from the ADN as well. This is just to give you a fuller
         picture of what may be happening in the news world. Talis

         Subject: Phone Call from ADN Reporter Kyle Hopkins re travel for governor ' s family

         Importance: High



         CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE



         I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially
         was looking for a copy of the 2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft. He
         had located the opinion online just as I called back. He then said he was looking into
         the question of when a governor ' s family could travel at state expense and asked whether
         there was any other opinion on this issue .   I advised generally that a family member might
         travel at state expense if the member was to attend an official function ( he said for
         example the inauguration ), and that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this
         point.




                                                              3




                                                                                                          P RA_G S P01 _0020583
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com        Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




         He then wanted to know whether there was a statute, regulation or other guidance defining
         what would be an official function or state business. I advised that I was not aware of
         any.  It would likely depend on the circumstance and the involved official's authority.
         He also asked who would decide and I suggested again it would likely be addressed in the
         circumstances on a case by case basis by the governor's office.



         He did not say or suggest whether he is looking at the question with respect to Governor
         Palin or a former governor.
