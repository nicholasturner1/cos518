            We can't "possibly" have the relase of a "draft" next week... we have to PRODUCE. It's been
            promised and understood that 1st it was going to be a month out that we had the bill... then it was
            Oct 1 we'd have the actual legislation... what am I missing here? The deal was we'd travel the
            state to have hearings on it... and we got all over Leg leadership for not sounding enthused about
            them also traveling the state with town hall meetings on the legislation... was any deadline
            pushed back?

              Below you' ll see Pat's most recent message.
              I believe the goal is still to have the releasable draft ready for next week, if possible.

              Mike,

              I will be briefing you and the Governor on the final issues with the bill shortly.
              We're completing it with the working groups (admin, econ) this week.

               The ACES special session is right around the corner. Based on the success of
               the AGIA team, I've decided to utilize a large strategy team approach, that will
               be broken down into smaller teams to accomplish particular tasks or pursue
               special inquiries.

               I'd like to invite each of you to join the ACES strategy group. My current idea
               is to have the strategy team meet at least once a week up until session to
               compare notes and brainstorm necessary actions to maximize our chances of
               success.

               I'd like to hold the first meeting this Wednesday, the 26th, from 1-3. I'm in
               Fairbanks all week, so we'll do this by teleconference.

              Those in Anchorage can meet up in Suite 1820. The rest of us will dial in. I'll
              distribute an agenda and teleconference info late Monday evening.

              Please let me know if you can join us. Thanks.

              -Pat
