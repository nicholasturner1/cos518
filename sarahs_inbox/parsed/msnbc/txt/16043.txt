                 Subject: Kyle Hopkins / KABATA document

               Governor.

               I spoke with Kyle. He was able to get a copy of the document from KABATA in Anchorage . He is considering a
               follow up story in the next several days based on some of the statements in the document , such as estimated
               costs for the project, risks to the state, etc.

               I will work with DOT to try and set up a meeting with KABATA for them to brief us on their new approach to the
               project.
