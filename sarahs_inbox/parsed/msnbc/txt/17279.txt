             Subject: Parnell 's visit to DC
             Sean's headed out the door to DC and still needs AGIA info for his follow up meetings - if you
             could send him additional info his address is sr parnell(a,gov.state.ak.us.

             He'd appreciate anything and everything we could provide him as he attends his Lt. Gov conf.
             and meets with our delegation and others in DC.

             Thanks!
