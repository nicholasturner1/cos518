            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Sarah Palin,




            I just wanted to say Thank You for inviting us to your home on February 4th for the Alaska
            Head Start Association . For many of us, this was a once in a life time event, one that
            I'll never forget. It was such an honor going to your home and sharing my story with you.



           Thank you for taking the time to listening to our wonderful stories. There are so many
           more success stories like mine. Kenaitze Head Start has helped my children and family with
           so many postive things. Our family has been involved with the Kenaitze Head Start program
           for about 10 years now. They are like my extented family now. They are not only there for
           our chilren, but for us parents too. Like I said before... Your child is not only being
           enrolled in Head Start, the Whole Family is being enrolled. It should be called Family
           Head Start.



           Thank you again,

           Sandra Wilson, '

           Proud parent of Head Start Students
