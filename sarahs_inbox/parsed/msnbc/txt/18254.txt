          Dear Mr. and Ms. Summers:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

                Thank you for vetoing all the pet projects in this year's budget. I can't believe
           that we still budget by "giving" each legislator $1 million + to spend on whatever they
           want. My wife and I agree with you- State budget should be Constitutionally MANDATED items
           only. We're so proud of you for standing up to Juneau, even to those within your own
           party. We were always Republicans until we moved to AK back in 1982. Your moves to bring
           back responsible & ethical government are ALMOST enough to make us want to switch parties.
           BUT, until all the Vic's, Randy's, Scott's (OK, he's finally gone) , Lyda's and Ben's are
           gone, we're staying Independent. But please be sure, we're 2 Independents who voted for
           you & are behind you 100%. Thanks again. Jim & Kathy Summers (retired Mat-Su educators
           who worked with your Mom & Dad, Chuck & Sally)
