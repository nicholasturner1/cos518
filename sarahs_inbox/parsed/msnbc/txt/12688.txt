            Pls remind Julia Omalley that "they " said the same thing throughout my career- "too
            young", "pregnant", "kids"... "She won't be able to do it"... This coming from good of
            boys who don't like change... And so far along in my career we 've proved them wrong at
            each turn.

            By the end of her term, Swift was extremely unpopular with voters in the state (at one
            point having the dubious honor of a single-digit approval rating). This unpopularity was
            due in part to a perceived lack of effectiveness and in part to apparent abuses of her
            gubernatorial privileges, including: her use of a Massachusetts State Police helicopter to
            commute cross-state, from Boston to her home in North Adams; and, the use of State House
            aides to babysit her children.

            Massachusetts does not have a Governor' s Mansion . However, during the Swift
            Administration, it was given serious consideration. For security reasons after 9/11, Swift
            was driven daily to the state capital, spending up to six hours commuting as profiled on
            CBS's 60 Minutes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes> . She'rode in a van which had
            been converted into a mobile office.

            In 2001, her poll numbers sinking during a political campaign, she vetoed
            <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto> a unanimous ruling by the Board of Appeals for the
            commutation of the sentence of Gerald Amirault, who was serving a 30 to 40 year sentence
            for molesting children at a pre-school based on suspicious evidence (recovered memories)
            from young children. As a result, Mr. Amirault spent three more years in prison (18 years
            in all). Regarding Gov. Swift's refusal to allow Amirault's release, on February 21, 2002,
            the Wall Street Journal, in its lead editorial wrote, "[Governer Swift] joins the long
            line of the ambitious and the self-seeking, prosecutors and politicians, who chose
            expediency over justice."
