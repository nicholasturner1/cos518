           Governor Palin,

           I think I had mentioned before the possibility of organizing a reception in Anchorage for your appointments. I've
           coordinated with Kris and Karl and it looks like June 29 would work as you 'll be in Southcentral for a Miner's game
           and a Bucs game, and some other events . If you ' re interested in this, Kris and I could start working out the
           details . If you ' re not, that's okay too.

           We had thought each Palin appointment (approximately 75) and 1 guest could join us for an informal reception
           where we could hear what's going on the boards, put a face to a name in some cases, and to keep the
           appointments motivated to continue serving.

           Who: Palin appointments and I guest
           What: informal reception , short welcome speech , and then meet and greet/visting
           When: June 29 for 1 hour
           Where: Anchorage (location TBA, Kris had mentioned the AK Native Heritage bldg)
           Why: meet appointments , keep them inspired and willing to serve
