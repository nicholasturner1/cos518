             For some reason Thomas doesn 't want us to retro back the tax change. So he voted no on 25.
             Hope he' s a Yes at the end of the day.



             We hear Hawker really wants to ball this up by now supoorting only a gross! And of course
             the senate may be a cluster...

             Lots of folks who supported you did not like Neuman. I fail to remember why, but i just
      I
             remember how folks were freaking out about him posting his signs next to yours post-
             primary saying he was trying to get a boost on your coattails.



             Guess it was cool to side with.you when it worked in his favor.

              Mark Nueman was one of only 14 house members just voting NO on 25k. Along with Samuels and
              Johnson and Hawker and crew. Sheeeesh...
