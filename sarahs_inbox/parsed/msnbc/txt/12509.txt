            Ideally we'd have leg work underway to find a venue so we take away any argument there

           This makes financial sense.  We can come up with a venue that works just fine, and the
           public can participate much better in the process. AGIA is the future of the State's
           economy and public access to the process is critical.

            finish up in 90 days , but if we have to hold them or call special session to consider AGIA
            then we have to strategize with gasline team on timing of such.



           We were the nice guys last year on location of special session and " suggested " special
           session take place in Anchorage , this time it's obvious they desire more direction so I'll
           be calling it in Anchorage. It's nonsensicle to ask Revenue , DNR, Oil and Gas, Law, press,
           public, etc to fly to Juneau to take care of AGIA this go 'round. It'll be taken care of
           on the more convenient road system.



           So, if asked , that's my answer - but I do understand we may want to strategize on
           announcing those intentions. Thankst
