              Yikes, still. Embarrassing. I'll pretend like I don't remember that episode...



              They can use the photo and I'll close my eyes.

               You're holding a bouquet of flowers, wearing the crown, and a red dress. It was featured
               in your biography by Kaylene Johnson. It's a nice photo:)

              Governor,




              You will soon be taping a video for the opening of the Miss Alaska (America) pageant (the
              pageant will take place July 19 in Anchorage). Bonnie Faulk has requested that the picture
              of you as Miss Wasilla appear during the opening video; she feels it will be very
              encouraging to the girls and solidify the message that they can accomplish anything they
              put their minds to. Please let me know if you are comfortable with the photo appearing in
              the video (Jason and Andy would manage it, so it would not be released to the pageant
              itself but would be contained in the video).



              I will wait for your approval before contacting your sister, Molly, for the photo (your
              mother's suggestion) - thank you!
