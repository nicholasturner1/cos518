                  I am resending this. The last one bounced back with an error.

                  I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State. I wanted to get you something for the
                  2008 speech before the end of 2007. Anyway, let me know if you think it is on the right track.

                  I thought I would take a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow . On Wednesday , I thought I
                  would have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry Persily help me fact check and test
                  sensitivity and direction . There are some items in the draft that have not been made public yet. Two
                  examples are Habitat and Health Care reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out.

                  Last year's speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long. I tried to keep it shorter this time. This draft
                  is now 3800 words, hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was shooting for.

                  Happy New Year!

                  Mike
