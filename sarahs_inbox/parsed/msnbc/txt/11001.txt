              We have the meetings starting at 10 am. The pebble issues will go first and then others
              will join by 10:30. Janice was notifying everyone today, including Leo.



              Hope all went well in Bethel.

              Governor;

              I suggest Leo DOT be there also. He is on the AIDEA board and interested in the AEA
              decision.

              Thanks, Emil

              I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in the
              room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
              streamlined agencies , etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
              understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
