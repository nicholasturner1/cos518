              Subject: Greenland Invitation


            We were visited this morning by a high level delegation from Greenland. Citing
            many common issues with Alaska, they asked me to convey their invitation that you
            visit Greenland.

            The delegation tendered similar invitations to the Alaska Congressional delegation.
            The Greenlanders are in DC to inaugurate a weekly flight between the US and
            Greenland.

             Greenland is interested in pursuing such issues as climate change, telemedicine,
             advanced telecommunications, and oil and gas development. They discussed some
             of the current effects of climate change which are similar to what Alaska is
             experiencing.

            They also requested Alaska's participation in a joint committee currently composed
            of the US, Denmark, and Greenland. I mentioned our participation in the Arctic
            Council process, which also involves Denmark and Greenland.
