               I was thinking Mike had the foresight to plan for the possiblity that someone would leak since he signed the letter
               to a large group like that. Again , that doesn 't mean he planned it-rather, he might have planned for and protected
               against the possibility as best he could with a clear, positive message like what went out. Am I just being naive?

               My two cents...the email looks like it was written with the possibility of disclosure in mind. It's very clean, communicates the
               message well that fits with who you are, but is also good for public consumption. That doesn't mean you did it, or even that
               he intended it that way-just that he took precautions knowing disclosure was possible. How's that for believing the best of
               someone?

               Dan Fagan is talking about this ...a letter being leaked from the Governor's office. I'm just not sure if he is talking about the
               leak to ADN or if it was also leaked to him too.
