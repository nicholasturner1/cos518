             Dear Governor Palin,

                     Governor Hickel has arranged to bring a group of people to my office on Wednesday
             to discuss his hopes for a law school in Alaska. I know you had asked me about this
             before.   Have you taken a position on this?   Please let me know. Thanks Talis
