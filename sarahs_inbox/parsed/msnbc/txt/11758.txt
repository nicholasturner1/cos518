              Yes, but I'd want to do this solo, not with technical gas folks. Solo.

             Governor:



             If we can make it work in your schedule, would you be interested in an interview with The
             New York Times Magazine when you travel to NY with Commissioner Galvin for the bond-rating
             meetings?



             They have expressed real interest if we can make the schedule work.



             This is the one that we couldn't make work in October. I've pitched it as an Alaska / oil
             and gas / Palin story.
