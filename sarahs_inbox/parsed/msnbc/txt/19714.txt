               Thanks - I did just receive emails on the claim Walt is making. I will have to go back into the office as we had two
               different sets of calendars that were used and would not have them on my laptop. Also, would lice to have Tibbles
               calendar back to go through for these meetings also. I don't know if those folks are available tonight. Janice

               Governor - I just found a baby jogger for you and Trig. I will pick up this evening and bring in to the office in the morning -
               or would you like it dropped off at the house? Janice

               May I find a borrowed baby jogger for tomorrow's photo shoot- know anyone who'd have one handy?
