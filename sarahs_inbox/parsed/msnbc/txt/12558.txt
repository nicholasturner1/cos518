            I'm reducing Security positions (did you know Hammond fired all security! That's cool. He
            only used troopers for big events,. and he'd just call them and give them a head's up,
            telling them where he'd be. That saves at least a quarter million dollars. It was Knowles
            (who didn't drive) and Murkowski who built up that over-sized Security dept). By reducing
            their numbers but keeping the dollars in the budget and shifting them to Comm positions
            we'll hit our priorities better.
