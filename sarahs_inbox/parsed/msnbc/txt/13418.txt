                   Just an FYI, this is what DOC sent, per my request, to Sen. Wielechowski regarding the latest media reports. Bill had
                   inquired about these two issues and asked for 'the other side of the story.' I suspect this won't stop Bill from requesting
                   an audit from LB&A, but that's his prerogative. Joe Schmidt is aware of this e- mail, also. I asked him to sign off on it.

                  Good Afternoon:

                  Here is the response to your request for information to the Department of Corrections. Please contact me if any
                  clarification is needed.

                             MRSA is a staph bacteria that is resistant to most antibiotics . As far as the suggestion that there is an
                             'outbreak of MRSA ' in DOC prisons , here is what Dr. Luban, DOC Medical Officer, explained in simple
                             form:

                             MRSA exists in most places where people concentrate with their skin exposed, such as school locker
                             rooms, athletic clubs, hospitals, prisons. When a person is exposed to MRSA it becomes a problem
                             when a person 's Immune system Is weak or compromised (such as being In poor health) or when MRSA
                             is exposed to an open cut or sore. The way to prevent exposure Is through hand washing , keeping open
                             cuts or sores closed or protected...and maintaining good hygiene. DOC staff understands when taking
                             the job that they could be exposed to some dangerous situations such as Inmates who throw bodily
                             fluids, or who have Hepatitis C, Aids or MRSA.

                             As for the complaint of reduced staffing In FY 06: In FY2006 the DOC employed an average of 703
                             correctional officers (filled positions). FY2007 the DOC increased the average filled correctional officers
                             to 737 positions. The average filled correctional officer positions for the first three quarters in FY2008 is
                             744 positions. For FY 2009 the total funded CO positions has Increased to 786.

                  I hope this is helpful.
