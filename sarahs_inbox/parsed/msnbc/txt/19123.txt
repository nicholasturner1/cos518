          Hello GovernorrnrnAs one of your campaign workers and supportors during the election in
          which you achieved a note worthy victory I am compeled to share a moment or two of
          dissatifaction with you specifically and not your staff.rnrnAfter being away on work
          efforts I was reviewing the news papers here at home and read of your confronting of
          Senator Stevens over the current ethics investigations.  Your action added in my veiw to a
          broader preception of guilt then may be appropriate prior to the LE community completing
          the work.rnrnYour actions in my view and perception were opertune in nature, attempting to
          capture media exposure.  As a citizen of this state I'd perfer you focus on improving our
          economy and quality of life through a gas pipeline, mineral development, and sustainable
          resource development.rnrnOn a positive note however I did like your response to the
          legislator in California where you don't want them to tell Alaska what we can do with our
          wildlife.  Your administration sho

          uld continue their efforts in this area, while greatly increasing their efforts in
          resource development so our children will have jobs and a quality environment. rnrnThere
          is not much value to my children and grandchildren if Alaska is preserved as a pristine
          museum peice and they must leave the state to find work and a living.rnrni know you have a
          tough job, but the bottomline is: you ran for the job and responibility. rnrnTom and Patsy
          Burgess
