              Subject :               Tea Honoring First Lady of Mongolia Mrs. Onon


              Honorable Sarah Palin:




              I realize this is very short notice, however AIEF just found out about the

              Mongolian delegation's schedule from their Washington D.C. Embassy.



              I just know you would enjoy meeting the members of the Board that run this

             Foundation and the residents from Mongolia who live in the residence

             operated by the Foundation.        Realizing your focus on the PPT in Juneau at

             this time and of course the narrow calendaring window I do understand should

             you not be able to attend.



             Two students from Mongolia have lived at the residence of Irma Scavenius, a

             former teacher in Anchorage who left all her property in Homer and her home

             in Anchorage to international educational exchange and to further

             understanding between Alaskans and those of other nations. I am also faxing

             copy of our grant/scholarship application and housing application/House

             Rules for your information/files.



             AIEF recently funded the award winning UAA Seawolf Debate Team to travel to

             British Columbia in 2006 to compete in international competition as well as

             to Beijing, China to judge competitions in May 2007, funded a trip to Paris

             for Aleut Corporation members and an Anchorage Anthropologist to document

             Aleut masks taken from a cave on Attu Island in the late 1800's; and helped

             bring the Chukoma Taiko drummers to Alaska in 2005.



             The Board of Directors would be honored if you could attend the Tea honoring

             the First Lady of Mongolia. I am, of course, following up with a written

                                                                   1
