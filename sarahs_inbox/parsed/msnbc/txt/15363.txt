         I have had conversations with Speaker Harris and his staffer on the use of the funds for
         litigation. They are ok with the idea and would send us a portion of the funds for
         litigation but would like to retain some of the funds for a strategy to be determined at a
         later date on trying to develop a grass roots effort on revamping ESA in the future. We
         can talk more about that later. I am waiting for a follow up call from Harris's office
         confirming what I just stated. Rep Harris seems to be ok with it, they were going to call
         Sen. Green and get back to me.

         Makes me sick to my stomach to even consider the possibilities. What is the matter with
         these people that they'd intend to halt developments needed for mankind - do Americans
         even know what the stakes are in this???



         Anyway, yes, tell Hans we'll do what we can, full               steam ahead.

         mentioning possible effects resulting = from increased hydrocarbon supplies.
