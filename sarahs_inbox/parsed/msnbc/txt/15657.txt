               Oh my goodness. No, we did not receive an invitation and I'm calling Kyle this morning . He and I spoke a
               weeks back and he said they weren 't ready yet for a grand opening celebration but that he 'd coordinate wr
               your schedule once they were . I have not heard anything back from him since that conversation. This is
               unbelievable . Yesterday, I recd an email from Dick Lefebrve that Senator Stevens was stopping by the ne
               creamery and that was it , nothing more than that. I'll go thru old smalls from him or anyone else to make f
               didn't miss anything , but am pretty darn certain I did not . So, in other words , everyone that had NOTHING
               with this were there and those that BUSTED THEIR BUTT weren't even invited. I'm calling Kyle.

                 Kris- if you read the article this morning you'll see something's fishy

                 about it be the creamery claims it's success is due to Lyda's support-

                 and everyone under the sun was there at the grand opening incl Stevens, Younc

                 local elected officials, etc. Are we sure we didn't get any invitation to

                 attend?

                Weeks ago I had emailed franci and others offering our support at the new

                creamery's grand opening - we'd cut the ribbon or whatever - I see in

                adn they already did it. Did Beus or anyone ever invite us to kick this off I

                them?
