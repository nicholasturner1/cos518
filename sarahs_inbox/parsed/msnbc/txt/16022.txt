              Governor & Mike:
              I don't know if Law or Public Safety routinely lets you and the Governor know when we have
              an issue like this. When it comes to my attention, I forward it along so you're not surprised, but
              I don't_want to inundate you with information you might already be getting from other
              departments.

              In this case:
              1) More State employees may be involved and possibly charged;
              2) This employee apparently will be arrested for felony theft, if the information we have is
              correct.

              I have been working with DOT management staff on a potential discipline matter involving a DOT/Local 71
              employee . His duty station is in Palmer and it is alleged that he has taken a significant amount of state property
              (including fuel) for his own . We will be calling him in tomorrow to deal with the allegations on the personnel side.
               There may be others under investigation by the troopers.

             We alerted Law and the Palmer DA of our personnel process/investigation. The troopers are close to the end of
             their investigation with the same employee/state property --the conduct appears to be a felony charge due to the
             significant value of property-I am told the value is somewhere around 25-30 thousand $$.

             We sent the employee home while we dealt with the issue and will call him in tomorrow with his union
             representative to address the personnel allegations. Of course, we have worked 5th Amendment issues into our
             meeting with the employee. I understand that the employee will be arrested soon thereafter (day or two) by
             troopers.
