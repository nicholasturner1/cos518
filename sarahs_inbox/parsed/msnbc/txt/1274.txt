MESSAGE:

Congratulations, Sarah and Todd, on your new addition.



I just want you to know that I support your decision to have another- and yes, all children are a gift
from above. I know that even if Trig faces special challenges, he has been given to a family who is
intelligent, loving and supportive of their new little one. Sarah, take care of yourself. The State will
make it a few days while you take the time you need to fullfill the most important job on this planet-
being a mom.



God Bless,



Tania Dennis
