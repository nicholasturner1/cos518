             Subject: Latest Hamel Letter




             Per Chuck Hamel's request, I have attached his latest correspondence to Congressmen
             Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier letter to the House
             Energy Committee.



             I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



             P.S.

            Governor, in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with you during
            your DC trip.
