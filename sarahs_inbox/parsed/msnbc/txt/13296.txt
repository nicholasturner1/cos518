             Good. Can't believe adn repeated the mistake in the editorial today.

             Should we fully find Arctic P's request in budget or can I chop some of it off? I prefer
             to chop.

            I just heard from Adrian Herrera of Arctic Power.               He said Mr . = Liddy is still coming to
            Alaska.



            Arctic Power is taking a number of steps to correct errors = in the recent news stories,
            including contacts with the Associated = Press , Anchorage Daily News, and Fairbanks News-
            Miner.  Specifically, = AP is emphasizing that no State funds are involved in Mr. Liddy's
            visit = and that he is not being "hired." I believe that Arctic Power = intends to pay
            Mr. Liddy's travel costs from non-public funds.



            I was also told that he is contemplating a possible appearance on the = Rick Rydell show
            tomorrow further to clarify the record.
