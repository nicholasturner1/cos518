               And I know team members want time to chew on this , but as has already happened this
              morning with KTW finding me at the NEA speech and wanting responses to CP's letter - we
              can't blow any tinmely opportunity to set the record straight, asap , and lay out facts
              when we are asked. Better yet, to be pro-active and anticipate what the public is wanting
              answered . Obvious to me is the public ' s questions : " why is she refusing to talk to CP"
              (not true, but that's what they're hearing), and "is it true she just doesn't understand
              how to get this project built" ( shoot - don't defend me on this , but our team of experts
              had better be defended or Alaskans will continue to believe the big, pretty, expensive ads
              that CP pays for to tell Alaskans we're , essentially, naive, stubborn and idiotic).



               The response does need to be sent . It's fine , with minor corrections ... I don' t want us
              to over-think the response and miss opportunity to speak to Alaskans . I WILL be asked,
              continually, until we release a statement.
