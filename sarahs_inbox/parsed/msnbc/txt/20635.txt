               Governor:
               Here is the e-mail I sent to Commissioner VonScheben earlier today. My thought is to use. the opportunity of the
               mayors being in Juneau for AML to try and resolve at least some of the issues mayors have with DOT by having
               them sit down with the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, regional directors, and myself.

               Leo:

               Please note that the Alaska Municipal League will be in Juneau for its winter meeting on January 20th and
               January 218t. There could be as many as a hundred mayors in Juneau for this meeting . A significant number
               arrive the day before . Many of the mayors ask to meet with the Governor. The subject of the meetings often
               relates to Transportation issues . Several mayors were critical of DOT in their meetings about transportation and
               road issues and DOT personnel . Often DOT version of events on a project is very different.

               Rather than bounce back and forth between mayors and DOT, my suggestion is to be proactive and notify AML
               by a short letter that you, Frank , and Jeff are available for meetings the day before (January 19) and during the
               AML winter conference in Juneau (January 20-21). Mayors wanting to discuss transportation issues should
               contact Teri to set up appointments. You may even want to have Gordon Keith (Central Region ) and Steve Titus
               (Northern Region) available in Juneau . I will also help out in any way possible and attend meetings.

               Mayor Homaday from Homer was particularly critical last February and said that in years past , it has been
               tradition with the best Commissioners at DOT that project summaries for each community are worked up ahead of
               time by staff and available for the mayors to review with the Commissioner or his top level staff. While I am not
               sure if this is true or not, being prepared ahead of time does not seem like a bad idea.

               Any thoughts?

               Randy
