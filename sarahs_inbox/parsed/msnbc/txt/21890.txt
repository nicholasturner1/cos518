               Good question to ask, thank you. I'm going to Kenai today to visit with the criminal
               justice section of the bar association. I'm told they have concerns about our DOL office
               there. I will be in touch with Talis on what I hear there.



               Hope you can get some sleep ! And, now, please promise me we 'll only keep the legislature
               in session for ninety days next year. No more special sessions. :)
