          MESSAGE:

          I am very proud that my Great Uncle was the 2nd territorial governor of AK. (Alfred P.
          Swineford).  On Wed. Sept.17 from 7 a.m. to 8 P.M my wife, daughter, and granddaugher will
          be making our 1st visit to Juneau via Holland America Cruise Line. We are looking for
          suggestions as how we can enrich and meximize our knowledge of former Governor Swineford
          during the short time of our visit. We understand he is buried at your Evergreen Cemetery.




          Your ideas will be sincerely appreciated




         Respectfully,



         Donald J. Gier & Wife Evelyn.
