             Sharon-pls coordinate with Lt. Governor's office as they release this, as we don't want to
             have to follow up and explain it's Bd of Ed's call. If asked tho, u can let folks know I
             would not propose govt mandating anything like shots for our kids.

             We can try to get this word out. I believe Gail Neubrugge's grandaughter (?) was severely
             disabled by a vaccine. Dan Saddler's pretty sharp on this issue as well. This'll be a
             tough pill for some folks.
