Todd - I just received a phone call for the Governor. The lady said that she had shook hands with
the Governor at the ANC Prayer Breakfast and gave her a business card.



Sara Polanco (from Hispanic Community) - she stated that she needs to talk with the Governor
directly - can be a phone call. I explained that I needed a subject matter. Sara stated that it is
personal but it has to do with something God asked her to do for the Governor. She needs to pray
over the Governor - it can be done through the phone even. Said it was a personal matter.



Contact: Sara Polanco -         P-ed-OL-bed



I explained that the Governor's schedule for the next two weeks is very tight. She stated that she has
prayed and fasted over this and so needs to touch base soon.
