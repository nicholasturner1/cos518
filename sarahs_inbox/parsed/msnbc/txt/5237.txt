                   This is an issue that the department of Commerce usually deals with . I will refer it over to Lynne Smith.

                  Have you thought about this predicament much? If you recall, there was a
                  letter asking for assistance that I believe came into the office last week?

                   We should respond to this... would like some thoughts.

                  Thanks.

                  Hello Meghan, Sharon,

                  Rachel D'Oro here with The Associated Press, Anchorage bureau. I'm
                  working on a story that's moving Thursday and I hope one of you can help
                  me. I was working with Charles Fedulo on it but now I hear he's no
                  longer with the governor's office.
                  Here's the story: erosion has made Newtok's closest river so
                  shallow that barges can no longer make regular fuel deliveries there.
                  Fuel to operate the village power plant is being flown in, but others
                  can't afford the costly alternative.
                  So residents are looking for help to build some kind of pipeline
                  system to transport fuel delivered by barges from the next nearest
                  river. But complicating that effort, state and federal funds have dried
                  up because Newtok has begun to relocate from its increasingly battered
                  site to higher ground nine miles to the south.

                  I would like to hear the governor's thoughts on what is now a
                  unique predicament, a village in limbo with no funding at the old site,
                  but still far from completing its move. Newtok could be just the
                  beginning and could set a precedent on how government deals with similar
                  cases in the future.
                  Thanks for any insight you can share.
                  Regards,
                  Rachel D'Oro
