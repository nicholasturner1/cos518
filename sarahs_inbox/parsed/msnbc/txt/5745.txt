             Merely something to keep in the back of your mind, in case you're ever asked during a news
             conference.

             To: State Communicators/PTO's
             The FBI and DHS today released a Joint Homeland Security Assessment concerning school buses and
             Commercial Drivers Licenses . Your State Homeland Security Advisor would have received this bulletin
             when it was released.

             Federal talking points are below. FBI public affairs has the federal lead (202-324-3691).


             Talking Points

             *There is no information indicating that terrorists have been involved in procuring school buses or licenses
             to drive them. Nor is there credible intelligence to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland, at this
             time.
             *Some school districts have reported an increase in the number of foreign nationals seeking school bus
             driver positions, and generic instances of unusual activity. The vast majority of attempts by foreign
             nationals to acquire school buses and the licenses to drive them are legitimate.

             *The information shared in this bulletin is simply precautionary and serves as a longer term advisory that
             encourages vigilance for any abnormal activity.
             *DHS and the FBI have a responsibility to share information with our state and local officials and law
             enforcement partners to encourage vigilance and ensure that they have the information they need to
             make decisions for their community and critical infrastructure.
