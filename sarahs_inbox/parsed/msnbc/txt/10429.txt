                 Dear Governor Palin,

                 Enclosed is a copy of our 2007 Annual Halloween Costume Judging at Department of Labor.
                 For several years, I have attempted to create a Halloween Party better than last years and it just
                 gets better all the time! Everyone here has had a wonderful time being a child at heart so to
                 speak. This year we had someone who was your double at the Halloween Party and won the best
                 costume ever!

                 Happy Holidays,

                 Leimomi Matunding

                 Here is a test link to a final draft of your inaugural newsletter
                 hn://Pov.state.ak.us/newsletter/C)DenAKnewsletter Template. nhp

                 With your approval, we'd like to send the newsletter out sometime tomorrow so that your Christmas message and
                 the mention of the flag lowering for Judge Stewart is timely.

                 The newsletter will be mailed to all state employees and to those who have requested to be on your newsletter
                 mailing list.

                 Our plan is to provide quick, easy-to-read and fun (interactive) information. We have a lot of information in the
                 content, which was chosen specifically to hit on a number of topics:

                  * Christmas message
                  * Budget message
                  * Links to budget charts and budget web page
                  * Visual and audio images of both you and the It. governor
                 * Feature on Click Bishop to put a face on his department and to emphasize work programs
                 * Denali awards to involve state staffs
                  * Advance information on state of the state and start of the legislature
                  * USO link


                 In future issues that will publish monthly, we'll highlight other areas of the administration, depending on the season

                  and events. Kris and I had a quick minute to visit about the newsletter in Juneau last week . We can solicit some material from
                  the It. governor' s office as we progress on this project.

                  We can make any changes you' d like to see.
