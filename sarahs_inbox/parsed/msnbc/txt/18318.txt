        Wonder how the Bitney replacement mention already got in the 'Ear.



        Sheeeesh- I can trust people in this business as far as I can throw them. Have the two
        even been officially offered, and accepted, the jobs yet?



        Reading the 'Ear today was another lesson for me that nothing is considered confidential
        to some folks, so fewer and fewer people should be brought in to "think out loud" re:
        admin business.
