           How does he figure I was told it may be illegal to give Minnesota the $?



           Fyi- but donnt let dillion engage us in a tit for tat with Don Young - Don told me not to
           think about giving the money back to congress. The Minnesota bridge collapse timing of
           this was that bridges were again in natl news so i called him to ask if the feds were
           going to be able to fund the rest of gravina's project. He said there wouldnt be earmarks
           for it, i told him it couldnt be DOT's priority.



          But dont let dillon make you get in a tit for tat with don. Our dc office with john katz
          has discussed this issue with the delegations staff, they've surely been aware of the
          state's priorities esp after hearing of leo's presentation to ketchikan this summer.

          Governor-

           I haven't responded to Dillon's latest email. I am going to tell him the takeaway
          message is not abount notification but the governor making the decision in the best
          interest of alaska.  Let me know if you would like to add anything.

             What I understand from your emails is



            Palin discussed the possibility of dropping the Ketchikan bridge project with Young
          earlier this month.



            I'm still not clear if she discussed the Ketchikan bridge or that she wanted to
          discontinue the project specifically.
