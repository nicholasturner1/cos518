Emil has a message into Stedman. He'll let me know when they actually speak.

She submitted one for non exempt paybill and we have a back up plan in the house if the senate
doesn't follow thru.



I know you talked to meyer a million times-very frustrating! In our liaison mtg today russ and mindy
didn't realize studded tires was scheduled-they were pleasently surprised. I'll send studded tire info to
get this expedited.



Kris, I think biz license fee will get some traction in sen finance if emil will call stedman directly and
his liaison submits a formal hearing request-the liasion hasn't been getting any traction so this is a
good place for a cabinet member to step up. Could you talk to emil about that? I think we can get this
scheduled.

I talked with Annette last night about something separate and she mentioned was submitting her new
ones for DOA bills. This is step one in getting bills on the slate ...I've got to believe they know the
requirement to submit the letter.



It'll be interesting to see what they say.

      Wish I would have known these were missing, or even required. Does Russ or Lauren or
Mindy know to do these requests? They've spoken (so have I) to Meyer numerous times on these.

       Studded tire tax is scheduled for Sunday!




       I'll get Russ a hearing request-hopefully he has the back-up that Suzanne is requesting.

      We do need the back up information for it. He threw it on Sunday's calendar and that is when
we realized that we didn't even have a hearing request for it. Anything you all can get us would be
good!



      Thanks!

       Suzanne,




       Thanks for the email. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Rep Meyer-he's one of my
favorites. I wouldn't reference his name without first talking to him about it.




      Would Rep Meyer hear HB 106 if he received a hearing request?

       Ivy,



       Thanks for the phone call yesterday. We appreciate it. The funny thing is, I went back and
looked at hearing requests that I have received , and we haven 't even received a hearing request
from the administration for HB 106.
