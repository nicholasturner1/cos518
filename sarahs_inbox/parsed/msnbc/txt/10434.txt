              Just an fyi that I've spoken with Tom Irwin today and will meet with the DNR (Parks) staff
              tomorrow to delve into 50 hp regs. Also, I have a call into F&G (Ken Taylor, Dep.
              Commissioner) to do the same there. I'll let you know what I find out when I find out.
