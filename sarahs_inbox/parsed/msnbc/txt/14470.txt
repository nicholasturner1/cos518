          Makes sense . No lawmaker has told me what THEY want done with the abortion bills, so I've
          sort of left it up in the air, waiting to hear from them... perhaps they are polling. Let
          me know if/when you hear more . Thanks

          Dear Governor Palin,

                Deb Behr thinks Gara and French are in a hurry because the legislative leadership may
          be preparing to poll its members about calling a special session and they would be
          preparing arguments about why it should not happen. It is speculation but plausible.
