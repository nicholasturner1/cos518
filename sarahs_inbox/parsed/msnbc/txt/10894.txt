                  Subject: Nikiski beach access

                Governor, Mike
                FYI
                We are getting numerous calls from the Nikiski area regarding the closing off of beach access
                in the vicinity of Boulder Point. There is a privately owned dock ( Nikiski Offshore systems
                dock) a small port facility that the US Coast Guard has recently imposed a set of security
                restrictions on. This company supplies the off shore drill rigs in Cook Inlet. The company has
                set up a manned security post and beach access that the residents of Nikiski have enjoyed for
                decades is no longer available to them. There has been public out cry and the phones here
                have been ringing off the hook. I initiated a call to Federal Homeland Security folks to see what
                is going on as did our state HLS office and indicated the concern from the residents. This area
                is the only beach access for the locals for recreation, set net sights, boat access for about a 10
                to 15 mile stretch.

                Long story short the feds HLS folks contacted the US Coast Guard to see if they can work
                something out to ease up on the restrictions and still get acceptable security measures in place
                without denying the beach access to residents. That meeting will take place in the next week
                or so but for now it sounds like HLS feels that there may be a workable solution. I will stay on
                it.
