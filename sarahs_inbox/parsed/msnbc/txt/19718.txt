           Governor, I did not say anything without being able to run it by you first. I just talked
           to her and she said she can give us 45 minutes to get her a statement. So it is not too
           late.

          Rosanne - I understand adn contacted you re : the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and
          his claim that it was only four.

            I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone
          call and face-to-face that I had with Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.

              Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.

              Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special
          Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER refused any request to meet with any of us. He
          met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in "communications" with
          me.

             Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.

          And pls pass on the Bill McA. What's his email addy?

              Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points. Thanks

               She extended it. Randy is preparing response that Rosanne will provide, unless I can reach Bill because I'm leery
               otherwise.
