           It only makes sense too when you ' re in Anchorage that I have access to input (you too).
           Otherwise it just creates extra work and steps for others.

           Very par for the course that we can't just get that done. Janice tries to keep up, but it
           takes numerous reminders to note changes and many times it's just never completed on the
           Juneau end - especially weekends and evenings. Thanks

           I'm sure Janice will get back to you, but she is the only person that has access to
           change. I don't, but would like to so that I can help you with this more. Also, I had
           previously asked - per your request - that you have access and I'll have to find out what
           happened with that.

           Janice - instead of me bugging you throughout weekends and evenings to add to my
           officially posted schedule , who else has access to amending that calendar and can assist?

            I am fine w doing it myself if someone will show me how. We're missing things on the sched
            due to my lack of time to note and follow up on changes, due to our continual problems
            with emails being received, etc. Thank you
