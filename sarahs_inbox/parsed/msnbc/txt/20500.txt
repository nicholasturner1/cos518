             Governor,

             It was only Kami Clark who went into the master bedroom and Todd's office and she was only at each of
             the desks to have access to the computers.

             To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd
             floor.

              Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore , I just checked with the Governor's office computer folks and
              they went in on Monday, August 4th . They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the
              time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
              of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.
