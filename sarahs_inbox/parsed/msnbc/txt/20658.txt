                                       Governor Palin Signs Bill Approving AGIA License

               August 27 , 2008, Anchorage,Alaska - Governor Sarah Patin today signed House Bill 3001,
               authorizing the state to award an AGIA license allowing TransCanadaAlaska to start developing a
               1,715-mile natural gas pipeline from a treatment plant at Prudhoe Bay to the Alberta Hub in
               Canada . The Governor signed the bill at the Alaska AFL-CIO's biennial convention.

               "After dreaming of a natural gas pipeline for more than 30 years , Alaskans have now created the
               framework for the project to advance ," Governor Patin said . "This legislation brings us closer than
               we've ever been to building a gas pipeline and finally accessing our gas that has been languishing
               for so many decades on the North Slope."

               TransCanada Corporation has successfully constructed many natural gas pipelines and now
               operates more than 36,000 miles of natural gas pipelines In North America.

               "TransCanada appreciates the support the Governor , the Legislature and Alaska have shown for the
               Alaska gas pipeline, and our role as the AGIA Licensee ," TransCanada Vice President Tony Palmer
               said. "Our company has started field work on the project in order to meet our target date for
               completing the initial open season within two years."

               TransCanada Alaska.has already authorized specific aerial photography, engineering work and
               environmental gap analysis in support of the open season project. The AGIA license will be issued
               in 90 days.
