Sharon, yep- it was our second movie we've seen together in the last four years. After all the Iditarod
events on Saturday we dropped off Piper at Sarah's sister's house because we had two hours before
we attended the Spenard town hall meeting (hollis and lyndsey holmes and mike doogan invited us)
so we went to see Juno. Then we spent and hour and a half with the legislators and their consituents
at the spenard rec center. I'm glad the ear asked about this because Sarah's happy to get to tell her
that she and I spent all that time with the legislators who invited us to meet at spenard rec. It was
great being there.

A couple of locals tell Ear they went to the movies last Saturday after the Iditarod start ceremonies
and found themselves standing in line next to Sarah and Todd, who bought tickets for Juno (great
movie, by the way, if you haven't seen it yet)



I'm inclined to believe them but ...
