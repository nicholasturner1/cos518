                  Kris Perry to the rescue! Thanks Kris - great solutions here.

                    That is what she proposed . She's never been on payroll . Currently her only role is as the
                    Governor's designee as Chairperson of the Commission . I came up with a solution that will work
                    w/the Statehood Commission and hopefully minimize any hard feelings . Since this office will be
                    managing the project, I will become the Governor's designee , thereby replacing the Chairperson
                    on the commission . This should minimize anyone feeling like they 've been replaced by a "peer"
                    in the community . I spoke to Linda Perez and she gave the "all clear". I think it's a positive
                    solution and it makes sense.

                    Current staff is Patty Swenson with Commerce and she supports both the Coin Commission and
                    the Statehood Commission . However, there are changes planned . To maximize efficiencies,
                    staff support will occur with existing staff out of the Governor 's office. I'm working with Emil on
                    this.

                    Ivy and Meg are both aware . We'll get this finalized early this week.

                    Kris - the memo from Gail Phillips says she's paid $100g/yr as ex. dir, of Celebration
                    Commission... And a raise of $1Og next yr... and another raise of $10g the yr. after.

                    999


                    Is this accurate? It sounds absolutely ridiculous that the state is/was paying a full time
                    employee for this, along with budgeting for a PR firm to organize the event?

                    Is she off payroll yet?
