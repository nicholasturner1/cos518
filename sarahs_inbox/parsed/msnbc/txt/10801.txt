                  Subject: Mr. Ed Musial / Sutton

                Governor.

                Sorry to bother you with this issue, but there is a constituent by the name of Ed Musial who lives in Sutton. Mr.
                Musial believes that the State DOT did some work in the mid-1980 's that caused erosion problems on his property
                with a river. I researched the issue with DOT and LAW and found responsibility for any damages caused by the
                project were assumed by the Mat-Su Borough under a contract with DOT. Mr. Musial has been advised that the
                State is not responsible and to try and work out the issue with the Mat-Su Borough . He says this is not good
                enough and until he hears the Governor personally does not feel he is entitled to any compensation from DOT, he
                will not give up the issue.

                I just received a message from John Bitney that Mr. Musial called the Speakers office wanting your address in
                Wasilla so he can hand deliver papers outlining his claim to you . To my knowledge , that information was not
                provided. I will confirm with John.

                I do not believe this is a serious security issue , but wanted you to be aware of it. I can certainly call Mr. Musial
                and let him know the Governor agrees with DOT and the Department of Law's position that the state does not
                owe him any money and see if that resolves everything.
