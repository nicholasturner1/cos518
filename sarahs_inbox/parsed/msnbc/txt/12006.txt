             Governor - Good thing you and girls got out last night .                    The wind and snow are terrible
             today.



             Commissioner Lloyd had emailed a request earlier today to see if you would like to do a
             stop by at the Board of Fish meeting next door to the Millennium - apparently they are
             there until approx . 5:00 p . m. The Commissioner also asked if you would like any
             assistance at the banquet tonight.



             You may not even be in ANC until after 5:00 p.m. tonight but I told him I would check.
             Thanks , Janice
