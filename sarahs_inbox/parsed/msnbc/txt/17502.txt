          Besides a trip to Fairbanks on May 3 and Skagway on May 7, the Governor will be in Juneau the first couple
          weeks of May. UNLESS she could do the Denali event Friday, May 4 in Anchorage on her way back to Juneau,
          but we need to see when she wants to return to Juneau after Fairbanks. Kari.

          Subject: Denali awards

          The winners of the Governor's Denali Awards have been selected. These awards recognize state
          employees for excellence in service to the State of Alaska. Most of the winners are from the
          Anchorage area . Will the Governor be in Anchorage during the second week of May? If the awards
          could be handed out then, it would coincide with Public Service Recognition Week.

          Thanks
