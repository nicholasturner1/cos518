               Dear Governor Palin,
                   Just for your information. The attachment, in case it does not open, is a complaint filed by various
               environmental groups against the National Marine Fisheries Service for failing to act in a timely manner to list
               beluga whales under the endangered species act.

                     Just saw the unveiling of the Peratrovich statue downtown . Begich and Diane Benson did the talking.
               Begich acknowledged Sen. Ted Stevens but did not invite him forward or offer him a chance to talk. Sen.
               Stevens then left the scene completely just as it started . After the statue was unveiled then Begich remembered
               to invite Lt. Gov. Parnell to speak. The Lt. Gov. spoke and read part of your letter which was presented to the
               artist In the crowd were Arlis, Fran, Steve Reiger, the Peratrovich family members, a few others and mostly
               tourists.

              Greetings: Please see the above complaint filed by five organizations and relating to Cook Inlet Beluga Whales.
              The web site for the Center for Biological Diversity states that the complaint was filed today, June 30, 2008, in the
              District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges the 6 month extension invoked by NMFS
              under the ESA on April 22, 2008. CBD filed a 60 day notice of intent to sue on April 23, 2008. NMFS and the
              Secretary of Commerce have 60 days to respond to the complaint. I will verify the filing with the District Court for
              the District of Columbia and check on any motions that may have been filed at the same time. I have provided
              this information to ADF&G. Brad

               Governor, DOT&PF needs approval to proceed with a mitigation transaction for the Juneau Access project The
               Department has asked Southeast Alaska Land Trust to obtain an in-holding in Point Bridget State Park that is for
               sale by a family that would like the land to be protected. The cost is approximately $ 500,000. While this
               purchase is to fulfill a mitigation commitment for JA, it can be used to mitigate impacts to marine waters from
               other projects (e.g. highways along a shore, ferry terminals, an airport in tidelands , etc.) if the JA project is not
               constructed . This acquisition will be made with federal transportation funds that are already obligated and in-hand
               for this purpose. The acquisition fulfills a commitment made by FHWA and is supported by resource agencies as
               it will protect habitat, and will benefit the state parks system because the land will be transferred to the park
               system rather than be privately developed.

               This mitigation process is required by all the resource agencies on all projects through the permitting process. It
               is a little like the 1% art factor on new buildings.

               SEAL Trust must submit a bid by July 3, the deadline set by BIA who holds the land in trust for the Native owner.
               The funds do not need to be transferred by then , but they need to know if the money will be available as soon as
               possible before July 3.

                      I will emphasize to the Senator that the Administration is very much on board with in-
                      state use and also our plan for using petroleum revenues to address short term needs,
                      particularly those related to energy costs.

                      I think this is all we may need to do for now. In honesty, messages from the gas team
                      have not registered well with the Senator although this may change in the aftermath of
                      your recent meeting with him.

                      When I wrote you earlier, I was unaware of the Senator's plans - and he did not mention
                      them - to talk publicly on July 2nd and 3rd about his initiatives to "bring short and long-
                      term energy relief to Alaskans ." (See below). His original idea was to use your initiatives
                      and the second special session to show Congress how petroleum revenues could be used
                      at the federal level.

                      Perhaps, we should postpone a definitive response to the Senator until we see what
                      transpires tomorrow . In the meantime, I can convey your thoughts about in-state use, etc
                      and see how he responds.

                      Does this sound like a plan?

                    Does he realize we are very supportive of instate also and I've asked the AGIA team to ramp up
                    that message publicly, as I fear that message was lost through the revealing of the TC-Alaska "big
                    line" plan? Marty could provide the Senator more infomation on precisely what were doing to
                    ensure in-state use and benefits of our gas. (I'd hope his testimony would acknowledge that we're
                    on the same page with in-state.)
                      Also, hopefully he could weave in that our Surplus Revenue Return proposal shows how oil/gas
                    revenue DOES help ourselves as we attempt to relieve burdens on AK residents by returning
                    surplus dollars to them to help meet the rising cost of living - it's a short term plan as we work
                    towards conservation and long term energy relief plans.

                    He does support an in-state solution. However, his primary objective would be to show the
                    Congress how state oil revenues can be used to benefit the citizenry. He believes that the second
                    special session will exemplify how opening ANWR and offshore areas in Alaska would provide
                    significant non-tax revenues to the U.S. Treasury, thereby benefitting the economy in several
                    ways.

                    For whatever it's worth, I believe that this is a good idea. I'm not sure that anything will budge
                    the Democratic Leadership in Congress, but the publicity should help keep the spotlight on
                    Alaska's oil and gas resources.

                    I think that the ultimate decision about his testifying must be made. by the Legislature. However,
                    the Senator didn't want to proceed without your approval. My guess is that the beneficial
                    electoral implications are not lost on the Senator, either.

                    I also mentioned to him that we would probably respond to Dan Pagan's Sunday column, which I
                    characterized as beyond fair criticism of a politician in a situation where Fagan had previously
                    been apprized of the facts.

                    Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

                Per our conversation , I have sent the communication below to Senator Stevens . Hopefully,
                it captures the essence of what we discussed.

               As I mentioned, I communicated earlier today with the Senator to emphasize the Governor's
               commitment to the in-state use of natural gas and to seek support for the use of petroleum
               dollars to defray citizen's energy costs.

                If I hear anything further, I will let you know.

      i         P.S.
                Should I provide a "heads up" to Senator Murkowski as well?

                  I was just advised by two members of the Governor' s gas team, and I thought that you
                  should know as well, that tomorrow there will be a press advisory announcing a press
                  conference on Monday at which the State will announce a two-phase public/private
                  partnership to bring affordable natural gas to residents of the railbelt. The gas team
                  believes that this project will underscore the importance that.the Governor attaches to
                  in-state production and use of natural gas.

                  As you can imagine, rumors are swirling about your two energy related press events.
                  The gas team feels that we have made significant progress under AGIA, especially in
                  terms of the Trans-Canada proposal but also the competition for transport that it has
                  generated. The team is hoping that you have come to this conclusion as well and is
                  willing to provide further information to you if that would be helpful.
