              Thanks for letting me know. By the way, nice Compass piece this morning. It was a topic I
              was thinking should be written. . .glad you got to it. The more we can write on these topics
              that impact the economics of our state, the better.

             Thank you!    And I would say this is due to the great work of the DC Office personnel.

              Subject : Anti - Alaska Riders




              I am pleased to report that none of the anti-Alaska policy riders = described below and in
              my memorandum of October 9th has apparently been = included in the omnibus appropriations
              bill currently under considerat = ion by Congress.



              I would like to say that the absence of these riders is due to the = efforts of your DC
              office . Hopefully , our advocacy was a = factor .  However , full disclosure compels me to
              say that the biggest = factors were the anti - rider stance of the Bush administration and
              the = procedural situation in Congress which made it difficult to include riders = in the
              omnibus bill.



              The riders   ( or threats of riders ) would have -



              * Required that Alaska return federal highway funds for the Gravina          = Island and Knik Arm
              Bridges=20

              * Restricted oil and gas leasing in NPR - A and North Aleutian Basin=20

              * Prohibited the use of federal funds to build new roads in the = roadless areas of the
              Tongass National Forest, thereby sharply restricting = timber harvest. =20

              * Restricted Alaska's wolf management program=20

              * Limited claims of access under RS2477=20

              * Prohibited the importation of polar bear parts from Canada, = thereby jeopardizing polar
              bear management in Northern Canada.



              Other anti - Alaska initiatives , such as additional wilderness in the = Tongass and the
              Coastal Plain of ANWR , never came up in the appropriations = process .   However , with a new
              President and Congress, we can = expect these to reemerge in the future.



              P.S.

              In a later spreadsheet , we will report on the fate of the State ' s = various appropriations
              requests and also other funding for Alaska.
