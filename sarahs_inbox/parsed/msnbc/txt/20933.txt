         FYI




         I have scheduled and confirmed ACES briefings for:




         Senate Majority - 10.10.07 at 2:00 p.m.




        Senate Minority - 10.11.07 at 8:30 a.m.



        Both briefings will be held at the Atwood Bldg., gov's conf. room.



        These were the dates that worked best for these groups considering all of the scheduling
        conflicts.




                                                                 1
