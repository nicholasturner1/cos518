            Governor,



            Walt called and said they have located the crash and one survivor has been reported.
            There was a helo with three technology employees probably out working on our remote
            emergency communications equipment.  The helo went down somewhere near sheep mountain.



            One of the employees evidently took his 12 year old son. This is a very sad event for
            those involved and their families . However, there are serious questions about why a child
            was on the flight. There may have been contractors involved as well as state employees.
            We will need to get all this sorted out.



            Mike
