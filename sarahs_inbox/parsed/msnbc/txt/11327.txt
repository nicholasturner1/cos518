                Nick Begich just called to let us know about the passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones , the last native speaker of the
                Eyak language. She was 89 years old. Mr. Begich's wife is Sheila Slate who is the adopted daughter of Chief
                Smith. Sheila and Chief Jones met the Governor at an event at the Alaska Native Heritage center just a month or
                two ago. Chief Slate thought the world of the Governor, and so her family just wanted to let the Governor know of
                her passing . The funeral is this Friday , with a viewing from 11am - 1 pm and funeral service at 1 :00. Then they'll
                have the traditional potlatch after 40 days.
