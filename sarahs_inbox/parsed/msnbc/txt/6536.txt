          Mr. Hogan,

           Its great you are going to hire more staff. I hope they don't need a

          background clearance! This is a fix that is a couple of months down the

          road, if not longer and we need action now. May I suggest 2 solutions for

          now. 1: Put your people on 12 hour shifts (like mine are now) until you have

          caught up the backlog. 2: Let us go back to doing name checks till you get

          the department fixed. We need our clearances now not in two months. The cost

          to us is prohibitive, and wearing on our staff, and yet you have no sense of

          urgency in this matter. What do I do when I have no staff left, put 32

          residents on the street? Please let me know what you intend to do now, not

          two months from now. Thank You, Mark Arnold
