              We need to do one that applauds the leggies for their good work on the muni revenue bill.
              It wasn ' t as much as I'd asked for to share with Alaska ' s communitities , and as a former
              10-yr local government official I am confident local communities can better prioritize
              their needs than state government can, but I am pleased with their committment to fund
              Muni Sharing for the next three years . They took our proposal and made it better, and I
              appreciate them for working together to accomplish this.



              We can also say something nice about the Educ Funding bill- since no one seems to be
              screaming about their reduction in the BSA that we proposed . Again , good job lawmakers.



              Mike- if there are individual lawmakers deserving, public kudos ,                let's plug their names
              into the presser ( s) and gain something , hopefully.
