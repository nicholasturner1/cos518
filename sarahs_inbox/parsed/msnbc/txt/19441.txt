             The ADN ran 4 gas pipelinelenergy plan compass pieces in their Sunday addition written by: Gregg
             Erickson, Fagan, and Halcro. The fourth was the ADN editorial. Aftre the summary I included the link
             for you guys.

             ADN Editorial: The bottom line was With TransCanada's bid, the state has a strong card for getting
             what Alaska needs in the gas line game. This is no time to give that card up." Very positive piece. They
             write that they disagree with former Gov Knowles proposal to suspend AGIA saying it would work
             against the interest of Alaskans. b.9p://www.adn.com/opWon/story/4`63266.html


            Erickson: He's praising the governor for her energy rebate plan. He agrees the payments represents a
            distribution of Alaskas resource wealth, and then goes thru some arguments from legislators: Doogan
            says the resources are commonly, not individually owned; Gara says we shouldnt give a divided to rich
            Alaskans (we could point out its optional to accept the rebate); lastly, he says some legislators dont see
            an end to giving out the rebate on an annual basis. He concludes with saying that Palins plan is better
            than any political alternative, and legislators should get over their fear of letting go of control of state
            resources.

              Fagan: Fagan continues to write crap . This piece is about what he calls the list of all of the blunders of
              the administration and campaign. His list includes: Wasilla Chamber debate when the governor said
              shed favor Wasilla; demonizing the former Mat-Maid board and then replacing them all ; a joint
              appearance by the governor and Tom Irwin on Fagans show when the governor said she was negotiating
              w producers and Tom said the state was not ; the governor on the Pocarro show saying ACES creates an
              atmosphere of investment; the governor using the word competition to describe agia; the governor calls
              the denali project an 11 pg PowerPoint presentation ; the governor accuse oil companies of warehousing
              our gas; the governor declares Pt Thompson is no longer needed to build a pipeline . He ended with
              saying the ultimate deception was crafting a carefully worded op-ed last week re: statehood book. He
              says he talked with the FL publishing company and they said they worked closely with the
              administration.


              Im happy to work with Sharon, Frank , Tom, etc on tracking . down what was actually said during these
              various appearances to correct his untruths point by point.

              Halcro: Halcro pc is on rah rah policy making . To try and discredit the in-state plan he used a quote
              from Doogan from last week, "As I understand it, what's different between today and the day before
              there was a press conference is that there has been the announcement of a partnership that has yet to be
              formed, to ship gas that has yet to be discovered in what seems to be the wrong direction , in a pipeline
              that has yet to be built and details will follow.

              Halcro chooses not to mention that Doogan went on to commend the governor for trying to find a
              solution to the energy crisis, and for supporting an in-state line where Akns get gas first.

              He also tries to discredit the argument that the TC plan is an insurance policy that keeps the producers
              honest He writes that Pat Galvin said if a future legislature adopts new tax rules or fiscal certainty to
              move a gas pipeline forward and Denali also moves forward it will trigger the treble damages clause and
              the sate would be forced to pay TC more than $100 million. Halcro calls it the Thelma and Louise
              insurance policy. We join hands with TC and it ensures we drive off the cliff.

              I copied and pasted the entire article to Pat, Tom, and Marty to review, and copied Sharon.
