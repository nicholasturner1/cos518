              Russ,

              As you know I met with Gold Cache Bingo , Anchorage Bucs and the Independent Blind groups today . All entities
              are non-profits impacted by charitable gaming ; relying on raffles and pull -tabs for revenue . They wanted to
              express their support for SB 59. In their opinion it doesn 't expand gambling ; it increases the threshold from $1
              million to $2 million which they say hasn 't been increased since at least 1987. They said that because there
              hasn 't been an increase , with inflation and the increased cost of doing business , they are actually losing money in
              some cases . This bill provides for inflation proofing.

              Aside. from the increase and the allowance of the cabbage classic , I'm not overly familiar with all the details of the
              bill. Privileged or Persprivileged or Personal Material Redacted
