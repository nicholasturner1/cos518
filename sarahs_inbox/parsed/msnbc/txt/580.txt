Hi Todd,



Thanks for the info. I was looking forward to seeing her, hopefully another trip will work out. What a
great experience for your family to be out fishing.



Linda Perez called the other day about dropping the "Assistant" part off of my title but that I would still
continue with my previous duties. I totally understand- and wanted to communicate that I assume
that I would still process things and do what needs to be done- but that you don't need a person
designated as your assistant. My number one goal is to do things how you and the Governor see fit,
so please let me know if I missed something in what was communicated in regards to the change.



Thanks,

Erika
