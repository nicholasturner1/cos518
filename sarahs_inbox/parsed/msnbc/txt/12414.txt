           it was a good mtg. He's fine about psio funding and is wanting to assist me. He's very
           frustrated tho that he believe BP snookers psio into believing they've got it all under
           control - and sihe still cant believe psio let up on GC 1 fire investigation.



           And Larry- i promised Hamel you'd call him. He at least wants a quiuck convo on a couple
           of issues that he, again, believes we're getting snookered on. Pls call him. Thanks

           Governor,



          Unfortunately, the Hamel letter is a pdf, and cannot be pasted. Hamel is in DC, as far as
          I know.  Jonne will be in the office in 30 mina, and will provide a more detailed report
          to this group then, including a summary of the Hamel letter.



          In short, the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation (given its staffing
          limitations), and pushing BP very hard. PSIO has completed a thorough technical review
          that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak, and the
          final section of the report, an addendum addressing materials traceability, will be
          completed in the next day or two. We'll send it to Mr. Bewak directly and post it on the
          PSIO website.



          As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
                                                        3

                  info, you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr. Hamel ( I assumed that's why you
                  asked where he is)
