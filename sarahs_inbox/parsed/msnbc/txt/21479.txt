              Rhonda McBride.      Holy cowl I'll be star struck. Nice job, governor.



              I finished up hunter safety today w/ those great 6th graders .        There should be an article
              in the Empire tomorrow . Thank you for inviting me to attend.



              Had a long conversation with Lyda today-it was positive. I was candid and so was she. I
              see potential there.  I have a call in to Tibbles to share my thoughts.



              Take care
