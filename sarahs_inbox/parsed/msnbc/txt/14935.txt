          dear governor palin,




                   this morning when i opened my Sunday paper i saw the first photo of you,your
          husband and your new beautiful son,all beaming with pride and it truely made me teary
          eyed.i am the single adoptive dad to 4 boys.2 of whom have down syndrome. one was an
          abandoned toddler from cuba,left in ft myers florida and the other a new born boy left
          at a hospital in boston on at 4 days old as his ethiopian family could not/wouldnot accept
          that he had down syndrome. when i tell you that you have been blessed i sincerely mean
          it.my boys are the joy of my life.they are happy,well adjusted and loved.milestones are
          different but they come along.youll be inundated with more information than you want i
          am sure but i will simply say he will be one of the many joys of your life.enjoy every
          second of him.raise him as you have your other kids and dont fret at the slower pac ed
          milestones..dr.alan crocker,one of the worlds leading doctors for kids with d/s tells
          parents  simply"enjoy them" and h

          e is so right. so congratulations on the birth of your beautiful son,my best,peter wyman
