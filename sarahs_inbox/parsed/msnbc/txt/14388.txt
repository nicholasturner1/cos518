             MESSAGE:

             Gov

             Congratulations on your newly born son! You will be a busy lady but God will help you with
             your burdens. Please maintain your conservative values and I hope that someday you will
             consider becoming the first female president. Rush Limbaugh espouses you highly and often.

             Please help us be able to use our own petroleum resources (Alaska ,Gulf of Mexico,etc) also,
             in order for us not to be held hostage by unfriendly countries.

            But mainly continue to love and enjoy your family and the Man upstairs will provide. God
            Bless You and America
