            Phone calls are fine from our view, as well. (Calls to top CEOs after arrangements are made through appropriate
            subordinates in AK. Meaning, this enables the Ak based people to brief the CEO before your call--they will be
            prepared for you to say you hope they will take a fresh commercial look at participating under AGIA.)

            I am with Marty. Marty will talk to you about this today at the 4 o'clock meeting. Basic answer is that we are
            recommending phone calls, not travel.

             Thanks, we just came out of our meeting with Kinder Morgan . I can brief you more later, but it is clear that they will be
             calling Conoco and BP to check their pulse . Kinder Morgan will ask whether the cos message has changed from their
             comments during the legislative process (ie are you guys reconsidering participating now that AGIA has passed)

              I was curious whether you had made contact with the producer cos since AGIA passage to say, "I heard your comments
             during legislative process, and hope you 'll consider participating in responding to the RFA once it is out."

              Had a good talk with
              Lisa. Of interest, she has been working Village Safe Water projects too (particular focus on Buckland). Very frustrated but
            thinks she's making progress . I am going to hook up my staff with hers so we can get more info and better coordinate.

              AGIA: I told her of my trip and she was happy to hear of more interest. She raised concerns about tone of a PPT special
            session. She suggested that your message continue to be one of fair share relative to other jurisdictions (and steer away from
            the punitive talk of the Dems given that we want more companies investing here (and PPT hits more than just the producers).
            It was a good meeting , much too short.

              On airplane for SEA now . I will overnight there and finish to Houston tomorrow morning.
