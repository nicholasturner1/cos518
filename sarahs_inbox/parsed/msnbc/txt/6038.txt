        MESSAGE:

        The Sheldon Museum & Cultural Center would like to invite you to visit our museum during
        your visit to Alaska's Southeast State Fair in Haines on July 26-28, 2007 (or whenever you
        are in the neighborhood!). The Sheldon Museum has received an award from the President's
        Committee on the Arts and the Humanities entitled Coming Up Taller for the Museum's
        Tlingit Language and Culture Program . We have on display the plaque we received from
        Laura Bush at the White House on January 22, 2007, as well as related Tlingit program
        pictures and artifacts.  We would very much appreciate your taking time to visit. Thank
        you.
