         Yes - those and the comments re: what "must haves" are causing producers' heartburn? Jobs?
         Gas? Timelines? Expandability? Theyre reasonable requirements and because theyre fair
         rules, they disallow undue influence or "politics" to be part of the evaluative process in
         choosing best applicant. Everyone shall be treated equally and fairly when the must haves
         are intact.

         Subject: MUST-HAVE COMMENTS FOR BLOOMBERG



         Bloomberg would like some must-have comments from you. Are these okay? Based on what you
         told Stefan yesterday...




         Governor Sarah Palin:



         Our must-haves are must-haves for a reason. We must have them for Alaskans. AGIA does us
         no good without parameters. If the must-haves were to be removed, it would lead to
         futility as the last negotiations and wouldn't be fair to Alaskans or applicants. The
         must-have requirements and rules will also assist the state in its final selection process
         and assure Alaskans that no undue influence is tainting the process.
