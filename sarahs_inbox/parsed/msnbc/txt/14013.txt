            Holy geez . What a leader he is. He's pulling this even though we're humbling ourselves and
            going forth with some of his capital projects that we have the power to kill. Amazing.
            God help us today.

            Will do.



            FYI that Bert reacted to Tuesday's press conference (yours) by putting a

            hold on all gov's bills. He even had one pulled off the schedule for

            the next day. Very original... and mature, of course. He's going to

            either change his tune or answer to such behavior. We can talk about

            the next step, as it relates to other issues, today.

            Mike / Russ : remember to hold Meyer accountable for fulfilling his

            committment to holding the hearing on CON today. You were there when he

            told me he would do this today . We have compromised on things to assist

            him with this budget and other things ,   to the detriment of my

            fulfillment of some strong committments and convictions - leading to

            some inconsistencies on my ( and our admin ' s) part. He must fulfill his

            committment now on this - it's the right thing to do for Alaska , and for

            him to break his word now will unfortunately prove Meyer is not

            trustworthy . That would lead me to not trusting him on the budget that

            is in the works today . So, make sure he's following through on today's

            CON hearing before giving green light to his budget wishes . Thanks



            Also , Russ - pls make sure Bert feels pressure to hustle with my Tire

            Tax and Business License bills , and that he acts on them . especially

            before I ' m asked to make amends with any senator in his caucus re: their

            annoyance over my statements concerning the special session call and

            budget shenanigans.
