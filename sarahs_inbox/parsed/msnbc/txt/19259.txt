              Per the Governor's request, I have drafted the = paragraphs below for Senator Cornyn's blog. As
              you will note, I have = not included a lot of statistics but have tried to articulate some general
              themes.

                Senator Cornyn's office contacted me regarding Governor Palin providing = a short written statement
                on her energy policy to post on his website for = the virtual Energy Independence Days next week.
                The purpose of the virtual event is to provide a forum to discuss the importance of US energy =
                independence. I thought we could send a short statement regarding = Governor Palin's stance on
                ANWR drilling, OCS, and her gas pipeline = plan. All three policy positions of Governor Patin
                correlate with US = energy independence by increasing domestic production. The email I = received
                is below. Would you like to touch base on putting together = a few paragraphs? Also, what do you
                know of Senator Cornyn?



                Thanks,

                The Senator will be hosting virtual "Energy Independence Days" next = week in which we'll have a
                new splash page, buttons/widgets, video of him = talking about drilling in the U.S., ect. Newt
                Gingrich has written a guest = post for us and we're going to have other electeds discussing the =
                importance of American Energy Independence.

                It would be AMAZING to get a simple 2-3 paragraph guest post by the = Governor, a podcast, or a
                video that we could use to help us get the = message out. She is obviously one of the most effective
                people in this = regard and adding her name to our initiative, even in the form of a guest = post would
                be awesome.

                If we need to write something up and have them sign off, or whatever = it is, it would be awesome.

                We're also going to be doing a blogger conference call, if she was = interested in being on that we
                could work our schedule around her.
