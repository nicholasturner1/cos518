Awesome. Let me know if I can help.

Also, it doesn't matter whether or not gov palin supports universal hlth care or not-hollis' bill died at
the hands of his peers not the governor's. I don't think she supports it as a fiscal conservative-the
costs to the state would be astronomical and it would take away competition. I don't think we need to
open ourselves up to a policy debate over universal hlth care, but I don't think any states have
implemented such a program-just Canada. I think we focus on what we have implemented and what
we plan to implement and how we're not giving up on CON repeal-like you said w the help of karleen.

I agree- I say we get Commissioner Jackson involved. Commissioners need to shoulder some of this
stuff as well.

I'm forwarding an ADN editorial that says the governor has not been a leader in improving hlth care
for Alaskans . I think it warrants setting the record straight as it says she has done nothing but create

a consumer database that died b/c it was tied to the "dubious" repeal of con.

She extended coverage in the state's insurance plans to extend well baby coverage (preventative
and pre-natal care for babies 0-24 mos) 2 months ago. I'm sure Anna can give other examples of
how she has succeeded and which reccs from the hlth council we're implementing. Also, her
proposed repeal of CON failed not b/c of her, but b/c legislative leaders killed it.
