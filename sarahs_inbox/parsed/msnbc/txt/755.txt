Todd,

This link has all the information on the summit and includes a schedule. You can expect about 50
young fishermen from around the state along with North Pacific Council members at the reception
you will be attending. The focus of the summit is to get young fishermen thinking about running a
fishing operation like a business, thinking about quality, markets, insurance, financing, etc. Let me
know if I can provide any more information or if you have questions.

Cora
