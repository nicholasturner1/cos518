           Subject:                 Lay Offs?


           Bill- pls find out if Megan Peters was absent from work yesterday, hence KTUU's inability
           to get any answers from DPS regarding their claims that troopers may be laid off.

              Mike- pls ask Mr. Glass why KTUU had to report that they didn't get answers, and also
           ask what this story was about anyway. What troopers may get laid off? Who does he believe
           directed or approved this? And what happens today - as it was reported "troopers will
           learn their fate tomorrow"?

              Kelly- pls ask their leg liasion if there's some misunderstanding that the DPS budget
           was cut by lawmakers, thus necessitating lay offs (as PSEA has been claiming in their
           media interviews)... and remind the liasion that we increased their budget and no one from
           admin has directed lay offs and we're unaware of any need.to pink slip troopers - in fact
           quite the opposite we're anxious to learn of their actions towards an aggressive
           recruiting plan so they can add more necessary troopers. (Karen and Annette have more
           details if they're unclear on what the legislature did in actually approving INCREASED
           line. items for DPS.)

              Obviously nothing makes sense in the recent media reports regarding claims that
           troopers will learn their fate today re: threatened pink slips, but it will be helpful to
           learn why DPS didn't have responses to KTW last night, why PSEA would ever claim that lay
           offs may be pending (and how the tragic Bonnie Craig murder case would be relevant to
           this, as KTUU suggested), and what is special about August 20 as that's the date troopers
           will reportedly learn their fate?

              Very unfair to the public.to have all these unanswered questions so it's imperative the
           answers are quickly assimilated and aggressively presented to Alaskans today - so those
           whom we serve may have the confidence in their public safety organization that they
           deserve, and so citizens aren't left confused as to what we just accomplished with the
           legislature in terms of budget increases and contract negotiations. A press conf with
           Annette's participation (and DPS leadership) is warranted on this - that may be the only
           way to get the truth out there. Short of that, a press release clarifying and correcting
           all the recent erroneous reports must go out today so I'd like Bill, Randy and Annette to
           do that as they get DPS leadership's clarifications on the record also. Truly, this is all
           horribly unfair to the public for them to be deceived concerning our intentions and
           actions with trooper positions. Thanks

               time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
               of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

               Steve:



               I'm not copying Jill on this because I want you to have control of this e-mail.



               Tonight's story at 5 was horrifying. To bring up a sensational murder and rape, to throw in Monegan, and then to talk about
               phantom budget cuts with no attribution was simply appalling to the governor, as well as to me.



               I e-mailed Jill twice on this point beforehand, but apparently it needs to be said over and over. The governor's office has done
               nothing. Nothing, nada, no way. There is no story here, at least as concerns us.



               The personnel office within the Department of Administration sent out a message to every state department concerning non-
               permanent positions. My understanding is this is pretty much standard operating procedure, but in any case there was no
               effort to target a department, let alone a division within a department . This concerns all of state government, and is handled
               by Admin, not by the governor's office. By raising Monegan's firing in the intro, the obvious implication is that the governor
               has something to do with pending cuts in the cold case unit or elsewhere. (And what was meant by saying the troopers would
               learn their fate tomorrow? Says who?)



               I pleaded with Jill to get her answers from the Department of Public Safety - it's their budget, after all - but all we saw was
               the union guy on the screen. If the acting commissioner and/or others are not commenting , then please say so. Don't leave the
               impression that the governor's office is stonewalling . This has nothing to do with us.



               And it sure would be nice to know where all of this is coming from. Jill cited no sources for these alleged budget cuts.



               I would like a response, please.



               -Bill

                No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as its not
                comforting at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who
                went to the bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th
                event,that occurred while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

              Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor's office computer folks and
              they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Errlca was not available at the
              time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
              of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

              If anyone has an answer, pis let me know asap:
              I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails from
              computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were
              the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it was that
              this occurred. Thank you
