Right on!



And good, now you have my new yahoo addy. The spalin one isn't checked often - only when Todd's
in Wasilla it seems.



We'll let you know when the war room crew shin-dig will take place.



Thanks! And God bless you too.

Hi guys!



Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name(s) to me for selection, then on to the legislature for
confirmation.



We need innovation in that seat. Both your names brought forward are great. Not sure why Ed Bd
thinks it needs a nationwide search, which I heard recently. I'll ask Lynne Smith to check the status
on that and ask what my input is worth in terms of their method of soliciting names.



Thank you guys. You're awesome. Keep up the great work - I miss (six months later) our of rag-tag
team of hardcore workerbees. Maybe the crew can get together for a shin dig soon? I know Kris and
Todd miss the campaign folks too. Six months zipped by - I'd love for us all together. Don Benson,
Mark Fish, Perdews, Mary, etc, all of us!
