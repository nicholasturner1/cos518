        Dear Governor Palin,        Apparently the Mat Maid Bd abruptly altered their

        planned time table to close in November and changed it to Jlu 7 last

        night.      The reason appears to be simple math. The losses between

        January and April alone were $700,000.00, far more than expected and

        they had not even sought that much of an appropriation.

                    In addition to the producers there will be about 44 jobs at the

        creamery that will end.

                    The alternate federal grant for another creamery which would

        have been a competitor of sorts is being appealed and is therefore on

        hold for now. It may be that that was being indirectly being appealed

        by Mat Maid itself through another entity. So, that appeal may lose

        momentum, but in any event, there will be a gap for quite some time were

        there is no local market for the dairy farmers short of transporting the

        milk to the Northern Lights dairy in Fairbanks which does not seem to

        have the capicity to process all of the milk should it actually get

        there.

                    That is what I was able to find out so far this afternoon.

        Talis

        We're not going to leave the farmers hanging.



         I can't believe those boards and MatMaid management let it get so bad

        before taking action.

        Thia has to go to Irwin and Rutherford also .         I don ' t think they're

        aware of the board's intention either.



        Sounds like a mess.
