          I just read the kitchen thing that we were talking about. Very odd... I'll think on that
          one- and let you know if I can think of where that might have come from... That's really
          a strange and bothersome one; I don't like that it's someone's view where only FF and
          House staff should have access to- even if it's not accurate.



          Hope you took some cookies with you, we won't have any tours for quite a while.



          Thanks,

          EriKa
