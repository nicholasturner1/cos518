            Megan: I don't know if our folks had anything else they wanted to tweak for print version, but if
            there's nothing else to add (to more fully explain the $500 match) then I'm good to go with the tv
            version turned into a print version. I'll cc the others to ask their input. (I don't know if I ever saw
            Bruce's print version - would you send it to me again?)

            thanks Meg!

            and I think the Anch. Assembly's idea on resollution is excellent. We'd be thrilled to have their
            support.

            thanks! and thanks for all the Fairbanks work this weekend too. It went well.

            MEA will be a huge challenge next week. It's tough to guess everyone's motives in that arena.

              Governor,

              Did you want the gasline piece that you, Irwin, and Rutherford rewrote for television
              to be the print version as well? Or can I use Bruce 's version for the print version?

              Thanks,
              Meg
