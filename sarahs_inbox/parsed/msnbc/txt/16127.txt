            For your information and files , I wanted you to have the attached letter from Governors
            Manchin and Palin to Congress urging support for federal - state programs that assist states
            in promoting energy security.




            Rosanne / Sharon, this might be worth a press release on a slow news day given the State's
            current efforts with respect to energy policy and Governor Palin ' s leadership on NGA's
            Natural Resources Committee.
