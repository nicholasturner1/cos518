             > April 23, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green's request
             to expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin
             today outlined her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can
             show a path to success.

            > House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial-birth abortion, and House Bill
            364, relating to parental consent , failed due to inaction by the Senate . The Governor
            expressed disappointment that Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option
            during the regular session to move the legislation.

            > "Alaskans know I am pro-life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of
            every human life," Governor Palin said. " These issues are.so important they shouldn't be
            diluted with oil and gas deliberations."

             > Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently
             than last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the
             full Senate.
