Dear Governor Palin:



I recently read a news item about your new baby and your challenges as governor . We have a new,
unique educational/organizational/therapeudical software program (a tool we have named "My
Knowledge Repository") which MIGHT be able to help you all with both issues , that we would like to
provide to you at no cost.



If something like this is of interest, please let me know and I will forward you a description of it, and
my ideas of how the "Repository" might be of assistance to you.



Kind regards,

                                                     1                                 ROSTON 02426
