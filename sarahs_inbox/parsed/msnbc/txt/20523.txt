            It's ok that he contacts me, but especially this morning I needed someone to contact him
            to let him know I was really trying but it wasn't working with a slammed schedule to hook
            up on his show . The one call I got to make to him- he didn ' t answer. Then I was in a mtg
            and it just wasn't working.

            Just talked with his producer AGAIN! I told him to walk into the studio

            and tell Bob to stop contacting you.
