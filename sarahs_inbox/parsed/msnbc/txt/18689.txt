             Gentlemen:
             Last night at approximately 10:45 PM SECC Duty Officer received a call that Kivalina had lost
             approximately 1,000 feet of their approximately 1,600 foot long sea wall. This puts the fuel tanks at
             significant risk. Additional residents voluntarily evacuated to Red Dog Mine. More than 2/3 of the
             residents have evacuated, estimates are that 50 people are still in the village. North West Arctic Borough
             is providing supplies to Red Dog Mine to support the babies and children in shelter there.

             DHS&EM has two Response personnel on the ground in Kotzebue, they have contacted the North West
             Arctic Borough and are planning to fly to Kivalina this morning weather permitting.

             We will hold an interagency teleconference this afternoon with Borough , NWS, USACE, FEMA Area Office,
             DOT5PF, DI-155, AVEC, Red Cross, Red Dog Mine , and USCG.

             We have received word that Kivalina has declared a local disaster, and the North West Arctic Borough is
             planning to declare a disaster.

             More details as we get them.



             We are "Ready to Serve"
