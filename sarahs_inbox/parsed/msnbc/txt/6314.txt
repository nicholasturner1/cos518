          Mike - did Bitney ever write the letter in reponse to those writing to our office, telling
          us to call the special session - and then the response to Speaker Harris' letter asking
          the same? With new "demands" coming from some legislators and speculation from so many
          now - it sounds like those responses never made it to approriate persons (ie the
          Legislators).

          I have leggies patiently (but losing patience)        asking me "when" - I keep telling them it
          still should be in October.

          If those letters weren't written, we need to do so now . Telling them what the plan is.
          It's only fair to them ( and the public ) to let them make their plans that month . They'll
          also need this time to be doing their own research on ppt. A letter to the leggies today
          let's the media /public get wind of it and it addresses the rumors and puts them to rest.

         Thanks Tibs!
