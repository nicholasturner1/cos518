              Just to confirm, the Congressional delegation is supportive.  We have been working closely
              with them on this. The Senate deletion was an unpleasant surprise for everyone.



              I don't know whether this letter is worth a press release on a slow news day.                  Perhaps, we
              should wait to see the final result.

              Subject: Draft Letter to U.S .    Senate Finance Committee from 5 Governors




              Governor:




              The DC Office has advised that when the Senate passed HR 3997 last

              month , it stripped out some language several states       ( including Alaska)

              supported related to veterans mortgage bonds.



              Specific to Alaska , language was stripped out that would have raised the

              federal cap on the amount of tax exempt veterans mortgage bonds that

              could be issued by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation .         AHFC's

             veterans mortgage program is in danger of running out of funds for

              lending if Congress does not increase the cap.



             Several other states are - in a similar position or have other language

             changes they want Congress to pass into law .         The House Ways and Means

             Committee is planning to try and force the Senate to consider the bill

             again with the provisions back in it.



             These states have drafted a letter to the Chair and Ranking Minority

             Member of the Senate Finance Committee and are asking Governors from

             several states to sign the letter this Monday. With your approval, I

             will work with Larry Persily to get your signature electronically put

             into the letter so it can be delivered to the Senators this coming

             Monday.


                                                               2




                                                                                                          PRA GSPO1_0008647
