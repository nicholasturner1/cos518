          Man, that gossip crap bugs me. Any time it has anything to do with home or family, its
          irritating . Maybe she knows that though.

          I'll call Sheila - againt




          She knows there is an easy explanation for this stuff- but she chooses to run with it.
          She knows that if she calls me on these issues - 99 percent of the time they wouldn't make
          it in.

          Oh brother ...     I'm so sorry!




         For the plumbing project the dishwashing and pantry areas will have demolition work to
         walls and ceilings in order to access the old pipes , etc... The House china and stemware
         needed to be packed up and stored by professional movers, to ensure that they' d be safe as
         the cabinets need to be removed. They should be in storage for about a month , then we'll
         have the moving van again.




         I'm sorry that made the news ; I can have them park in the back and they can carry boxes
         down a flight of stairs and out the back instead of just going out the front door. It's
         worth it, to avoid giving anyone more ammunition.




         The thought crossed my mind, but I didn ' t think someone would be so hard pressed to
         include that in the ear. Did they not notice all the cars around the House? The Wolfson
         contractor van and other workers' vehicles from the window project , or the Simplex Grinell
         vehicle fixing the security cameras , or Silverbow Const . or Harri's Plumbing trucks parked
         outside working on the plumbing - nope, just the WWM van.




        Major problems in this 95 year old House are being addressed and it's crazy that they're
        using the van as something to take a jab at you with.

        Sheeeesh - for what it's worth - I have no idea why a moving van was at the mansion last
        week . Too bad Shelia Toomey didn't call us, or Erika, to find out before she printed the
        Ear blurb.
