               Governor, attached below are Ed Fogel's quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right
               away. Ruth is already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to
               decide the right course of action.

               We still feel that DEC, Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


     I         To: Tom, Marty,

               The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several
               specific examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other
               election statutes, and a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the
               ballot measure should have some level of agreement to our website.

               The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website
               language that is mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that
               they find objectionable. We have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm
               tomorrow. the Commission will either then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

               The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state
               officials cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at
               2:00. The Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.

               Ed

                We can't have an amount until after the end of August. There are earnings numbers
                that don't close until August 31. We have everybody lined up to do in a 36 hour period
                what is usually spread over about a week. Permanent Fund Corp is ready to quickly
                give us their numbers on Sept. 2, then they go through a series of calculations and
                authentications. At turbo speed this year, we should have the check amount by the end
                of the day on the 3rd.

                Just to keep expectations in line, we think ADN has over -estimated this year. Their
                $2100 estimate was a surprise. The PFD will probably not exceed $2050. But it's like a
                Christmas present, it doesn't do any good to set your hopes on a certain amount; just be
                happy for whatever you get.

                I believe they will know the amount on Sept. 4-6. We've been discussing the public announcement event
                and were trying to coordinate it with your travel schedule and had been talking about doing the event on
                Monday, Sept. 8. So they will already know the amount before the 8th.

               All,

               The governor would like to sign the energy rebate bill in Kenai this Saturday . She would also like the LG to be present.

               Let the other side have space on the website for rebuttal. And I'll forgo my First Amendment rights until
               the critics chill and I can once again express my personal opinion when asked...
               Thank you

               Governor, attached below are Ed Fogel's quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right away. Ruth is
               already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to decide the right course of
               action.

              We still feel that DEC, Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


              To: Tom, Marty,

              The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several specific
              examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other election statutes, and
              a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the ballot measure should have some
              level of agreement to our website.

              The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website language that is
              mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that they find objectionable. We
              have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm tomorrow. the Commission will either
              then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

              The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state officials
              cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at 2:00. The
              Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.
