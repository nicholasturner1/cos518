            Thank you for coming to the West Anchorage High School Auditorium re-opening last night.
            It was nice to see you and your family there. I hope that your daughter is enjoying her
            high school experience at West High School. Please keep in touch if there is anything
            that we can do for her and your family.   Thank you
