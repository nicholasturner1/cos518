                 To:        Governor Sarah Palin
                 Cc:      Michael Tibbles ; Sam Bishop; Kris Perry
                 Subject: NGA/Natural Resources Committee

               We have been advised that the best way for you to communicate your interest in
               becoming the next Chair of NGA's Natural Resources Committee is for you to contact
               personally the incoming Chair and Vice Chair of NGA.

               Accordingly, set forth below are the coordinates for Governors Rendel and Douglas,
               respectively. The information is a bit disjointed, but it's the best we can obtain from
               their staffs.

                         Governor Rendel -

                                     Anne Shriver (Personal Assistant) - 717.787.2500 -
                                              astate.pa.us
                                     ashriverl?
                                     Fax - 717.772.3155


                         Governor Douglas -

                                     109 State Street, Pavilion
                                     Montpelier, VT 05609.0101
                                     Phone - 802.828.3333
                                     Fax - 802.828.3339

                If you would prefer not to call them, I could put together a short note from you that
                could be emailed or faxed. In the alternative, I could call their staff people to
                express your interest, but this probably wouldn't be as effective as the
                other options.

                Please let me know how you would like to proceed.


               Please note that my email address has changed . My new email address is
