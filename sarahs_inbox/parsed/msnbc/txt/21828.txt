                  Governor:
                  We got some internal wires crossed and I didn 't realize that someone else was working on a speech.
                  Here's a draft copy that Talis Colberg has reviewed.

                  If the Lt. Governor, or Kate , has any suggestions or edits, they can send to me and I'll get you a final
                  copy.
