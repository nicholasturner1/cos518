           Jerry Beale was suppose to read proclamation on your behalf and should have been at event
           with it. I even talked with Gen. Campbell who had spoken earlier to Jerry at ANC event.
           I had been trying to locate Jerry this afternoon and have not been able to - Janice

           Not sure what happened - I waited til the last minute and no proclamation showed up... so
           to improvise the me found a poem, handed it to me, I took a chance and read it instead of
           the missing proclamation (which was noted on the printed agenda that the Gov's
           Proclamation would be read) - let's hope it didn't offend vets or military personnel who
           were there to be honored.

            Governor - just talked with McHugh and he will give Jerry a heads up that you will be at
            the 1:00 Wall to read Proclamation. Jerry has Proclamation and will be on the lookout for
            you.  Janice
