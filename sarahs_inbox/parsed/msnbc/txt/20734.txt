              Dear TC Department,

              Please forward this message to your supervisors.

              I work at Campbell Elementary School. In my building alone three teachers (Sarah Hooker, Amanda Sparks
              and myself, Julie Grant) are waiting for their yellow cards to accept contracts from the Anchorage School
              District. Our 18 days to teach in a classroom without certification is up on September 8. We have all
              experienced the same lack of customer service regarding phone calls and e -mails that have been ignored or
              answers that are non-responsive. Your department does not provide a free service to Alaska's teachers. In
              fact, a certificate costs about a day's salary.

              The three of us are frustrated and we feel helpless. Our lives are truly in limbo waiting for our "yellow
              cards." We are without job security, insurance and the tights of contracted teachers.

              I have had my certificate renewed before. It took two weeks. When I had questions regarding my
              application a representative helped me immediately by phone. The current situation of your department is
              so outrageous it deserves to be investigated. The hardship this has caused me and other teachers in my
              position is extreme. If this situation is not rectified to my satisfaction by Friday, September 5, I will contact
              an attorney to represent my interests as well as the news media . I now realize that I have teachers in my
              own building with the same issues. I'm quite certain with a little more investigating I will find a news
              worthy story to present to the local news media. With all eyes on Alaska's politics this isn't a good time.

              Teachers are a valuable resource and they deserve to be treated with respect
              Sincerely,
              Julie Grant
             Privileged or P

              Are you capable of answering simple questions? You have had my application for nearly three weeks. I just
              want to know that it is in a pile of applications to be processed. How much longer do You expect it to take
              to process applications received on August 15? I am sure you have the ability to estimate.

              Let me lay out a plan for you to take to your supervisors:
              1. Applications received should be stamped with the date received.
              2. A clerk or a receptionist should open all incoming applications and check them for completeness
              3. Incomplete applications should be returned immediately to the sender for completion
              4. Complete applications get logged into the database as pending/received- yellow card status
              5. Cash checks and run credit cards- based on the numbers Meredith gave you are collecting about
              $250,000 in revenue
              6. Separate renewal applications from new certificate applications
              7. Place one team on renewing applications and one team on new certificates.

              In my estimation it should take five minutes maximum to check an application for completeness. A clerk or
              a receptionist can process applications for pending status.

              Instead of blaming this problem on me, take some responsibility for your work. I am not the only teacher
              in a holding pattern waiting for your department to process our applications.

              Your emails have not been ignored. We're replying to emails that we receive . There could be a possibility that
              your email was filtered by our spam filter. It is required to be set on the highest level due to the large amount of
              spam mail that comes into this email.

              We are only able to acknowledge receipt when the application has been reviewed , however, it seems that you
              have postal confirmation of receipt, so you may go by that . Applications are considered effective as of the date a
              complete application is received.

              We did look up your file and notice that you are renewing a certificate. Please note that we always suggest that a
              renewal is submitted six months in advance of the expiration date. In your case, we would have accepted your
              application as early as February.

              I have sent numerous e-mails to your office that have been ignored, so have my phone calls- I do have the records. I have
              had direct contact with Meredith Boman and Commissioner Ledoux . I have sent a-mails to Governor Palin 's office. I have
              asked repeatedly for confirmation that my application was received by your office . That request has been ignored,. even
              when my a-mails have been answered . I want to know that my application is in the pile . The post office delivered it 18 days
              ago. I want to know what week of applications you are working on currently.

              I am furious that this process has taken so long. It is outrageous that anyone should have to wait this long to get answers that
              are not helpful. This hold up has caused an enormous hardship in professional and personal life.

              Please answer my questions.
