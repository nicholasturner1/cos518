             How did Sean C. think to do a story today in ADN on your solicitation of outside PR firm?
             And are all local firms excluded?



             Wondering how it became a story today, who called him.

                Governor, et al.

                I'm happy to talk to Sean about this. It appears to me that he's deliberately played up the PR angle in
                spite of our abundance of caution in discussing the outreach effort with him. Bruce and I repeatedly
                explained to him the difference between hiring an expert in communications and launching a PR
                campaign, including the use of examples. I'm very disappointed in Sean and the ADN. It's clear that
                Sean was intent on using the term PR despite its inaccuracy.

                Sharon, Bruce - the gasline communications team should contact Sean this morning and express our
                disappointment. What he's done is dishonest. Let me know your availability.

                Sharon- gasline team is very disappointed that someone contacted ADN to spin the "PR" firm story into something
                negative. I need you to discreetly find out who talked to Sean C about this and released it as a negative story. I have
                a feeling who may have done it, to make the gasline team look bad, but I need proof of it so I can deal with it.
