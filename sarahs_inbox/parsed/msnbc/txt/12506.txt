           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,

           I have heard so many good things about you and your values, etc., that I urge you to
           accept the position of Vice President on the Republican ticket, if asked. Hopefully, Sen.
           McCain will be sharp enough to consider you.

           I wish you the best of everything in all you endeavors.

           God Bless You!

           Pastor Rob Bremer - Gatlinburg,        Tennessee
