           Ha!  Alex thought I sounded WAY too happy to hear from him when he was just getting back
           from, practice!! He felt bad 'cause he realized later that you thought he was Track!    :)

           Night!

           Oh! At first I thought it was Track and that he was surprising me by saying he was putting
           Dad on the phone for me! That was funny.

           Governor,



            Alex thought I was working late at the House and I think he called and got you...
           Thinking it was HIS mom- he gave the phone to Brent- who thought my friend & I were joking
           with him- Brent was thoroughly confused... so he hung up. So if that's the strange call
           you got just a bit ago... sorry about that- it was my goofy family.



            I can't wait to see your kids & mom tomorrow!



            Erika
