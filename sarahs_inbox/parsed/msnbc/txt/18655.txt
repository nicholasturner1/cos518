              Here is the 5pm version to compare . Beaudo in this segment continues to speak to them as "fires" not flares,
              maybe I'm splitting semantics here. However the 2"d piece of the transcript below mentions BP 's take that they
              are "actually a flare of crude that was cleared by a cleaning pig in a feeder pipeline ." Don't know if this is helpful
              or not to you experts!

           Governor,  I thought a lot about whether I should pass this on but decided you would want
           to see what the conservation side is thinking. I don't agree with all the comments but a
           lot matches our thoughts and I respect Kate. Tom
