              I listened to the video. Here's the opening dialogue between you, Kyle
              Hopkins, and Sen. Stevens:

              KH: Governor, your appearance here was kind of a surprise today. Can you tell
              me about how that came about and whether we should see that as kind of an
              endorsement for Sen. Stevens for re-election?

              Gov: Well, it's um... I'm on the clock and we're in a Federal Building, so we
              won't talk about campaigns or endorsements, all that comes later, but I
              support the Senator's proposals here and his passion to again allow Alaska to
              be heard and to lead with an American energy policy that has been - I believe
              - sorely lacking.  And it is time to step up, work together, others are
              looking to us, to see how we are going to work together through this energy
              crisis and from here, forward, so I'm honored to get to be here and certainly
              an entire team working with us, we are going to be able to create the best
              solutions all working together. So, I'm honored to get to be here with him.

              Sen: No, no, no announcements will be made here about                  political
              announcements won't be made in this room.

               Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment . I'll askSharon to
               check on what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check. I
               said weeks ago "this isn't the time " in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate. Those
               who were with me at the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

              don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote
              you from ted ' s energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth
              coming.  don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try
              to further shove a wedge between you and ted .   just wanted you to be aware.

                            Ending Stock Market Manipulation
                            By Tom Donohue, President and CEO

                                             `Naked short selling" and the impact of manipulative behavior on investors and
                                             markets has been big news recently. Unfortunately, there's also been a lot of
                                             misinformation about what it really means for investors.

                                             First, remember that legitimate short selling is a good thing . it is simply a bet
                                             against the future value of a stock, and it helps markets deflate 'irrational
                            exuberance.'

                            But people who make bets sometimes by to cheat.

                                                                                                      >> Join the conversation.

                                     Chamber's ILR Highlights 'Tangled Web' of Lawyer Earmarks
                                     Trial lawyers are using legislation in Congress to create a tangled web of earmarks
                                     that would allow them to file more lawsuits , according to the U.S. Chamber's Institute
                                     for Legal Reform (ILR).


                                     Chamber Gears Up for Fight on Bill Expanding Discrimination Claims
                                     In a dose and partisan vote , the House Education and Labor Committee on July 24
                                     approved the Fair Pay Act, a bill that would radically amend the Equal Pay Act and
                                     increase employers' exposure to discrimination lawsuits . The Chamber is working to
                                     ensure that Congress does not pass this harmful legislation.

                                     Chamber-Backed Highway Funding Bill Advances
                                     The U.S. Chamber on July 24 applauded the House for passing legislation to transfer
                                     $8 billion from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund , which finances much
                                     needed surface transportation projects.
