             Governor:



             Kohanic Broadcasting is requesting to list you as an "honorary" co-host for its Native Art
             Auction.




             We have already regretted your attendance on Feb. 27 due to scheduling, so you are NOT
             required to attend..

             This would be a show of support for the organization.



             Also listed as "honorary co-hosts" for this year's event are: Sens Murkowski and Stevens,
             Rep. Young and Mayor Begich.



             For last year's event, all of the same individuals were listed as co-hosts, but you were
             the only one to actually attend.



             Beth Leschper

             Deputy Communications Director

             Office of the Governor

                                                                     1
