           MESSAGE:

           Good afternoon Governor,



           I was happy to hear about your pregnancy!



           I am an American living abroad (I lived in Alaska 10 years ago) and I will be voting for
           Senator McCain this fall. My mother, aunts and grandmother would be willing to vote for
           Senator McCain if he selects you as his running mate.



           Could you please ask Senator McCain to consider you as his Vice Presidential choice?



           God bless,



           Kristofer D. Lorelli
