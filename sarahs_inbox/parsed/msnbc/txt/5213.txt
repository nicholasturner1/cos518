                 Run the names by Tibbles and a few others first - including perhaps Balash ? These guys know where the
                 landmines might be, then work with Meg on getting the names out.

                 Remember - it's important to nip in the bud any criticism we'd get with so many Valley and Kenai names
                 - obviously there was no regional balance in the past - areas outside of Anch. (and Juneau?) were poorly
                 represented on these boards, previously. We want ALL ALASKANS represented...

                 Governor Palin and Mike,
                 Do you want to do one general press release with all of the appointments requiring legislative
                 confirmation or separate press releases for some of the more high profile boards such as Judicial
                 Council?
                 I can start passing on any information for some of the confirmed appointments to the press office if press
                 release(s) are going out.

                 Thanks,

                 Ivy Frye
