                I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State . I wanted to get you something for the 2008
                speech before the end of 2007 . Anyway , let me know if you think it is on the right track.

                1 thought I would take a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow . On Wednesday , I thought I would
                have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry Persily help me fact check and test sensitivity and
                direction . There are some items in the draft that have not been made public yet . Two examples are Habitat and
                Health Care reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out.

                Last year' s speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long . I tried to keep it shorter this time. This draft is now
                3800 words , hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was shooting for.

                Happy New Year!

                Mike

                   Subject: Cook Inlet LNG Settlement information (in draft form)

                 Governor, All,
                 Attached are "d    ' documents that will be useful for the Cook Inlet LNG Settlement press conference
                 scheduled for Thursday, January 3'd, at 12 noon. Attached are:

                1) Governor's Talking Points -'strawman" Opening Statement.
                         We propose that your opening comments be followed by Opening Statements from:
                         a. Conoco Phillips (made by Jim Bowles , President ConocoPhillips, AK);
                         b. Marathon Oil (made by Steve Hinchman, Sr. V-P Worldwide Production, out of Houston); &, tentatively,
                         c. Enstar, or Semco Energy/parent company of Enstar (made by Gene Dubay, Sr V-P of Operations, out
                         of Michigan)
                2) Settlement/Agreement Overview (a brief description of the agreement reached between the SOA, CP & MO); &
                3) Questions & Answers document (addressing questions/issues that may arise during or after the press
                conference.)

                As I've noted, these are draft documents that are still being worked on by the team, however, I thought you might
                like the opportunity to spend some time on them before the press of the week truly starts.

                Please note that we are proposing that you and the principals from the two companies make Opening
                Statements. Then we are thinking that the negotiating team members respond to any questions. However, we
                are open to whatever structure you would like, so please advise what works for you. The Opening Statements
                from CP and MO are still being developed. Once I have them in hand I will forward them to you. I am told they
                intend for their comments to be briefer than yours.

                One final note, the Settlement Agreement is to be signed by the Dept of Law, DNR and by the two companies.
                We intend to sign this agreement sometime before the press conference , perhaps on Wednesday morning.

                Thanks again,
                Marty
