           Hi




           I heard that you recently gave birth to a baby with down syndrome.For me to hear such
           things is very interesting since i also gave birth to a baby with downs on June 27 2007.MY
           baby is lovely and doing wonderful.Thank g-d.



           I don't know what its like in alaska but here in N.Y. city they are trying to                cut E.I.
           services.so they give to pple. twice a month family training.Which is causing                a big
           problem.Since no good Therapist wants to take on such a case .and a baby with                d.s. stays
           with out a therapists.either they should give once a week or no family traing                at all.



           i know that you are not my governer but since you can know relate to me,and you do have a
           stronger word than me please try to do something about.



                                  Thanks
