             Thank you Randy. She sort of shifted her rant from one thing to another in the three (or
             more) communications we've all had with her. Doesn't sound like she had any correct
             information from the start, or has chosen to go on misinformation to justify her anger.

            Governor:




            I spoke with Mrs. Kozloff yesterday. She said she has been speaking with several friends
            who are union members and that is where she got her information. She said her main
            concerns were really overcrowding in the prisons and understaffing of corrections
            officers.  I explained to her that we are working towards adding 1500 beds with the new
            Mat-Su prison and that we should be adding 40 officers. She said that was very helpful
            information for her to know and seemed very thankful for the call. She said she was still
            not sure everything was OK with corrections so I let her know she could meet with Joe or
            talk with him on the phone. She said she appreciated that, but it would not be necessary.
