           I'll meet whenever you deem it most appropriate- I'll let janice know april 15 is the
           recommendation. By then we should have solutions presented and many angles covered (ie.
           Legal advice, public safety concerns addressed, etc), I would hope. Thanks



           Also- pls include Rhonda in the loop on the solutions that are being sought here. I can
           ask Kris to work with her in Anchorage office on doing as much background info gathering
           as she can, so she can help advise.

           Dear Governor Palin,

                 I think this would need to be more than a few moments .               How about April 15 in
           Anchorage two days after the session ends?

             Of course we need to meet on this asap. Janice can put on sched whenever you need to meet
             with me. This is a volitile situation and I will need Walt and others to have solutions
             presented when we meet, instead of a briefing on what the continued problems are. Also,
