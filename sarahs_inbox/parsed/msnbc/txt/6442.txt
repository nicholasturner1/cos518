             Subject: HOT! Issuing AGIA' Amended RFA & Press Release!

             Governor,

            As requested I want you to know that we are in the process of issuing the attached press release and
            simultaneously posting the amended RFA to the AGIA' website. The press release has been discussed
            with the COS, Joe Balash, the Lt. Governor and the two Commissioners. I also want to thank you for
            allowing the extension to the RFA application deadline. The Gasline Team believes this deadline
            extension to be absolutely necessary to ensure.maximum participation in the AGIA' competitive process.
            Marty R
