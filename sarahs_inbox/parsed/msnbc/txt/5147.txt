                  Subject: Legislative Confirmation Deadline

                Governor Palin and Mike,

                I just wanted to let both of you know that the deadline for all board appointees that require legislative confirmation
                is February 14th. I wrote in my memo that it was February 16th, however I was mistaken . I have it on my
                calendar.
