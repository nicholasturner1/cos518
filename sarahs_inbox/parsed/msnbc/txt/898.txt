Hi Frank, I started work on Monday the 25th. I

appreciate your efforts and checking on how things are

going. This has been a grind for me and the folks at

DOT. I saw Sarah at the AOC Banquet in Anchorage on

the 9th and I saw her at the Iron Dog Banquet here on

the 16th. I talked to Sarah and Todd and it looked

like he was very uncomfortable with his broken arm.

How is he doing? Let us know if you have a free

evening in Fairbanks - we'd like to have you up for

dinner. We have ten Golden Retriever puppies in the

garage - I am constantly cleaning up poop! Keep us

posted and thank you again for being so helpful. Tom
