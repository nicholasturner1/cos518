            Governor,



            I wanted to draw your attention to an item on tomorrow's agenda for the Fort Richardson
            Memorial Ceremony.  Fort Rich officials would appreciate it if you'd arrive at the gate at
            9:35 (or 9:40 at the latest) so that you could spend a few minutes (5-10 at the MOST) with
            General Stephen Layfield before heading out to the event (Bob will meet you and get you
            through the gate and to the exact location of the event, as well as to where you would
            meet the general...I've included directions, too, just in case ). This is proper protocol,
            for the two highest ranking officials to meet beforehand. The two of you will head out to
            the event at approximately 9:55 - again, protocol requires that only you and the General
            walk down the center lane to the event (everyone else will approach on the perimeter).



            Also, I've triple-checked, and your role is to attend only - I have provided brief remarks
            for you, just in case. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. Thanks so
            much,



            Kate Morgan
