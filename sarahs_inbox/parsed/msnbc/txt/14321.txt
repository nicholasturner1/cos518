          Steve and Tom Irwin are working on it. I haven't heard anything about the state kicking in
          $25million for Juneau- that would make no sense when Juneau is just tasting a bit of what
          rural, and Fairbanks, and other areas have been going through. Do you mind if I forward
          your email to the energy guys? I can't articulate how important I feel this issue is to be
          addressed... tax relief and doing something with our royalties to provide the resource
          owners (the people!) relief is top, top priority for me. Thanks- let me know if I may
          forward.

          I am sitting in the FAI airport waiting to see if I'll be able to get a flight back home
          tonight. Thought I'd pass along some feedback from Fairbanks residents that will probably
          serve to confirm what you already know.



           1. Very hot environment on high energy costs.

           3. Economy clearly suffering due to high energy costs.
