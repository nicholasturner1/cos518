             Subject:                 Barrow tomorrow


              I'm zipping up to Barrow for a one-day trip to meet w/Mayor Itta and see some whaling
              celebration, etc. I'll have Ivy ask around about potential boards and commissions members.
              If there are any issues for me to be aware of that are timely for Itta feel free to let me
              know.
