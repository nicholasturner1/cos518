            Meghan and Sharon:

            Here is the resume and cover letter for Erik Drygas , Governor Palin 's potential appointment to the Board of
            Regents. As you know , she'll make the announcement at the Fairbanks Rotary Luncheon this week.

           Erik confirmed today he 's interested today , although he doesn ' t know that he's the top candidate . After I let him
           know he's appointed ( unless SP wants to call), do you guys want to get him the location and time information or
           do you want me to take care of that ? Also, I'll be sure to let him know we're still keeping all of this under wrap.

           Just let me know if you need anything else from this end.

           Thanks guys,

           Ivy Frye
