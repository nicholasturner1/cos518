             Yes, I've been working with Troy Carlock on a couple of dates . It will likely be latter
             part of November . Once finalized , I'll let everyone know.

             K-pls provide janice today's sched for the record- principal's speech, mcBride mtg, harris
             mtg, etc.



             Also, i still need to see any tentative events/invitations so i can start picking and
             choosing what I can attend, to allow me plenty of time to prepare for events, esp the
             speeches. Thanks.
