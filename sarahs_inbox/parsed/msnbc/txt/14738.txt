          Larry- don't let me forget as we scour the budget this week that I'll need your input on
          the leggies' inclusion of the $2 million for Harris and Green's polar bear conf. (Written
          about today in ADN).

          but when you help scrutinize the budget for DEC-impacts, pls let me know on this one.
          Thanks
