         I will look into the com name. I hope whomever it is who's been holding on to. the name
         hasn't had to pay for it. Who is it?

         Sarah,



         I have some friends that have been keeping sarahpalin.com from enemy hands. It needs to
         be renewed.  They would like to keep it (but need whatever the cost is to do that), or
         give it to you. What should I say?



         Thanks

         Glen
