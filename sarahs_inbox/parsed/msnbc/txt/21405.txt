              MESSAGE:

              Hi Sarah,

                 First off I wanted to tell you Congratulations! The last time I was in Alaska I saw
              signs indicating that you were running for governor. Someone that I was speaking with
              earlier just made me think to see what the outcome had been.




              I'm actually not even sure if you remember me, but my maiden name was Grieve when I spent
              time with you and your family one summer out in Bristol Bay. I was 16 at the time and had
              been recommended by my cheerleading coach, Marilyn Lane, for babysitting purposes. At the
              time , Willow was just around a year old . It's crazy to see how much they've grown from
              the photo on your website. I see you still like to fishing in Bristol Bay. :)



              I am actually now an attorney in the State of Washington for DSHS .   I also recently got
              married this past summer which was huge .   I would really love to hear your
              ideas / strategies on getting into politics and hope that you would even have time to spare
              to give me a call or drop me a line.



              I hear you' re doing a great job and say hi to Todd, Track, Bristol, and Willow for me.




              Marie
