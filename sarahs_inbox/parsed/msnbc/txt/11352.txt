             Hello!



             I've e-mailed a number of times regarding Gov. Palin getting on our radio stations once or
             twice a month ( at her liesure ). Maybe to talk about what state topic she is focusing on
             at the time. I would appreciate some kind of response so I can try and plan for this.



            We have four stations in Fairbanks . They are KIAK - FM, KAKQ-FM , KFBX - AM, KKED-FM. We
            would love to be able to talk with the Gov. about whatever she would like to discuss.




            Please let me know if this is doable.



            Thank you,



            Nick Seekatz
