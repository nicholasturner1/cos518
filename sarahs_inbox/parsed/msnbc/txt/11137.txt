              Whatever day Todd was in office--Thurs or Fri--bec he and I heard it same time around time
              Sharon was dealing with how to respond...ie. Do we write a letter... conclusion was we be
              straightforward and talk about Track serving our country, you want to see him
              graduate.. .so as to timing-post fundraiser on Sharon's end but she heard it from someone
              in JNU governor's office I believe so don't know when they knew.

              ADN is reporting "we" knew the 6pm was going to be a problem a week ago (I did not),
              leaving the impression I could have changed flights. Who knew it was a problem a week ago?



              Also says I "refused" to give a reason for wanting 6pm so both House and Senate said 7pm.
              Who "refused" to give reasons (unless Bitney is spreading this, to cover his butt for not
              working with his boss-Harris- on this back in December)?
