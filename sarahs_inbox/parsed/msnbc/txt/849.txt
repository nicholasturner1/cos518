  Hi Todd,

  How would you like me to handle the PSA for the Alaska Trails ATV Safety Project? They
  asked if you were available the week of January 28 -February 1st. I hadn' t heard back from you
  in regards to the dates, so was checking to see if you had spoken directly to them.

  PSA INFORMATION:
  One day film shoot- Best dates available for filming are January 28th, 29th, February 5th
  or 6th.

        . Big Lake or Wasilla would be great for filming. If there is a particular place that Todd
          will be or recommends, please let us know.

        . Is there a friend / racing partner that would like to be in the shoot as well? Family
           members are most welcome, as well. If Governor Palin or the kids wanted to be in one
           scene, they could be written into the script. It's Todd's choice.

 Thanks,
 Erika

 Hi Erika-

 I met with the creative director & production manager today of the film crew for the PSA. I
 wanted to share some information and questions they passed to me.

   Hello Jillian,

   I have emailed the second set of dates to Mr. Palin and I'm sure that I'll here back from him when he
   returns, as he is currently traveling outside the state.

   Don't hesitate to call or email if you'd like to follow up on this; it's not a bother.

   Thank you,
   Erika

      Erika-

      The PSA will b e shot outside, to account for this and hope for good weather and light
      we are blocking out
      one week, but the filming would only take one day. To maximze daylight hours, we
      are focusing on the week of February 6-13.

      Please let me know his availability and flexibility in this timeframe.

      Thank you.

          Ms. Fagerstrom,

          I am writing today to seek assistance from Todd Palin to aid us in our
          mission of safer ATV riding for young Alaskans. Alaska Trails, in
          partnership with the Bureau of Land Management and National Park
          Se rvice, is responsible for creating ATV safety training for young
          people in Alaska. Our vision is to have Mr. Palin be a spokesman
          for responsibl e riding and wearing a helmet in a brief public service
          announcement for TV and/or radio. Mr. Palin is seen as a champion
          and his positive image could help us carry forth our mission and
          reach a wider audience.

          Thank you for your assistance . I look forward to your reply.

          Sincerely,
