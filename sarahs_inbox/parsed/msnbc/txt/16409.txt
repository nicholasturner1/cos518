              Subject: Timberland?




             I'm up and down O'Malley and haven't seen a Timberland nor a Timberlane yet. It's going on
             1.5 hrs after the function began so I'll give it another drive - if I don't see it on this
             pass I'll pull over and call a cab to just take me so I don't waste an afternoon and
             evening haven driven into Anchorage. Is there a phone number for Rep Johnson?
                                                                     1
