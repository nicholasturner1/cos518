                 Subject: Press Release Today - Gas LIST

               I have copied and pasted into the email the Gas List that came directly off the Governor's Calendar . There are
               missing months as the calendaring system that was used previously to July 1 , 2007 crashed and there is no back
               up to look at. Some calls may have not reached the calendar . If there is a way to go back to the Lt. Governor's
               Calendar for Dec. 2006 to see if we are missing meetings tcalls from that time it would be helpful and also the
               large May 15 - June 30 , 2007 missing dates. We may not want to quote numbers . Janice

                                      Governor's Meetings/Phone Calls ,/Gas Companies:

              DATES MISSING: Dec. 7 - 31,2006; May 16 - 31,2007; June 1 - 30, 2007 -                       This is due to
              the system crashing and having to convert to new Calendaring system.
