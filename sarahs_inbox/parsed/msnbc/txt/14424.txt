           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin and Family,

           Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, just had an article about your new son. We are so
           excited for you. God must hold you in very high regard to give you such exceptional
           blessings. Congratulations! 4 children!!

           Our son flys for Cathay Pacific, Los Angeles/Anchorage/Hong Kong route. His flight
           schedule will now be an excellent reminder to pray for you personally and for your
           wonderful family.

           Indeed, The Lamb Won.
