                 Governor,

                 I have traded phone messages with Sen . Tom Wagoner for weeks regarding Jeremiah Campbell on the Board of
                 Fisheries . I finally had a chance to talk to him yesterday at the bill signing . He wanted to know what we
                 concluded . Consistent with our last conversation , I told him that I did track down information from the Troopers.
                 Their report indicated that Jeremiah fully complied with the investigation , admitted that he made a clerical error in
                 signing the wrong paperwork. The troopers did not believe there was any intentional wrongdoing . I told him that
                 given the elapsed time and the low severity of the offense , we were not going to hold a hearing to remove him.
                 Going through a public hearing to unseat him this close to a Board meeting addressing Cook Inlet issues would
                 certainly look politically motivated and seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of the next meeting.
                 Obviously he was not happy but he knows there will be vacancies coming up and we can have the appropriate
                 conversation about board balance within that context.
