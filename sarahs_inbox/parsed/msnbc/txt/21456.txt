                  Bravo Company , 297th Support Battalion will leave Alaska at 12 : 35pm on 28 October from Elmendorf.
                  They will be boarding the planes at the Elmendorf Joint Mobilization Center.
                  It would be an honor to have the Governor and the Lt. Governor attend this event and shake the hands of
                  the Soldiers as they board the aircraft.
                  Please give me a phone call if you need any assistance.
                  Thanks,
