             MESSAGE:

             Hello.



               I apologize for the late timing of this note, but I wanted to share with you; I
             understand Governor Palin will be visiting Weller Elementary School in Fairbanks Friday,
             February 15 - and I wanted to point out that one of the teachers there, 3rd Grade teacher
             Mrs. Tanya Mendelowitz, was recently awarded "Junior Achievement Teacher of the Year
             2007-2008" in Anchorage.




               Dermot Cole, columnist of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner will be doing a story about
             this shortly, and wanted to point out that this could be an excellent photo opportunity!



               Thank you for your consideration.-



             Sincerely,

             Kade Mendelowitz
