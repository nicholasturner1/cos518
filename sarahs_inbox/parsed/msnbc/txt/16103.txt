            Governor - I noticed in the Itinerary it states that the family will

            follow Bob onto base. I have spoken to Bob this morning to double check

            and he knows that he is picking everyone one up at the hotel at approx.

            9:30 a.m. so that he can drive you. Thanks, Janice

            Pls send itinerary for bill signing and base tour event tomorrow. I need

            to consider who all I'll bring on base depending on what they want to

            show me in the limited time I'll have there before heading to the

            Carlson.
