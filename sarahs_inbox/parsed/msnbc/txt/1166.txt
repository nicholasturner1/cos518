MESSAGE:

Welcome to your son and congratulations. My oldest son is about to turn 20 and he is by far the
greatest of all G-d's gifts to me. He has changed everything in me and helped me see the power of
accepting what on the surface may seem a short-coming, only to discover a treasure chest of delight.
When I want to rush through things, he reminds me that I must take time out to offer him the pleasure
of showing me how better to spend our time. You will have so much joy ahead of you. Take the time
and enjoy. Sincerely, Carol Carreau (a resident of Atlanta with a brother in Kenai)
