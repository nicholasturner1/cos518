           What time is the A0 signing on Climate Change today? We'll need to let AP and other
           outlets know so Quinn can be there - there are lots of Alaskans waiting to hear what we're
           doing on Climate... this is a very good visual and public "first step" they've been
           waiting for. We know we've been working on it, but Alaskans don't know that yet. Thanks
