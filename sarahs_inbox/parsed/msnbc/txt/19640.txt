           Karen- you'll need to correct their misstatements on budget cuts asap.

           What does that mean ? Did Annette try to correct them?

           And ktva is reporting that now some officers may not be paid be "she cut their budget"...
           The leggies cut, we added.

                This is amazing.

           tomorrow if they want to talk with her.
