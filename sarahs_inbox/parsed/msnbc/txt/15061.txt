             Can we get the commencement speaker to note Talis' PhD accomplishment at tomorrow's UAF
             exercise ? I can have Ivy track down who that speaker is, he can surprise Talis with an
             "atta' boy" from the entire Palin/Parnell Administration... some kind of surprise like
             that to publicly and proudly send our congrats on Talis' accomplishment tomorrow!
