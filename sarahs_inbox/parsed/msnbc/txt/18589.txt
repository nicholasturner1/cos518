         Please review the album and if you wish that any of the images be

         removed please

         let me know and I will do so. Once I have heard from you I will then

         remove the

         pass word and make the album public. At that point feel free to pass

         the link along

         to friends and family.




         Just for information the email address you gave Britt and I did not

         work.    Would you

         please include in your reply as I would like to have it on file.



         Attached please find a copy of the image that I feel best represents

         the event.



         I would just like to add it was a pleasure to meet you the other day.



         Have a great day.
