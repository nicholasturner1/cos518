  Subject: shame

   Shame on you. This is NOT how Jesus would do things. Nothing secret, nothing self serving.

   Shame on you. Shame, shame, shame.

   She deletes her email addresses? What honor is there? Stand up for who you are, and hat you believe
   in.

   Its cowardice, pure and simple. Just like shooting a defenseless animal from a plane with a high
   powered rifle.

   Would Jesus do that? Getting elected at all costs is NOT hat he would do.

   Shame on you. Shame, shame , shame.




   Psssst...Have you heard the news? There's a new fashion blog, plus the latest fall trends and hair
   styles at StyleList.com.
