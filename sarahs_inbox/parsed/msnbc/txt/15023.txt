           MESSAGE:

           First of all congratulation's on the birth of your son. Well Shoreside Petroleum did it
           again.

           Unleaded is $4.79.9 per gallon Diesel is $5.49.9 per gallon and heating fuel is $4.92 a
           gallon. There has got to be something that can be done this is just plain old price
           gauging. All I here around town is the prices of everything and that people are thinking
           of moving away because they can't afford to live here anymore. At this rate Shoreside will
           have his loan paid off in a year like he had planned. Thank you Mary Lou
