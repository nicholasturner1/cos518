           I too am the mother of a special needs son.He is ajoy and a delight. He is also 28 years
           old. I applaud your attitud. I have worked in the disabilities field for over 40 years.
           Please let me know if there is something I can do. I can only say" YOu go, Governor
           Palin".

           Currently I provide resources and advocacy and run support groups.

           I can only say" you go, Governor Palin". It is my belief that we need to see the person
           first and the disability second.

           Take care

           Sincerely,

           Dani Feierstein
