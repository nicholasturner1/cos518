             I have just double checked with the Fairbanks organizers and you are definitely on the
             agenda for 2 minutes , short and sweet . We look forward to seeing you in Fairbanks.

             You are definitely only on the agenda for 2 minutes.



             I have the entire agenda in the briefing book, including names of both KEYNOTE and one
             other speaker during the lunch, for your review.



             We're completing the book now and should have to you shortly.

             Last year at this event I was asked to/expected to take up the whole hour . Are we SURE
             this is just a few minute event? I don't want to be caught off guard with an expectation
             of giving a Juneau update speech, or AGIA, or anything else unless I have time to prepare
             for such a thing.



             And I just found out king air is down, so travel to Fairbanks is still up in the air in
             terms of timing , driving up, getting out of here, etc.

             Here is a draft for your approval of the remarks for the Fairbanks Go Red Luncheon on
             Friday.



             I have a hard copy in the binder I'll give to Janice.

              I've checked the data with the American Heart Association and with our HSS epidemiologist
              in Anchorage.

             If it's pouring could we reschedule pod cast today? If it turns out to be anything like
             yesterday , I looked like a drowned rat the rest of the day after that outdoor photo shoot-
             and it was a long day with lots of events until very late evening... as today is too. Not
             a very pretty picture when I don ' t have time to go re - do anything after being in rain.
