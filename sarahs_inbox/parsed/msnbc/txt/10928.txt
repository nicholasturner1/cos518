            Governor:



            Here's a draft quote about the predator control information program for

           you to edit. F&G doesn't have a followup release drafted. But once we

           have something approved from you, I'll send it on so they can add it.

           We'll ask to review before it goes out.

           I need to give a quote on f and g's control release so it's known that I

           do support denby's efforts.
