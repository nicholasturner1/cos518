              I did catch this earlier. So, in a previous email to you and others, I mentioned
              that we had contacted the Congressional delegation within minutes of the
              press release. This was in accordance with the roll-out plan discussed the
              night before with various members of your staff.

              Therefore, it is true that the Congressional delegation did not get advance
              notice. The press release was issued at approximately lam in Alaska, and we
              advised the Congressional delegation through the usual channels shortly after
              11am, DC time.

              What is not true is statements made by Congressional delegation staff, and
              described by Robert Dillon in an FNM article, that they received no notice or
              read about the decision in the media.

              Whether right or wrong, the decision was made not to provide prior notice
             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



              Hope this helps.
