         Beth is drafting the speech. She did receive some information from Seamount and pulled
         some background information from the IOGCC website.  We spent some time Saturday going
         over the message and specific items to include in the speech. I will check in today to
         see how far along she is now. Our goal was to get you a draft early and we should be on
         track.

           Sorry, I got tied up, and didn 't see others' efforts - I edited substantially from the original , and including some
           major rewites and major deletions (comments on some points included).
