                 Hello Governor:)

                I wanted to tell you thank you for taking time to visit our Pipeline Training in Fairbanks. I had to leave
                shortly after I saw you at the meet and greet just before the bus tour, but I understand you were there for
                quite some time.

                Also, I will be hanging your Executive Proclamation in my office, sighting November as Apprenticeship
                Awareness Month.
                Commissioner Bishop presented that to four crafts at the graduation ceremony and I ended up with it
                and we are very proud of it.


                Thank you for all your support.
