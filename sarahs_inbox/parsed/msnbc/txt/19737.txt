           Dear Governor Palin; First, in regards to the media and those who are trying to stir
           things up, I think their motivation is despicable! We my wife Patty and I, believe in you
           Governor Palin. It saddens me to see and hear what has been going , because we care for
           you, and also because it is a distraction from what is really important to Alaskans. Where
           the tire hits the road.
