              Dear Governor Palin:




              Please refer to the following Army Times Article.

              I agree the Armed Forces personal were in the wrong to falsify hunting license
              information. However, I think this reflects poorly on the State of Alaska. Members of the
              Armed Forces rarely have any choice in their duty assignments and are moved often. Many
              are thrust from their normal cultural environment, and then placed at even greater
              personal risk. No Private/Airman/Seaman every got rich off his/her salary. So, I find it
              disconcerting anyone would make it harder to obtain what little enjoyment they might have.
              I hope the Citizens of Alaska might consider doing something similar to Michigan, and
              provide a discount to any'active duty member of our Armed Forces.
