              Subject: Lt. Gov. and Criminal Justice Working Group

            Governor.

           I met with the Commissioners of DPS , DOC, the AG, and the Lt. Gov. The Lt. Gov. agreed to chair a criminal
           justice working group. The first meeting will probably be in December . I am not sure when the Lt. Gov. wants to
           make a formal announcement.
