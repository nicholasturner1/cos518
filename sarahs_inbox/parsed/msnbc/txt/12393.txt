            Governor,



            Unfortunately, the Hamel letter is a pdf, and cannot be pasted. Hamel is in DC, as far as
            I_know.  Jonne will be in the office in 30 mina, and will provide a more detailed report
            to this group then, including a summary of the Hamel letter.



            In short, the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation (given its staffing
            limitations), and pushing BP very hard. PSIO has completed a thorough technical review
            that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak, and the
            final section of the report, an addendum addressing materials traceability, will be
            completed in the next day or two. We'll send it to Mr. Bewak directly and post it on the
            PSIO website.



            As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
            info, you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr. Hamel (I assumed that's why you
            asked where he is)



            Bruce
                                                                   1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0012522

            Subject: Latest Hamel Letter




            Per Chuck Hamel's request, I have attached his latest correspondence to Congressmen.
            Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier letter to the House
            Energy Committee.



            I.. would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



            P.S.

            Governor, in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with you during
            your DC trip.
