           Bruce- it's my understanding that you're still waiting for the go-ahead on hiring those
           whom you need to work on AGIA communications, which sounds like includes Meg as a part-
           timer. We're still interviewing for a full-time Comm Director, so Meg coming back on board
           part-time can be a great complement to a needed full-time Director once that person is
           found. In the meantime, pls work with Mike Tibbles and/or Mike Nizich to hire the person
           or persons you've been needing to complete the gasline team . I assume Meg is ready to
           return part-time?  Thanks
