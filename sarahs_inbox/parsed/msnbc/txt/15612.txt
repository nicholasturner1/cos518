            Governor,



            I have two final calls coming in re: ANC District Court from Reps. Dahlstrom and Kerttula.
              I'll put their comments together in the recap for Monday along with interview notes and
            the summary.  I think you have some great choices out of these applicants.



            Judge Michael Jeffery passed on his appreciation to you for appointing him again to Barrow
            Superior adding, "Please tell the Governor thank you.  We love it up here in Barrow."
