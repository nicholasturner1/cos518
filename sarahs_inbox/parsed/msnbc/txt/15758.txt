          I was watching a program on cnn about naturalm resources tapping in your state, but
          thatsnot why im writing, in writing you because we have something in common, a child with
          Downs Syndrome, i just wanted to let you know to encourage that child to do as much as he
          can do, do not limit his abilities. My doctorsm told me what my child would and woulndt do
          by such and such an age, but i worked with my daughter and she has surpassed all of those
          obstacles the doctors tossed at me, my daughter is now 13 years old, and graduatong
          tomorrow from 7th grade with honor. And the best thing you can don education choicewise is
          to let your child attend intergrated schooling, so that he can conform to the world as it
          will be when he grows up in it, i started my daughter off in special schooling but was
          very disappointed in-the program , simply because they didnt push the envelope in my
          childs abilities, but once chose regular education for her i was very impressed on how
          she blossomed. I just wanted

          to share that bit of encouragement, and know that your child is not handicapped, hes
          handicappable. Ebony Groomster of Ohio
