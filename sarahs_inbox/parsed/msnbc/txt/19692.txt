           From my understanding Randy has incorporated her comments / tone and prepared another draft
           since then . The deadline was missed, but Sharon said she thought this was taken care of
           before she left Anchorage so I've asked her to clear up the cluster w / Rosanne ( and Meg
           Holland ). We will get the polished statement to Meg tomorrow . Again, sorry as I was just
           venting about how all this went down and no matter how much I tried to resolve and help -
           it was still a cluster.

           Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and
           his claim that it was only four.

             I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting , every reception , every trip, phone
           call and face-to-face that I had with Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.

               Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.

               Also notable is all the mtgs / conversations he had with COS, Dep COS , Special
           Assistants , etc. And the fact he was NEVER refused any request to meet with any of us. He
           met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also , in "communications" with
           me.

              Hopefully all that ' s noted before she files her story.

           And pls pass on the Bill McA. What ' s his email addy?

               Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points . Thanks
