           MESSAGE:

          I just wanted to take a moment and thank you for the work you've done for the average
          alaskan family. In my lifespan I have seen many politicians and most I can't say much for.
          I finally have seen what a good person can do in a point of power and its refreshing to
          me. You have done more for the people in your short tenure than most will do in lifetime.
          You should feel commendable for that. I only fear that we will lose you to a higher level
          of government before your potential is met in alaska. I'm sure you meet great opposition
          from many of your peirs for your actions. Unfortunately many live in a tunnel vision.
          Seeing the future through the present is the Key! I have to say that until you reached
          office I had never voted because my ideals would never let me vote for the lesser of two
          evils. Since you've reached the seat in the capital I've become much more active in our
          greatest right. You have given the people of alaska a voice and shown big business that
          you will not bully the weak

            SO, in a nutshell I say Thank You! As honestly as anyone can.

              Hi R- the events this Saturday at the Gov's House , as hosted by the First Family, are historic. We do not believe they've ever
              been done before as Todd gathers former First Ladies for their tea ... plus we invited former First Ladies and their (grown)
              children to revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.
                Alaskans would like to know of this, I'm sure , so profiling it and/or allowing a photo op of these wonderful elderly Alaskan
              women as they gather here on Saturday would be great for historical reasons and for today 's public to witness.
                Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on it , as can historians in Juneau who
              can appreciate this unprecedented event ... and please remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for the current First
              Family to host this . Well all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with his Styker Brigade before
              their Sept deployment to Iraq.
                An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his blue collar Slope job to host the First
              Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of announcements ). Thanks!
               (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pis let Rosanne know so it can be cranked out today, then
              press can follow up.)

               Subject: Saturday

               Hi R- the events this Saturday at the Gov's House, as hosted by the First Family, are historic. We do not believe they've ever
               been done before as Todd gathers former First Ladies for their tea ... plus we invited former First Ladies and their (grown)
               children to revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.
                  Alaskans would hike to know of this, I'm sure, so profiling it and/or allowing a photo op of these wonderful elderly Alaskan
               women as they gather here on Saturday would be great for historical reasons and for today 's public to witness.
                  Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on it, as can historians in Juneau who
               can appreciate this unprecedented event... and please remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for the current First
               Family to host this . Well all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with his Styker Brigade before
               their Sept deployment to Iraq.
                  An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his blue collar Slope job to host the First
               Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of announcements ). Thanks!
                 (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pis let Rosanne know so it can be cranked out today, then
               press can follow up.)

              Kate- there's a great "First Ladies" video that was released two years ago. It gives the history and
              great perspective re: why we're hosting these events on Saturday. Pls watch that to help you craft
              message on the historical event(s). Thanks

                 R- If there are points you can be thinking about while traveling today pis plan on incorporating them
                 into the presser, I'll ask Kris to find a Statehood person (or other capable writers such as Patricia or
                 someone) and this can all be put together if, not today then tomorrow. Sharon is slammed so I won't be
                 asking her to do this one... pis let me know if you have other ideas on who can help craft this, including
                 getting a quote or two from participants like the former House Manager and/or other First Ladies like
                 Bella Hammond (whomever is easy to reach). Kate can assist on this- she's a great writer and
                 researcher... I'll cc her in. She can contact the current House Manager, Erika, and go from there.
