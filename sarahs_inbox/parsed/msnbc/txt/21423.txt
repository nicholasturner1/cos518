              I got a call from Cathie Roemmich this afternoon about your gasline team speaking at
              chamber next week. She said that there was miscommunication in her office and that her
              staff had accidentally booked Ralph Samuels on the same day. She asked my opinion and I
              told her I appreciated the call, but it was up to her discretion. I did point out that it
              would be two anti-ACES presentations in a row and she said that she would keep your team
              scheduled for next week. She thought I made a great point and asked that I convey to you
              that her chamber remains neutral : )



              Also, she put me at a front table at the chamber dinner on Saturday if Ms. Piper wants to
              sit by me while you address the crowd : )
