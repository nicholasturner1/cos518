               May 31 (ht p://www.whitehousegov/news/releases /2008/0 /20080531- 3.html) -- President Bush
               extolled students for "a resurgence of personal responsibility" and pushed them to continue their
               commitment to family , community, and country. "You're the 50th graduating class in the .history of
               the academy," the President noted before cadets in Colorado Springs. "Each of you is a volunteer
               who stepped forward to accept the burdens of war, knowing all the dangers you would face upon
               graduation. You willingly risk your lives and your futures so that out country can have a future of
               freedom and peace .... A nation that produces citizens of virtue, character, and courage like you can
               overcome any challenge and defeat any adversary ." Similarly, in Greenville, South Carolina: "I was
               impressed when I heard that neatly two-thirds of you balanced your academic studies this year with
               outreach to your community," the President said . "Through such works of compassion, you've
               learned early in life that nothing is more fulfilling than putting the needs of others ahead of your
               own.... And, as you leave this campus today, my call to you is this: strengthen this rising culture of
               responsibility by serving others , contributing to our civic life, and being accountable to yourself and
               your families."

               achievement, increased civic engagement, and positive character development -- and, in turn, feel more
               empowered and connected to their community . Through dedicated service, students can see how their

               NCLB UPDATE
               In a June 3 letter to Chief State School Officers
               (kitty://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/account /saa.html#peerreview), Assistant Secretary for Elementary and
               Secondary Education Kerri Briggs commended states for the work they have done to implement high-
               quality standards and assessment systems and furnished a fact sheet with information on the Department's
               standards and assessment system status designations and implications of those designations . As of now, the
               systems in 32 states have received "full approval" or "full approval with recommendations," while the
               systems in three states have been designated "approval expected" It is unlikely that all the remaining states
               will have fully approved standards and assessment systems by the end of the 2007 -08 school year.
               Moreover, some states that have approved systems may revise their standards or assessments in ways that
               result in systems that do not meet all No Child Left ft Behind requirements. Accordingly, the Department will
               continue its usual practice of designating states to reflect their level of compliance.

               Starting next week, The Achiever newsletter will be available solely online, providing a greater focus on how .
               successful schools across the U.S. are working toward the goal of the No Child Left BehindAct. to have every
               student reading and doing math at grade-level by 2014. The latest story, presented as a photo narrative,
               spotlights a Kansas school on a military base. At one time, Ware Elementary School was considered a
               chronically under-performing school . Today, as a result of specific reforms (detailed within), 99.6% of
               students are proficient in reading and 100% of students are proficient in math . And, Ware has exceeded the
               Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) goals for Kansas, earned a No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School
               designation, and received a Title I Distinguished School Award. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE

               On June 4, Secretary Spellings announced new awards under two discretionary grant programs administered
               by the Department's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools (OSDFS). First, she announced $24 million in
               grants to 92 school districts in 34 states to help them enhance and fortify their readiness and emergency
               management plans. Plans must address all four phases of emergency management: prevention-mitigation,
               preparedness, response, and recovery. Plans must also commit districts to: (1) coordinate with officials in
               local government, law enforcement, public safety, public health, and mental health; (2) train school officials
               in emergency management; and (3) supply a method for communicating emergency and reunification
               procedures to parents . Second, she announced $5.78 million in grants to 49 districts and other entities in 20
               states to develop and implement -- or expand -- school-based mandatory random or voluntary drug testing
               programs for students in grades 6-12. Projects must be part of a comprehensive drug prevention program
               in the schools served and cover the referral to counseling or treatment of students identified as users.
               Projects must also be consistent with constitutional principles and state and federal laws and ensure the
               confidentiality of testing results. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

               schools, compared with 4% of white students ; and, since 1970, women's undergraduate enrollment has
               increased more than three times as fast as men's . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

               QUOTE TO NOTE

               "[1lhe best way, by far, to improve economic opportunity and to reduce inequality is to increase the
               educational attainment and skills of American workers.... As we think about improving education and
               skills, we should also look beyond the traditional K-12 and four-year college system, as important as it is, to
               recognize that education should be lifelong and can come in many forms. Early childhood education,
               community colleges, vocational schools, on-the-job training, online courses, adult education - all of these
               are vehicles of demonstrated value in increasing skills and lifetime earning power."
