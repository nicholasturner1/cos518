             Not your fault at all . Thanks for the info - it helps me understand how the " process"
             works . Thanks



             I'll bet they don't understand what we go through with folks getting ticked if I don't
             show up, even tho we don ' t promise that we ' ll be there - even asking the questions sets us
             up for an obligation to attend.

             Governor - Security can view your calendar at any time . So, my take on this is that they
             are looking through your calendar and then notifying the event contacts listed to ask more
             about the event , etc. I would like to ask that they notify me first before notifying
             anyone on your calendar so that this does not happen in the future . I apologize about all
             of this . Janice

             Governor - West Valley was not notified ( as you had asked ) from me . This was an official
             invitation that was received and we did not want them notified as you wanted to just drop
             by and not make an official event out of this. I do not know why they were now notified
             and seats are reserved for you.



             Gary if there is someone that I need to talk to in this regards concerning the seating
             please let me know who was notified and the contact number . Thanks , Janice

             We wanted to make sure West High wasn ' t preparing for me - they get disappointed if I do
             show and it's just supposed to be a drop-by. Don't know if that got communicated, but it's
             what Janice did work on. (That's the problem with inquiring about details of events- folks
             then think I'm showing up.). Maybe Janice can add to this.



             Also, if I am able to swing by I doubt it'll be a party of four so don't want them to
             reserve seats unnecessarily. Thanks

             Governor,



             Jus trying to hep you here ...at your 6:00 pm event at the Egan please just pull up to the
             front of the building, Bob has arranged for parking and will grab the vehicle.



             Officials at West High expect full capacity, 1900 people. The event will last about 1
             hour and they have reserved 4 seats for you and guests. If you suspect you need more
             seats , please let me know so we can arrange. Bob again will assist with the car.




             On Monday I will take the suburban in to DOT for repairs to the door.



             Ring me if you need anything.

             Gary
