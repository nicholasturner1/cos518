                Subject: Secretary's Phone Call/Changed Time


               I was just advised that the Secretary is now scheduled to call the Governor at 12:30
               EDT rather than the original 1:00.

               I have attached Interior's polar bear press advisory for your ready reference. Sam'
               will cover the Secretary's press conference, and we'll report back on that. The
               Secretary's written comments will be posted on the web at approximately 2:40 EDT.
