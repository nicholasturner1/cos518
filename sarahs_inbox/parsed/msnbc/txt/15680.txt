            Looks pretty packed. I prefer having a minute or two to get there to the house, get my
            bearings (especially with Trig) and shift gears instead of going from the plane
            immediately into meetings. I had not counted on immediately meeting. What is Stevens'
            issue - don't plan on mtg without knowing what his beef is first
