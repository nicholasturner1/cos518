              Just a heads up that the producers have asked the Alliance to round up
              "about a dozen to 20 people" to fly down to Juneau to support the producers
              in a "last ditch" effort to get the changes wanted by the producers to the
              bill. I'm not sure of the arrival time yet. I just had a friend read the
              email to me from the Alliance. (I couldn't get it, however.)




             Ahhh... imagining that irresistible "new car" smell?
             Check out new cars at Yahoo! Autos.
