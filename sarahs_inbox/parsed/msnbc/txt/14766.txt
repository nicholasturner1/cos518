             I recently read about the birth of your 5th child . At the age of 43 I gave birth to my
             fifth child, a son with Down Syndrome . He also has Hirschsprung's Disease . Nathan is now
             11. Although he is quite small, he participates in karate and goes to public school where
             he is in 3rd grade.



             I believe you and your family are truly blessed. If there is anything that you would like
             to talk with me about, please feel free to contact me any time.



             Sincerely,

             Judy
