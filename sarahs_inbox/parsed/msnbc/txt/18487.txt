         Can we help the Army with this one? Short notice. Requires you authorizing US flag to be
        flown at half staff on military reservations in AK. Janice turned them down... not sure if
        you did it to send a message or whether she just did it but thought you should know this
        was going on.

           Dilemma below; please let me know what you recommend. I'm thinking I should reply to
          Robert's email supporting Janice's answer, regardless of whether there's a way to help or
          not....

           Janice,




          Need some help with this issue , when a Soldier from the United States

          Army Alaska gets killed in the line of duty we would like the Governor

          to authorize the US flag be flown at half staff on military

          installations .     We are in a time crunch for the Memorial Service to be

          held at Fort Wainwright Wednesday the 5th of September .          How can we make

          this happen for tomorrow and in the future? I will also call to

          discuss.




          Thanks
