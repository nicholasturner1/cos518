            This could put to rest those complaints that we are hypocritical be some are claiming we
            recently asked for 141 earmarks - more than other admins have asked for... and we knew
            that was not true.



            Does the senator think he's punishing us for this by posting our requests? I look at this
            as a good thing and was just thanked this weekend by the Transportation secretary and Sen.
            McCain for showing leadership on this. Pres Bush also acknowledged Alaska and asked us
            Gov's today to do what we can to help with needed reform in committees where earmark abuse
            previously was the norm. He was all about transparency and public discussion on earmark
            projects- he sounded just like us.

            Senator Stevens has just posted the State's 31 earmark requests on his website. I think
            he believes that this will point out the discrepancy between your statements and our
            actions.



            As I said to him this morning, I don't see any problem with the posting. We believe that
            all of our earmarks pass muster in terms of the criteria the Congressional delegation and
            the Bush administration have espoused.
