         April 28, 2007



         State of Alaska

         The Office of the Governor

         Juneau Office

         P.O. Box 110001

         Juneau, AK 99811-0001



         Dear Governor Palin,



         I am writing in regards to the current contract negotiations between the

         state and your GGU employees. I understand the necessity to be responsible

         to the citizens of Alaska and attempt to keep the costs of running

         government as low as possible. Even so, the state budget should not be

         balanced on the back's of your GGU workforce. For too long state employees

         have been moving backwards financially due to high rises in cost of living

         and consistently little or no cost of living increases.



         The wages offered for positions with the State of Alaska are generally not

         competitive with private and federal employers. By not offering livable

        wages that help us keep up with our living expenses the state will suffer.

         You will loose current employees to better paying jobs and you will never

         recruit the quality employees you want working for the state. The only

         incentive current employees have to stick with the state is possibly the

         retirement if they are tier I, II or III. As you know much of the states

        workforce is ready for retirement. What will you do to fill those positions

        when the pay is low and the pensions are gone?




                                                                  i




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0001347

          I am a seven year employee with the State of Alaska ' s Division of Public

          Assistance .     I have held the same position for those seven years and

          although my salary has increased, due to merit increases ,            I have steadily

          gone backwards in my ability to pay my bills due to very small cost of

          living increases .      The cost of living offered by previous administrations

          did not come close to keeping up with the actual rise in cost of living and

          inflation .    My merit increases are now very slow as I'm in longevity and

          will not get raises every year, which means I will fall even further behind.



          My office has several open positions that we cannot find qualified

          applicants to fill.        I too am now looking at the possibility of moving to

          federal employment as the pay is substantially higher to perform the same

          job duties.      If current negotiations do not yield a substantial increase in

          wages ,   looking for new employment will become a necessary reality in order

          to support my family.        My back is against the wall Governor Palin , please

          choose to do right by your employees .       Avoid a strike ,     stop attrition and

          adequately pay your employees for the work they do.



          Sincerely,



          Brian D .   Petrilla
