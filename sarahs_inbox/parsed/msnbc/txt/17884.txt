        I've attached a note from our friend at Fred Meyer. This is in response to my phone call
        that you needed to be in Anch/Petersburg and couldn't attend his event. Did he ask
        permission from you to put you in his ad?

        In our grand opening add for next week we did advertise that Sarah would be

        at the store to join in on the cake cutting event. If plans do change we

        would really like to have her here.



        Thank you,
