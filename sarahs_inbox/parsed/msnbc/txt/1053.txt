Janice: Possibly- do u think king air will be available for travel back to Juneau for Gov's Prayer
Breakfast in a couple of weeks? That may be most efficient way to travel for that event because I'm
determined to allow the whole First Family to attend at least one event together this year, this one
may be it. Thanks
