                After all of the sound and fury, it looks like Mr. Liddy might not be coming. Please
                see the email below from Adrian Herrera indicating that Radio American has pulled
                out of the trip.

                Liddy might still come on his own, but this seems unlikely. I have asked Adrian to
                keep us apprised of further developments.

                 Hi John,

                  I got a email from the COO of Radio America Mike Paradiso late Friday that they
                  are pulling out of the tour to Alaska. He gave no reason for the decision. I talked
                  with the producer of the show Franklin Raff whom I had been dealing with since
                  the beginning and he told me essentially at first that he was being pulled from
                  producing the show in what amounted to an internal feud between himself and
                  Paradiso. The articles in the ADN served as a the touchstone for all
                  this. Tuesday, Paradiso, whom I have not met, phoned me very angry about the
                  possible negative effects of the articles, but I managed to explain things to him
                  and calm him down a bit. Mike Navarre, as well as other members of the
                  Executive Committee of Arctic Power conference called to Paradiso throughout
                  the week and managed to get him back on board and everything seemed good to
                  go until Friday. I believe the RadioAmerica people had a meeting on the issue
                  late Thursday and, according to Franklin, personal grievances
                  and simmering animosity between the two (Franklin being very much for the
                  show to go on, Paradiso against it) led to Paradiso pulling Franklin
                  as "punishment" as Franklin put it. After my phone calls and emails to Paradiso
                  went unanswered to find out what was up Friday afternoon , I finally got notice
                  at 5pm Friday.

                  Liddy,who is independent of the radio station can do what he wants but will not
                  do anything without Franklin who is his right hand man. Franklin is in service
                  to RadioAmerica and is not being allowed to deal with the matter. Franklin, was

                  not talking to Paradiso last time I checked and stated to me he would resign his
                  position for a week in order to produce the show with Liddy he felt so strongly
                  about it. At any rate ...things are not looking good.

                  I will keep you informed as things progress today....

                  I don' t know that if Franklin was allowed to take time off (as he suggested) to do
                  the show, if it would be allowed to go through ... .he was adamant that he was
                  going to try and make this happen but, I have my doubts at this point whether
                  he can.
