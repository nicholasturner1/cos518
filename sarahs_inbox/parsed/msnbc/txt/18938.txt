          Governor,



          Received now. I was not aware of any need or discussion to hold it in Fairbanks.



          I read the Ear story today suggesting that the announcement was originally scheduled to
          take place in Fairbanks tomorrow . That is news to me . it had been scheduled by Revenue
          for last week.



          Kris

           Pat and Mike- in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd, I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks , and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event " out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate , and was I not supposed to announce ? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea , I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past , except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn ' t be able to participate , hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.



           If this was " hijackiing " it or it was out of line , surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
