           Dear governor palin. I don't think there is anything for you to do on these at this time.
           I will keep you posted. By the way I am in anchorage and I will be home for caster.
           Talis.

           I did not know of either one, so thank you. Do you think there's anything I should do with
           either issue at this point? If so- happy to do it.

              There are two important personnel issues that I think you are aware of (as your office
          has been involved ) however , in the outside chance that you have not been directly told
          this is a note to you:

          If you are already well aware I apologize for the redundancy .           If you need more
          information , let me know. Talis
