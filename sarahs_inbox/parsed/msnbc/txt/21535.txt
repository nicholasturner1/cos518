                 Legislators Need to Hear from THEIR Constituents!
                 The Legislative Special Session on Oil Taxes Continues.With only 19 days left, legislators are
                 saying they have not heard from very many constituents. We encourage you to help uschange
                 that.There are two opportunities for public testimony this week:

                 The House Resources Committee will be taking public testimony Tuesday, Oct. 30 at 6:30 PM

                 The Senate Judiciary Committee will be taking public testimony Thursday, Nov. 1 at 6:00 PM

                 You can testify by going to your local Legislative Information Offices (LIO) and signing up to
                 offer testimony on the House and Senate bills HB2001 and SB2001.

                 You can find the location of all LIO's in the State, online at the State Legislature's web site

                The Alaska State Chamber of Commerce is urging the Governor and Legislature to proceed with
                caution as they begin their review and deliberations on the Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT) and the

                 bill introduced by the Governor , Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share . The concern is that while the
                 Legislature works to restore public faith , outcomes based more on emotion than economics will further
                 chill the oil investment climate . A second concern is the stated goal of generating more revenue for the
                 treasury. The chamber does not agree with that goal , and we fear that Alaskans will confuse the outcome
                 of higher tax revenue with the goal of fair share.

                 We believe the tax debate creates unwelcome risk and stalls investment planning and decisions. Taxes
                 are a key consideration in all business investment decisions , so any time tax law is debated, investments
                 can be delayed. The wrong tax rate can end all consideration of investment. Certainly working to induce
                 investment such that the pipe is full of oil at $80+/bbl would generate more revenue at the current tax
                 rate than would a dwindling quantity of oil at a higher tax rate.

                 Given today's oil prices , the Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share (ACES) legislation proposes to collect
                 surplus revenue for a fiscal system that results in increased spending but lacks a strategic business plan
                 for the state. This policy outcome does not warrant worsening the investment environment.

                 The Alaska State Chamber strongly urges you to get out and offer your opinion on the proposed changes
                 to the Petroleum Profits Tax . This is your chance to be heard on this important debate on the future of
                 Alaska' s economy.
