        We met this morning with Conoco and Marathon, at their request, to

        discuss their application to the Department of Energy for an extension

        of the current export license for Cook Inlet natural gas.



        They expressed concern about the three conditions postulated by the

        State in its motion to intervene. The companies cited conceptual and

        practical reasons for their concern but agreed that the issues raised by

        the State need to be addressed in some form.



        Picking up on my previous discussions with the Department of Law, I

        suggested that Conoco and Marathon request a meeting with the

        Departments of Law and DNR to seek a resolution of the three conditions.

         I said that the conditions represented important goals but that there

        may be various ways to achieve them. I believe that the companies will

        pursue this avenue.



        In addition, the senior leadership of the companies wants to meet with

        the Governor.      I suggested that such a meeting might be most productive

        after the session with DNR and Law. At that point, we will have a

        better idea of what resolutions may be possible and what issues remain.




        As you probably know, the companies requested an extension of the

                                                          2

        initial deadline for public comment and intervention .             The new deadline

        is May 8th .     My guess is that we will see opposition to some of the

        motions for intervention.



        After the deadline , DOE is expected to issue rulings on the motions for

        intervention and also to issue a procedural order establishing the

        framework for the remainder of the proceeding. Per my earlier

        discussion with Daniel ,       I will stay in touch with DOE on the procedural

        issues for the time being.



        Please let me know if you need anything further from us.
