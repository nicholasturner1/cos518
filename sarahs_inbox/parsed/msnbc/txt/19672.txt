            News was good tonight. They talked about the new direction of the dept, annette having no
            idead what monegan was talking about, frank's disappointment in walt and that he was aware
            of the threats of wooten, and molly's statement that she had to call 911 last wk and
            wooten's threat the family was going down. By the way, the press release was great. It
            infers everything that wasn't being done under the previous commissioner.

                 Subject: Royalty oil

                 I would bet that at least one of a handful of people in Fairbanks will ask about using our royalty oil to fix the
                 energy/home heating oil crisis. Richard Tilly, Lisa Peger, and Jim Weidner have all been advocates of this approach
                 at one point or another.

                Richard Tilly is a local contractor who took the time to put together a fairly detailed proposal and set of figures. It
                was, in turn, sent to Commissioner Irwin by Rep. Kawasaki for review. We are very close to having an equally
                detailed response explaining why that approach can't and won't work.

                The bottom line is that a judicial decision suggests strongly that we can't sell royalty oil for less than we would
                receive than if we took it in value.

                Beyond that, much of our royalty oil is already under contract to Flint Hills, but even if we were to take it all in kind
                and sell it for less, it is unlikely to have the intended effect . There is more oil refined in Alaska than we have in
                royalty. We would have to subsidize non-royalty oil in order to get all heating oil, diesel, and gasoline produced in
                Alaska down to the same price.

                This will all be explained to Rep Kawasaki, Mr Tilly, and anybody else who asks about it in short order. We can
                take names and addresses for those who are interested and send them the details and report.

                Joe
