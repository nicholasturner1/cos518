          Governor -Bill Clarke from Chugiak (Craig Williams's father) called.and wanted to speak
          with you directly and "Thank you" for what you have done for Ciiaig. He explained that
          this would only take 60 minutes and that he owed this to his son. I explained that due to
          your schedule I could not promise a return call but that I would make sure you knew of his
          call and his thanks. Thanks, Janice
