              "In the summer of 2006 , 1 owned a king crab pot that was involved in a
              misdemeanor violation (set hours too early). Another individual was
              authorized to set or retrieve my pot under his own permit. I was not

              ticket which I paid."

             Sharon: Is this the Larry Edfelt who was cited last year for a fishing violation, ABWE Troopers ini
             Juneau, fishing for crab during a closed season? I haven't checked the court computer file yet
             so don't know how It came out. Looks like he put his pot in 2-3 hours before season opened,
             personal use, fined $200, crab seized. Age 63 so looks like the same guy.

             No big deal but maybe earish.
             Regards, Sheila

                                                     Governor Palin Fills Vacancy on Board of Fisheries


                   March 8 , 2007, Juneau , AK - Governor Palin today announced the appointment of Juneau resident , Larry Edfelt, to the
                   Alaska Board of Fisheries . Edfelt previously served on the board from 1992-1997.

                   "I am honored that someone of Larry ' s stature and experience has agreed to come back and serve the state again on
                   this important board ," said Governor Palin. "He 's familiar with Alaska fisheries from a number of vantage points. His
                   vision and temperament are just what this board needs."

                   Edfelt retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in 1986 , after a distinguished 23-year career . He served
                   as a fisheries biologist , Deputy Director of Commercial Fisheries , and Assistant Executive Director of the Boards of
                   Fisheries and Game before his retirement . He has also worked as a charter boat owner and operator. Edfelt is well
                   known around Alaska for his humorous columns published in the Juneau Empire and the Anchorage Daily News.

                   The seven members of the Alaska Board of Fisheries are appointed by the Governor , subject to legislative confirmation,
                   to conserve and develop the fishery resources of the state . This Involves setting seasons , bag limits, methods and
                   means for the state 's subsistence , commercial , sport, guided sport, and personal use fisheries , and it also involves
                   setting policy and direction for the management of the state's fishery resources . The board is charged with making
                   allocative decisions , while the Department of Fish and Game is responsible for management based on those decisions.

                   Edfelt will participate as a voting member at the Board 's next meeting , from March 9th to March 13th in Anchorage,
                   during which the board will take up statewide finfish and supplemental issues . If confirmed by the Legislature , Edfelt
                   will fill the seat vacated by Rupe Andrews of Juneau , who resigned last month.
