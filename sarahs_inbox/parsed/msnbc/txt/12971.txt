              Todd and Willow will be visiting classroom(s) on Wednesday, maybe one

              day before that too. We'll look for bookmarks for them to hand out in

              the Anchorage office, and we'll need a load of those kid books from the

              mansion to be transported here so we have them to distribute outside of

              Juneau (that can wait until we can load them in the king air). Pls note

              on sched what they'll be doing for First Family event(s) this week.

              Thanks
