               Finally, yet another study has shown that intake of omega-3 is vital for the development of vision and
               cognitive development in the final three months before a baby is born. A Quebec research study showed
               that babies born with higher levels of DHA, a component of Omega-3, in their umbilical cord blood had
               higher levels of visual and cognitive development in the first nine months of life. This is another reason
               why it is important for pregnant women to eat more seafood.
