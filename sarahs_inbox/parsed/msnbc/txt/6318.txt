          Agree with the gist of this - and I had assumed we'd sent a letter in response to Speaker
          Harris and the D's who called me on this a long time ago. Sounds like that letter never
          went, hence the opportunity for legislators to speculate that we've waffled on sp session.



          We owe it to them to respond to their earlier letters, especially now that they're running
          with rumors that have to be put to bed.



         We just talked to Mike about it.

         Pat - do not let "others " keep demanding what I want to do anyway - and that's call the
         special session for ppt revisit . Tell Sharon, Meg, et al , that despite what John Bitney
         may have told Dave Donaldson and others about us NOT wanting special session ( which has
         also led to all the speculation that I'm waffling on the issue ), I have NOT waffled - I
         still believe ppt is NOT solid , and that word needs to get out there asap or it appears
         we're just reacting to Gara ' s newest press reelease , or the ADN ' s editorial , or Doogan's
         op-ed.



         I will ask Sharon to do a press release on this asap, to clear up all the confusion in the
         public, unless you guys can get the message out a better way, and sooner.

         Alaska Day is October 18, 2007 . Sounds like a grand day to fix a problem that must be
         addressed sooner rather than later.



         The ideas expressed in your email reflect the promises I have made since even before
         kicking off my campaign on October 18, 2005.



         Look forward to hearing more . So far ,      sounds great . Thank you sincerely.
