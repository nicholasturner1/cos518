         We're going to have a communications mtg Thursday afternoon when Persily gets here, to
         talk about Alaska media and to lead comm staff to know WHEN i have to respond to media,
         and when they can do the responding for me. The last couple of weeks has been out of
         control media requests and most all of them landed in my lap. We need to strategize on
         communications, so I must make time on thurs to do this. Then once things are laid out
         I'll hopefully be able to trust our comm folks to take it from there... otherwise I'll
         continue to be bombarded with media and we'll continue to jump everytime they ask for an
         interview.



         I'll ask Janice to sched and invite sharon and beth - even if beth is via telephone. If
         you want to participate, pls do - we all need to be on the same page with comm - and
         things have to change for the positive in that arena. Thanks
