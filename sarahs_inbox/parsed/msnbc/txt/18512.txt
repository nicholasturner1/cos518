         Hey Willow Palin!!

         Email Heather and tell her to come AND to tell Eddie to let Alex & Eric go to Wasilla
         Friday night. :) Heather might come, she's suppose to film the Colony game for Eddie,
         but I'm trying to see if someone else can do the filming. What time is Bristol' s game?
         That would be a lot of fun to watch!!

         What's the weather like?

         Erika

         By the way what are you doing with your mom's BlackBerry!!?? :)

        Oh okay good.

        This is Willow. That stinks that eric and alex have to stay in anchorage, me and bristol
        wanted to hang out with them. Bristol also has a powder puff game that would be fun to
        watch. Is Heather coming up too? If so, we could have her over also.

        See you tomorrow!

        Hello,

        We worked out the details,        so we can make it for dinner tomorrow night.

        I spoke to Todd earlier ( TA stuff ) and he said that 6 : 00pm. would be good and he'd email
        the directions . Alex and Eric will be in Anchorage , but they have to stay and watch the
        Colony game- you know , scope out the other team...

        Thanks for inviting us over , we look forward to seeing you and your family!

        Erika
