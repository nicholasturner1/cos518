            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I just read an article about your son, Trig, and I felt compelled to email you, which I
            don't normally do.



            My husband, Randy, and I have a beautiful and wonderful, son, Hunter, who is 8 years old.
            I was 37 and Randy was 46 when Hunter was born. I did not have amneiocentesis until I was
            32 weeks pregnant.



            At any rate ..... Randy and I are both bankers ..... have been for a long time.... and I have a
            very demanding and rewarding career. He is our only child, and I think you are so
            fortunate to have 4 other siblings for Trig to learn from.



            At any rate, we are so blessed as Hunter is very vocal ..... has great communication skills,
            a wicked sense of humor, and touches all hearts he meets. He wooed Kyle and Patty Petty,
            Herschel Walker, and tons of folks in our town of Asheville, NC.



            This will be the most rewarding and challenging endeavor you take on in your lives. Randy
            and I cannot imagine our lives without Hunter.


                                                                  i
