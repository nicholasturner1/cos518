             Janice- has mayor Williams (ketchikan) even asked for a mtg during this week's visit? Has
             Tim Beck?



             Sharon/Beth- if u get the sense this gripe is growing legs (as my gut is telling me), pls
             respond with a stronger, proactive statement re: we DO rearrange scheds to make sure every
             mayor requesting does get a mtg. Thanks

             It's a scorcher. Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I won't/didn't spend time
             w/ the Mayors... sheeeesh...



             Sharon's comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our office. That's our
             committment.



             I don't want this issue to grow legs , so whatever we have to do to make sure we're not
             double-booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that they're being ignored - we'll do
             it,



             Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I have not done
             that and it'd be refreshing if reporters asked for facts to back up complaints like
             that... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug local officials into the schedule as best we
                                                                       1
