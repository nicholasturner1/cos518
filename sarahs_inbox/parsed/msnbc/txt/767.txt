  Governor,

  Thanks for the answer. I appreciate the administrations inability to share information with the public.

  I am interested in hearing about legislative priorities you may have. I wish you well. I will do my best for
  you all according to my principles.

  God Bless you all. Good Luck with everything, and I hope you will call on me if there is something I can
  help you with in the future.

  Glen

  Does he not understand that CP's "proposal" doesn't meet the state's "must haves"... they admit it's far outside the
  law (AGIA) and even CP has admitted locking up tax rates for 30 yrs (!) as Glen suggests is unacceptable to the
  legislature, the Alaskan public, this administration, and the Constitution. THEY don't even ask for a 30 year lock-up.
  He said that "the campaign" didn't have a problem with that fiscal certainty? Huh? And that he was the gasline
  consultant to the campaign? Huh? Tell that to the Magnificant 7 who publicly explained the folly of Murkowski's
  plan, and my willingness to embrace their advice and consultation.

  Surely he knows we would not divulge any AGIA info to him that we wouldn't share with the public at the
  appropriate time... despite the megaphone he has with his radio show and his frequent visits with Dan Fagan on
  Fagan's show.

  Governor,

  During the campaign, I counseled on the failures of the Murkowski Admins negotiations. These objections (and
  many other items) were highlighted in AGIA. I have a series of questions on the path forward regarding AGIA.
  While I need some answers to these questions, I am hoping that I can get your view on at least one critical question
  about locking in tax rates for Gas only. If Conoco accepts the other points in AGIA, would you sign a Republican
  Tax bill that locks in rates for everyone who pledges to participate in the open season (in 2008 even). Just off the
  top of the head, I am thinking about 30 years, use your original ACES numbers for tax rates on Gas.

  This is very important to me since the campaign was not opposed to a reasonable lockin of tax rates as long as the
  must haves were met. Conoco's proposal appears to meet them while guaranteeing a pipeline. Does that
  Administration. agree that lockin of tax rates is acceptable under these conditions?

  I am not looking to undermine AGIA. I am interested in making sure that I understand the goals of the administration on this
  critical point.

  To the reader of this email. I have had a personal relationship with the Governor in the past. I was a primary contributor to
  the plan for the Gasline during the campaign. In addition to that, I need to make sure that legislative and media options
  match the intentions of the administration. Hopefully it will be OK for me to call the Governor personally if I can't get an
  answer via email.

  At your convenience.

  Thanks
  Glen Biegel
