            Governor Announces New Direction for Department of Public Safety




            July 19, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin and Public Safety Commissioner
            Chuck Kopp today outlined a new direction for the Department of Public Safety. The
            Governor has directed Commissioner Kopp to focus on working cooperatively with state
            agencies, the military and other entities to expand the pool of applicants to fill vacant
            trooper positions and formulate an action plan to deal with rural crime issues.




                                                                             1

            "I am committed to bringing a balanced managerial and leadership perspective to the
            Department of Public Safety," said Kopp . " I will help form and then carry out the policy
            set forth by the Office of the Governor and meet the mission and needs of the department."




            Highlights of the plan include:




                      Efficiently using trooper resources and filling vacancies .  One example is to
            reclassify existing open trooper job positions to job classes ( Court Services and
            investigative support positions ) that are more easily filled, allowing troopers to
            carrying out a full range of public safety services.




            *     Comprehensively review the issues of alcohol and drug abuse and crime , particularly
            in rural Alaska . Additionally, consider adding manpower for alcohol and drug interdiction
            efforts.




                  Cooperatively work with state and federal agencies and other entities as part of a
            multi-agency effort that focuses on outreach , education , treatment and prevention , and law
            enforcement as part of an answer to alcohol and drug abuse prevention problems in rural
            Alaska.




            *     Establish strong lateral communications between departments to accomplish the
            mission of each department and to assist those agencies in meeting their missions.




            *     Establish a recruiting effort focusing on returning National Guard troops and other
            military service members , VPSO ' s and Alaska Natives.

             *       Increase training for troopers and VPSO's.




             *     Propose legislation that will slow the flow of alcohol to rural Alaska, particularly
             communities that have voted to restrict alcohol. One example would be reducing the amount
             of alcohol that can be shipped by written orders into rural Alaska.




             "I have high expectations and confidence in Commissioner Kopp's ability to lead the
             department in this new direction ," Governor Palin said . " His willingness to think outside
             the box and find new ways to work cooperatively with state agencies will improve the
             public safety of all Alaskans."
