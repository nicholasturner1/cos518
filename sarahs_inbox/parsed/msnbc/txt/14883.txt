           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:



           It was so encouraging to read in yesterday's paper about your son Trig - and your
           steadfast decision to "keep" him. My guess is you and I are possibly on different ends of
           the political spectrum; but life (in this case, Trig's) transcends such differences by an
           infinite gulf - and it is indeed of infinite value, Down's or not. By saying this I
           realize I'm preaching to the choir. But thank you for your decision. Ages hence Trig - in
           whatever way he can - will express his gratefulness to his mom and dad. And you will
           richly deserve his thanks.



           Blessings upon you and your family, and especially upon Trig -



           Bill Gillespie
