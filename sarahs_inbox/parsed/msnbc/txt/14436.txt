            Congratulations on the birth of your precious son! You are an inspiration to the entire
            country.I host a life-affirming cable TV talk show called Woman 2 Woman in the Portland
            metro area and wish to extend an open invitation for you to be on our show if your travels
            ever take you to Oregon. It would be an extreme honor for the people of Oregon to "meet
            you." (Today, I interviewed Dr. Alveda King! )



            Blessings to you, your family and the lucky people of Alaska!
