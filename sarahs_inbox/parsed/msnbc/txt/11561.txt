              I'd love to- but don't know if we can get out of Juneau at that time...

             Sarah:  Greg is our oldest son and we are quite proud of him. Could you check your
             calendar and get back to him about this? Sounds like it would be fun! My best, WAR

             Dear Governor Palin-



             I was wondering if you would be willing to be our Mears National Junior Honor Society
            Speaker.   We are planning the ceremony for April 22, 2008 at 6:30 at Mears Middle School,
            Anchorage, Alaska.    We would love to have you come and provide some inspirational words
            to our group.




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0010866

               Let   me know what your thoughts are on this matter.



               Sincere thanks,



             Greg Ross

              Do you have an email address for Sarah Palin? Do you suppose she would speak at my
             National Junior Honor Society Induction Ceremony?
