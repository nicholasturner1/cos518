  Subject : DC Flights
  Currently you are scheduled to depart for DC Friday morning and return late Sunday evening. If you are
  still planning to go, I looked at some other flight possibilities to shorten the duration of both the travel time
  and the stay. The event begins at 6pm on Saturday. I could not find any evening flights returning to
  Alaska after the event.

  Depart Anchorage Friday night/ Saturday morning on red eye: 12:55 a.m. / arrive D.C. at 2:49 p.m. Delta
  Airlines (partner thru Alaska Airlines).
  Depart DC Sunday morning: 8 a.m. I arrive ANC at 2:26 p.m.
