            Hello Governor and Todd,

            I discussed the schedule for the House with Kari yesterday; I apologize for the delay in responding to your email.
            I've attached a proposed schedule for the Window Project and will be meeting with the window contractor and the
            State Contracting Manager this week to finalize the schedule.

            We hope to do the most intrusive work at the House during July, when your office ( Cap. Bldg.) is being worked
            on. It's up to you whether you want to be at the House when they're doing certain rooms , so I'll keep you posted
            on what the final schedule is. If you needed to be in Juneau , when the kitchen is being worked on- you have your
            kitchenette and we could order take out. The goal is that they should be able to start and complete two rooms
            each week and will work around your schedule as needed.

            I will definitely let you know of any events the family is invited to . This House is much nicer with the family in it! 0

            Please let me know if you' d like to make any changes or have any input , otherwise I 'll assume that per my earlier
            discussion (with Todd) that this is acceptable.

            Thank you,
            Erika

           Let me know if the First Family is invited to any Juneau events this summer and we
           can get the kids back - otherwise I'll plan on them being in SouthCentral. We're
           headed to airport - Piper ' s with me , I'll bring Agia with me next time - she can
           hang out at the house and I asked Ivy to check on her at night.

           Also - I do need to know when the mansion work will take place so I can finalize
           summer schedules around that.

           Thanks !  Hopefully there will be a few First Family events for Piper and Willow, at
           least , to participate in in Juneau. With enough notice I can get them back here.
