             Dear Frank:



             Janet Huckabee is coming to Anchorage tonight. We are hoping to get Gov. Sarah Palin to
             meet her.  Can you contact her and ask her if this is a possibility? If it is, I am able
             to get Heartbeat Alaska to make an ad to show tomorrow. I would be able to get a few
             Natives together and it would go Nationwide.



             Sorry for the short notice, but God bless you speedily to make the arrangements.



             Thanks,



             B.   Akey C.




                                                             2




                                                                                                    PRA GSP01 0011270
