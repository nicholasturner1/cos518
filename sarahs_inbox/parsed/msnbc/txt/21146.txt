            Subject : STEP Program

            Dear Ms.Scavera
            Listed below are my concerns with the STEP program and pending legislation:
             1. Private employers have been exempted from the program through the elimination of tuition-
            based training.
            2. The responsibility for the program is given to the AWIB board in Alaska Statute and the
            program should be taken from the Division of Business Partnerships and returned to the AWIB
            board.
            3. Renewing grants at the discretion of the DOL without a public process is illegal.
            4. Considering grant applications as private property and unavailable for public review is
            illegal.
            5. Denying grants for formatting errors prior to evaluating the merit of the project is poor
            management.

           The program and pending legislation is discriminatory and will result in multiple legal
           actions. Please remind the Governor that at least 80% of Alaska's work force is non-union and
           that the Department of Labor represents all Alaskans, not just those that belong to a union. Last
           time I checked the name of the DOL has not been changed to the Department of Organized
           Labor.

           Thank you,
