           My opinion is yes, we should investigate the wrong doings, allegedly, of Murkowski and
           others who may have illegally benefitted from VECO in this past election cycle. No
           question about it. VECO has pled quilty.

          Talis-



          Matt Zencey called this morning asking about whether the governor should/would ask you to
          investigate issues that have come up at Kott's corruption trial. He specifically
          mentioned Dittman's polling for Frank Murkowski.  He wanted to know if that is going to
          happen and if so, would it be through a special prosecutor? I would appreciate any
          guidance you can give me on this.
