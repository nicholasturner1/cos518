             Subject: FERC/Alaska Gas Pipeline
             The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will issue another report to
             Congress in late July or early August on progress toward constructing an
             Alaska gas pipeline. The State was asked to provide a few paragraphs
             summarizing progress to date, together with a short description of AGIA.

             I thought that you would want to see the attached paragraphs which reflect
             the combined efforts of the natural gas team and this office. We will follow-up
             with FERC to ensure that they understand the State's current efforts to
             identify a licensee.
