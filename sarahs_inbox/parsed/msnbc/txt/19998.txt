                 Dear Gorvernor Palin,

                 I have written you a minimum of (3) times regarding the playground in Akiak , Ak but I have not heard back
                 from you.

                 Now I am writing you with a more pressing problem . Since 2002 the village of Akiak has experienced an
                 alarming rate of suicide amongst their youth (5( total). This is in a village of 300 . I believe my information is
                 correct. What a waste of Alaskan youth.

                 Please have someone offer assistance to the school and the village in bringing this issue to a halt. I am not an
                 expert in this matter but I do have some theories as to why it seems to be escalating.

                 I am available to discuss this matter with you via the phone if you want.

                 Thanks for your time.

                 Dan Reum
