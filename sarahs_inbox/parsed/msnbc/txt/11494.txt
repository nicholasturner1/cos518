             And I know team members want time to chew on this, but as has already happened this
             morning with KTW finding me at the NEA speech and wanting responses to CP's letter - we
             can't blow any tinmely opportunity to set the record straight , asap , and lay out facts
             when we are asked . Better yet , to be pro - active and anticipate what the public is wanting
             answered . Obvious to me is the public ' s questions : " why is she refusing to talk to CP"
             (not true , but that ' s what they ' re hearing ), and "is it true she just doesn ' t understand
             how to get this project built" ( shoot - don't defend me on this , but our team of experts
             had better be defended or Alaskans will continue to believe the big, pretty , expensive ads
             that CP pays for to tell Alaskans we're, essentially , naive , stubborn and idiotic).



             The response does need to be sent . It's fine, with minor corrections ... I don ' t want us to
             over - think the response and miss opportunity to speak to Alaskans . I WILL be asked,
             continually , until we release a statement.
