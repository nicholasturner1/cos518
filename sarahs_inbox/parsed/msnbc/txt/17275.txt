            you gave her the insurance adjusters position on a board, i thought.
            she's married to JD Daniels, who is VP of Northern Adjusters. I'm sure you talked to her, as JD
            stopped me at the ball to explain their reasons for not being allowed, legally, to let Susan accept
            the position

              Hmm. I don't know Susan Daniels. She's not in our database. Thanks for the heads up.

              Great! thanks

              Also, did you know Susan Daniels can't take the board position we gave her, due to
              conflict of interest? They researched it, found it couldn't work... did she notify you of
              that? Maybe you told me already and I forgot?

                Nice job, governor! You picked some great board members. I hope you made
                it back to town--the weather is ridiculous.

                Any day you want the tour/introduction/guest page gig for Track and Britta
                will be fine.

               I just wanted to let you know what GREAT additions Joanne Smith and
               Beth Farnstrom are to the Board of Nursing! They joined us for the
               first time at our meeting last week in Juneau. Both of these women
               contributed valuable input and insight, even at their first meeting!
               I am truly looking forward to their contributions in the future.
               Thanks so much for the great choices in appointments.
