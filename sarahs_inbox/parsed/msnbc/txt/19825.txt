            So that Molly doesn't have to contact adn editors to correct them and then be inundated
           with questions, pls jot them a correction: she is NOT going through a divorce or custody
           battle. It's been over, with the judge siding with her.

              Also, fyi... I shall be meeting with kopp to more fully understand the situation we
           discussed yesterday . I will not compromise on the commitment to open, honest communication
           - and am disturbed to read a reporter 's interpretation of his circumstances that seem to
           have been made clearer yesterday . I won't rely on press to get to the bottom of all this
           so I"11 be talking to kopp again.

              Mike-im going running-ill be in after that, sign bills, leave on the noon fit.. .good
           luck mtg w Hollis.
