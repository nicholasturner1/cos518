           Subject:                 Request


           Governor - I received a phone call from Nelson Garrett w/ Garrett's Tesoro in Anchorage.
           He's inviting the Governor to come out to Garrett's Tesoro Monday, 09.01 @ 2:00pm and help
           change the price of gas on their signs. The price is going down 8 cents and Channel 13
           will be there.




            I let Mr. Garrett know that you would be in travel status on that date .              He just wanted to
            relay that his truckers are so happy as every little bit helps .  Janice
