             Sharon - it's looking like leggies are actually on track to finish up in

             90 days , but if we have to hold them or call special session to consider

            AGIA then we have to strategize with gasline team on timing of such.



            We were the nice guys last year on location of special session and

             "suggested" special session take place in Anchorage , this time it's

            obvious they desire more direction so I'll be calling it in Anchorage.

            It's nonsensicle to ask Revenue, DNR, Oil and Gas, Law , press , public,

            etc to fly to Juneau to take care of AGIA this go 'round. It'll be taken

            care of on the more convenient road system.



            So, it asked, that ' s my answer - but I do understand we may want to

            strategize on announcing those intentions . Thanks!
