               Here is the message that went out to an email group of 22,940. The message went only to the business
               license holders email group. The list was originated through DCCED Business Licensing section. I did
               receive 1296 "undeliverable" responses.

               Dear Fellow Alaskan,

               With just a few days left in the 25th Alaska Legislature, the final actions taken by
               lawmakers will have a major impact on Alaska and Alaskans. HB 111, a critical bill
               which would lower the Business License Fee, is currently stalled.

               The Alaska economy is blessed by people with an entrepreneurial spirit. Business
               leaders provide new ideas and develop innovative products and services. By investing
               in their businesses, small firm owners make a major contribution to our economy.

               The original version of H131 11 that I proposed would have returned the business license
               fee, which was increased to $100 under the former administration, to $25. The fee
               increase has caused a hardship for those who are helping grow our economy,
               especially people who operate home-based and part-time businesses.

               The House Finance Committee amended the bill to set the fee at $50 and it sailed
               through the House because it makes good business sense . HB 111 is currently stalled                                         E
               in the Senate Finance Committee. I urge you to contact your senator TODAY and let
               him or her know that HB111 is good for Alaskans , who should not be penalized for
               stimulating economic growth.

               Until next time,
