        Governor:



        Sorry it took me so long to get this response back to you. I needed to talk with the
        contracting officers and review the Invitation to Bid in addition to the correspondence
        surrounding this contract.



        Royal Business Systems (RBS) bid on a statewide copier contract (issued September 15, 2006
        - Prebid conference was Oct. 6, 2006, and bids had to be submitted by Dec. 20, 2006).



        RBS has done work on some State copiers in the Valley prior to this bid, but as I
        understand it, they were seeking to increase their business through successful bidding on
        this contract.




        Here is a brief summary of our award of copier contracts in the Mat-Su Valley:




                       On January 16, 2007, we issued a Notice of Intent for the statewide copier
        contract. Royal Business Systems was named as having six copiers in the Mat-Su Valley that
        were susceptible for award. However, their bid did not include the required evidence that
        their local service technician had manufacturer authorization or certification to service
        their copiers.

                                                                  1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0001423

                       On January 26, 2007, Valley Business Machines protested Royal 's service
         technician qualifications . After multiple requests , Royal provided enough supplemental
         information that we initially determined their service technician met the ITB requirements
         and denied Valley 's protest.



                       On March 12 , 2007, Valley submitted an appeal which continued to challenge
         the qualifications of Royal's service technician.



                      On March 13 , 2007, we requested that Royal have their manufacturers each
        provide a letter or email that clearly certified that their service technician is trained
        and authorized to provide service and maintenance on machines in the Mat - Su valley. They
        were given until March 20, 2007 to provide the evidence.



                       On March 21 , 2007 , after not receiving any additional information from
        Royal , we determined them non-responsive for the Mat - Su Valley.



                      On March 27 , 2007 , Royal protested our non - responsive determination and
        argued that we should not have required more information but provided no additional
        evidence.



                      On March 29 , 2007 , we denied their protest . Royal did not appeal and we are
        proceeding to award . Valley Business Machines did provide the certifications of its
        technicians.




        This situation revealed to the State Procurement Officer that the State needs to be more
        vigilant in ensuring that technicians for these contracts are certified to work on the
        machines bid.   The State erred in its initial qualification of RBS , and had an opportunity
        to revisit that only because of the complaint by Valley Business Machines .    The State is
        bound to respond when someone protests a bid. As you can imagine , sometimes the complaint
        is valid and sometimes not. In this case, it ' s hard to understand why RBS did not timely
        respond with its service technician ' s credentials , when the contract was on the line.
        Because it did not, it will be out of game on this contract .    The contract has one-year
        extensions , and there will be another opportunity for RBS to correct the problems that it
        encountered on this contract .  We are also committed to make the next contract simpler to
        respond to.




        Governor , I want to be sure you ' re also aware of this background , although it doesn't bear
        on whether RBS' technicians are certified or not:

         A year ago, Mr. David Eibeck, owner of Royal Business Systems, Privileged or Personal Material Re
                                  Redacted
        Privileged or[After discussion with the Attorney Generals office he was advised on April 23,
         2007 that, "The state considers altering an email message a serious matter that cannot be
         overlooked. As a result, we are suspending your contract though August 31, 2006, and
         requiring you to assign another individual to administer the contract and represent RBS
         (Royal Business Systems) in all dealings with State of Alaska personnel regarding copier
         sales and maintenance agreements and the Division of General Services. This condition
        would also apply to the upcoming solicitation that will result in new statewide copier
         contracts".




        I hope this helps you evaluate the criticism that the State acted to "favor" someone else
        in this invitation to bid. It is my opinion in the face of all of the evidence I have
        seen , that that assertion is not true.
