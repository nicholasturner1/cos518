             It's a scorcher. Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I won't/didn't spend time
             w/ the Mayors... sheeeesh...



             Sharon's comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our office. That's our
             committment.



             I don't want this issue to grow legs, so whatever we have to do to make sure we're not
             double-booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that they're being ignored - we'll do
             it.



             Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I have not done
             that and it'd be refreshing if reporters asked for facts to back up complaints like
             that... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug local officials into the schedule as best we
             can - even if that means cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches. Thanks
