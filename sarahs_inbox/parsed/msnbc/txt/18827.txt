        So why would French be so insistent that he's sure there's disention internally with ACES?
        Is there? If so, please, please, please speak up and speak publicly about ideas to make
        it better, or any hesitency in going forward with these PPT fixes, etc. (See tonight's
        10pm KTUU coverage of this issue)



        I ask all of you to investigate the team involved in ACES to find out if there is that
        disention , because I ' ve been inquiring about that since first hearing the gross/net
        debates. Please send a strong message that there is no gag order , that the debate will be
        even healthier and more productive if any disenters will boldly step forth and voice their
        concerns.




       It's curious that some legislators have continued to claim this admin internal struggle -
       I'm either out of the loop or I must be missing something on this - be I'm unaware of the
       internal struggle they claim. If French and others are merely playing politics, please
       figure out a way to correct their false and unfair accusations so Alaskans can trust what
       we're proposing. Again, we need to get a step ahead of this issue or it'll grow legs and
       get away from us.




       Russ- pls contact Hollis in the morning to call him on it. And pls find out what the real
       beef is so we can provide him the info he desires.
