                          became rural. What would be the state funding for schools utilizing
                          current student enrollment statistics or pro forma enrollment for next
                          year?

                       2. Assume the Kenai Peninsula Borough was dissolved along with all
                          the municipal governments on the Kenai Peninsula. What would be
                          the state funding be for schools utilizing current student enrollment
