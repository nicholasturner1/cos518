           MESSAGE :

           Governor Palin, Todd, and family



           Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful baby boy!



           Vince and I know that he is truly a blessed little fellow, joining such a wonderful
           family. with three big sisters and brother to help you and Todd guide him along his way,
           he's sure to have a wonderful life.



           We just became grandparents for the first time on April 1st to Bailee Angelina Olson
           (Vince had to have pictures brought to him from Anchorage to share with friends, including
           Blanche and Josie!), and parents again on April 21st, with the adoption of Earl Tilden, a
           great young man we've had in foster care since he was 6 years old. He comes to us with
           challenges, but we also feel fortunate to be able to add him to our family.



           You're great roll models for busy parents and an absolutely awesome Governor!



           Thank you for all you do for your family and all Alaskans



           Patty Luckhurst and Family
