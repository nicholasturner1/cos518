             Wish they would have told me this before waiting so long for the final ad.



             So- let's get the word out.

             I spoke with Nizich about the Press Sec ad. He said that even running it will subject us
             to requirements; whether there is a close date or not. Therefore he suggested getting the
             position out there via word of mouth first. I agree; that way if you find the right
             person, you can act immediately.
