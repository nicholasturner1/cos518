MESSAGE:

Congratulations on your new baby boy! My family (5 kids also)

will be thinking of you and praying for your son's health and

happiness.

My friend, Judy Waldron, has a wonderful daughter, Lyn, age

19, who has Down's syndrome. Judy has been involved with the

Alaska chapter of the National Down's Syndrome Society for

many years. I have always admired Judy's strength and courage.

She has been an inspiration to me.

 I admire your strength and courage also. I know that your

strength will carry you and your baby through some of the

challenges that you and your family will face.
