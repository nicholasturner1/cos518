           MESSAGE:

           Hello,

           My name is Stacy, I wanted to write and tell you that I have worked w/ D.D. adults and
           kids since I was 12 years old.




           My favorite job so far was as a thereaputic horse back riding instructor.

            (I have worked at Easter seals, Girls scouts, and the YWCA)



           I have so much I want to say, but to some it up, when I think of a child with Down sydrome
           I smile, because I have never met a happier person in my life.

              Happy, hardworking, honest,

            Just three of the qualities you can count on your baby coming by naturally.

            We talk about down syndrome as an extra chromosome vs. the rest of us missing one

           I just had a baby, A boy who is 4 and half months old, he is my 3rd child the other 2 are
           teenagers and he was a surprise. I currently am a student at UAA, studing Psychology/law,
           with a goal of becoming a lobbist for D.D. rights.



           I guess my reasons for this letter are 3 fold,

           1. Your view as far as pro life, you were put to the test and you didn't wavier, Amazing
                                                                1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0017221

            2. Just to say congrats , all babies change your life and some

            Change the world!

            3. I would love the chance to help , for free . Like I said I am a student , I am off all
            summer and then have plenty of free time during school , my baby would love a playmate.



            I am 31, not a kid.    I have worked w / D.D. for 19 years, I have all the normal stuff
            ( C.P.R./First Aid/C.N.A. / Medication delagated in 3 states / Thereaputic riding instructor
            in 2 states)

            I love the work I do ,    It completes me.



            I am amazed by your ability , not only as a Gov, but as a Mother .            The fact that you Juggle
            both so well,....

            No one even knew you were pregnant for months , and all along you were planning to give
            birth / while running the state , Hats off to you.
