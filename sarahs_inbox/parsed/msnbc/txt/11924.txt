                  Dear Ms. Heuer,
                         I understand you are taking comments to address the move of the SW V position to Wasilla from Bethel.
                         Please take the following concern.
                       To Whom it may Concern,
                       It was a great disappointment to learn of the decision to move the SW V position from Bethel to Wasilla.
                  The Bethel OCS office already has a horrendous turn over rate and to take away a key position of the few
                 remaining workers is totally unrealistic.
                       With that position gone, the Tribes are going to have to work with the already overburdened staff to consult
                 with. The Tribes need that position as much as OCS does.
                       Our communications with the Bethel OCS is not the greatest and to go beyond the region poses even more
                 challenges. The location of that position will not be strategically sound especially with the ever growing cases
                 we have in the region. With that position we have been able to find ways to create a better working relationship
                 for all parties and to take it away will be a step backwards.
                       If this plea to reverse the decision falls on deaf ears at least PUT SOMEONE IN THAT POSITION WHO
                 KNOWS AND HAS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THE AREA. NOT ONLY
                 THAT, SOMEONE WHO WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE
                 BUILT OVER THE YEARS.
                 Quyana for your time.

                 Marcia Amik,
                 P.O. Box 219
                 Bethel , Alaska 99559
