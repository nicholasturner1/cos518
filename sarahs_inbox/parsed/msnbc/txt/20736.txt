              Bill,

              The Governor's speech was perfectly delivered. The best line was her own, the line about the difference
              between a hockey mom and a pit bull. The personal bio portion was the next most compelling. The
              boiler plate portion of the speech, the part the McCain hacks inserted, didn't do the ticket much good.

              My two cents? The governor has better political instincts than McCain. She can charm the socks off
              America if McCain and "his people" will simply let Sarah Patin be Sarah Patin. The governor didn't get
              herself an eighty percent approval rating by being anyone other than who she is. I hope she'll remember
              that.

              In my opinion, the governor simply needs to get up to national security, foreign affairs and economic
              and McCain policy positions speed. Once she does that, I'd tell her to let her own fine mind and good
              political instincts sort out what should be said and how best to say it.

             My two cents,
             Phil
