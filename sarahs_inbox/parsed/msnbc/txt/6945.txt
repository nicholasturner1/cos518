            pis work with Gary/Bob at Security, as I was told by a security person yesterday that bill alien
            did travel with Murkowski - don't know how many times, but they'll know.

              I just learned that Bill Allen has served , and still serves, on the Alaska-Alberta Bilateral Council.
              This council is under the purview of Boards & Commissions. In that capacity , Bill Allen (and also
              Rick Smith ) attended the working group meeting in Edmonton in May of 2004 . Murkowski
              attended as well as Greg Renkes and a number of other state officials . I have a list of attendees
              that I'll be faxing to Karl . The next working group meeting was in March of 2006 in Juneau. Both
              Bill Allen and Rick Smith attended. I will fax a copy of that agenda and participants as well.

              In November of 2004 , Bill Allen attended the Council of State Governments trip to Thailand with
              Murkowski , Mrs. Murkowski and Margy Johnson . Murkowski was president of CSG at the time.
              Veco sponsored the trip for $15 ,000. Documentation will be faxed . Following the CSG trip to
              Thailand, they all traveled to Taiwan.

              Linda Perez should have further details on expenditures , etc. or any domestic travel . Please let
              me know if you'd like me to follow-up with her.

              Kari - would you document for me the times Bill Allen accompanied Murkowski and/or
              Clark on trips, incl the international travel(s) - some of these also included Margy
              Johnson.

              It will be necessary for you to ask other commissioners/staff for info on this.

             Kris may be able to get some of that info with you. Thank you
