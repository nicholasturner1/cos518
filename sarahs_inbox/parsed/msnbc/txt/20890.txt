          We are having several folks look into this for us.

         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted         e s   derson wrote to me again this morning
          requesting you ca       a special session to a ress this problem. I think this can be
          addressed in the upcoming session. Randy is going to attempt to draft a response to
          Begich. This is a statewide problem. The migration is happening in every region of the
          state.

            I spoke with Mike N. several times in last week to let him know I'm going to be getting
           briefings or having meetings on some of the big picture items. For example, on the budget,
           I'm going to see where we are on the large spending drivers ( labor contracts , Medicaid,
           education , etc.). I just want to see what kind of increases the departments are planning
           in these areas for FY 10, and will let you know as I find out this stuff.



           Also, Begich and Comeau apparently sent a letter today to you regarding emigration from
           the Bush to Alaska ' s urban centers . It's on the ADN website . You should look at it if you
           haven't seen it. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             I wanted to send a note of thanks for your great job in a harsh environment . I also wanted you to know that not
             everyone is against the appointment of Mr . Chuck Kopp. Mr. Kopp has coached my son for three years in high

             yours and his direction , but I pray for your continued strength to push on for what is right. Beverly Hubbard says
             she knows you to be a Christian so you know that the Bible says the world will hate you.

              Dear Governor Palin,

              I am writing to you in support of my friend Chuck Kopp . I have known Chuck since junior high,
             and as we have "grown up" together I have seen him develop into a wonderful Christian man,
             full of integrity. The accusations and defamation of his character are outrageous . I am sure
             you well know that being in the political arena brings all kinds of attacks on a person and their
             family. It is sad to see. I just want you to know that I know Chuck will do a great job as Public
             Safety Commissioner. He has the confidence and ability to do the job well . I ask that you not
             let the media and the public who want to smear a man 's reputation win on this one . As a friend
             to Chuck and Trish , my family and I stand by them.

             Sincerely,
             Jennifer and Jacob Barkman

             Dear Editor:
             To address Judi Spry's Anchorage Daily News letter-to-the-editor on July 26 asking where the Governor
             was during this year's Miss Alaska Pageant:


                                                                                                              12/19/2008

              First, when I asked Gov . Palin if she was ever Miss Alaska (as Ms. Spry stated), our Governor replied,
              "hope, a mere "Miss Congeniality ", one of the runner -up sashes, and much-needed college scholarships
              were my wins as a participant in that scholarship progam, about 100 years ago it seems now".
               The letter suggested the Governor didn't take time to attend the four-hour pageant due to a lack of
              support. Although constantly apologizing for not being able to accept all invitations , in this situation it
              was especially important for Alaska to have Governor Palin keep her committment to travel to Fairbanks
              that evening between the weekend' s statewide Governor' s Annual Community Picnics and meet with
              seven US Congressmen who were touring ANWR.
                Due to time constraints , to support pageant participants Gov. Palm did take time to record a video
              which was shown during the pageant. And significantly , First Gentleman Todd Palin spend two days
              judging the event. Todd left commercial fishing early this season to keep his committment judge, and
              those who know the fishing industry (and those who know Todd !) can appreciate the sacrifice that was
              on the part of Todd Palin to support the pageant, on behalf of the Governor and First Family.

               Les Gara called me about Court of Appeals late Friday and asked if Walt could be brought back as
               well, that this would take the wind out of the sails of the investigation. I'm passing it on to you as I told
               him I would. I didn't give any sense on Walt, and asked him about AGIA. I can't see how on earth that
               could turn out well in the end.

               On AGIA he did say you could get the votes but that it would probably take individual visits to
               Senators.

               absolutely nothing to do with problems from 2005 with a former brother-in-law. I never asked, nor
               pressured Walt in any way to fire Trooper Wooten, as he admitted to reporters once he realized the
               suggestion had been made. When first elected, my security detail asked that I forward on concerns to
               Walt about the one and only threat I've known of against me and my family (that was Wooten's). It was
               appropriate that I did so. I have no regrets in forwarding the concerns to him, as any citizen would do.
               No personal feelings ever influenced my recognition that DPS needed a lot more action and results in
               dealing with some horrendous activities in rural AK, and needed action to fill the dozens of vacant
               trooper positions that have sat empty for more than two years now. Thanks, and hope ypu have a great
               Sunday.

              Hi,
              I have been thinking of you and praying for you. I don't know what REALLY happened with the DPS
              Comm job. I know you can never be sure about what you read in the paper. I do want to encourage you
              though. This is just my opinion (and a little bit of Biblical wisdom mixed in) based on hard lessons I
              have learned in life. IF you did fire WM in part or in whole because of the brother in law, just admit it
              and make it right. Hire him back if that makes sense and even if it doesn't, just say that you are sorry
              you let personal feelings get in the way and move on. People will forgive you, especially if you admit
              you made a mistake, quicker than if an investigation shows the same without your admission. I am not
              sending this to anyone else and I hope you are not offended but I want you to know that even if you
              did make a mistake, we all stand ready to get past it. You have high enough approval ratings that this
              will just be a little bump in the road if you admit to any mistake quicker than if you don't, assuming
              you did make a mistake. Again, I am just going on what I read in the papers.

              Respectfully,

              Debbie Joslin

              REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL ( RFP) FOR CONSTRUCTION
              · DOT&PF's review of KABATA's RFP to solicit for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of the
                 roads and bridges that comprise Knik Arm Crossing project found the following unacceptable provisions:
                     o State of Alaska would bear the risk if government permits were not secured within 17 month
                           o State of Alaska would guarantee payment to concessionaire when specified toll numbers are not
                               reached
                           o There is no provision to build the $250 million Ingra-Gamble Connector
                           o Contains incomplete communications plan for informing public, legislature, and administration about
                              the terms of the RFP
              ·     KABATA was instructed to not issue the RFP and to increase their communications efforts

             ·      KABATA's estimate of the cost of the project has not changed in 5 years
             ·      DOT&PF and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are contracting for an independent 3rd party estimate
                    due in October

                plan and prioritize all transportation in the community via a long range transportation plan
             · The Anchorage MPO (AMATS ) is comprised of the mayor, two Assembly members, and representatives
               from DOT&PF and DEC
              ·     The recent changes in the composition of the Anchorage Assembly may result in the withdrawal of support
                    for the project and its removal from their long range transportation plan
                           o FHWA would immediately stop their work on the Record of Decision
                           o Anticipate vote on the project in 4 - 6months_

               Friends,



               Sorry I'm late tonight! Although always unscientific, there's a very important KTUU poll
               tonight. The question asks will the investigation into the Monegan termination find wrongdoing
               on the part of Governor Palin? We are currently in the lead with 55% saying no.



               Here's the link to vote http ://www.ktuu.com/

              The trip was very good . Good attendance from all the surrounding villages as well as the North Slope . Regional
              leaders were there, so that was good. I spent a lot of time with Marie Green.

              The view is mostly Regional , not much of a Statewide perspective in the crowd. Most of the feelings towards the
              Palin administration is positive (from the current generation) the old "TK" guard is alive and well - Shively,
              Scanlan , Joule, etc. But, they are on their way out, not in. The young people want to move forward and they are
              very progressive.

              I encouraged the formation of Regional Energy Authorities as a subset of the Borough . The Regional Energy
              Authority could formalize a relationship to align itself with the coming Governor 's Statewide Energy Policy due this
              coming January . That idea grew legs.

              DCRA needs to provide some Planning training for the Borough and villages . They need that and my division has
              the experts to get it done and we will.

              When I left the airport, the local radio (14,000 plus listeners thru out the NW) the DJ was urging listeners to call
              their elected officials and ask them to pass the gas line legislation@ (Olsen and Higgins.)

              THANK GOD!!

              Now the work begins . I want you to know I hope you will use me as these implementation groups ' forms. I feel
              compelled to look out for Rural Alaskans ! Most folks who are supposed to make it fair really just give lip service.
              The genuine people I know of who can make a difference (!n State gov) are Emil and Rhonda. I also think Ivy has
              great potential and is a true heart
              Carpet baggers and opportunists will come crawling out of every nook and cranny . I know how they work Sarah.
               You scratch my back , and I will scratch yours" is their mantra (as you know). The money is mind boggling and a
              recipe for corruption.

              Use me , I'm here to serve.
              Congratulations to you on a spectacular victory. Your family deserves my gratitude too for all the support they
              give you so you can do all of this for Alaskans. I am so moved! I am so proud of you.

               Subject :   Catch 22

              I had an interesting discussion with Adam Berg , Rep Bryce's guy last Friday. I called him to ask why we
              (Commerce) got reamed by House Finance. In a nutshell, I learned that.

             There is frustration with the governor's office because they expect more legislation (or ideas) from the Governor
             because she is our elected leader. This nasty hearing was an expression of their frustration.

             My reply: I thought the elected reps were expected to offer solutions as they are the voice of their constituency. I
             sent his office ideas and hoped they would do something with them . According to him, ideas from a freshman are
             hard to sell.

             His reply: that Isn't what they are used to. They expect Department Commissioners to offer up ideas to the
             Governor to take forward. (My Commissioner was resolute in supporting the Governors ideas and not detracting
             from them with ideas of our own. I followed his instructions to the letter.)

             My reply: Should I have done more or done something differently?

             His reply : Everyone knows who is responsible for the Department and I shouldn 't take it like a personal failure,
             which I never did.

             My question is - who is on first? Do you need to ask us for ideas and solutions that we process through our
             Commissioner? For all I know, you probably do. How does this work ? What I do know is that DCRA Is sitting on
             a boatload of data and information especially on rural issues.

              Hello Gov. Palin.

              I will be arriving in Anchorage Saturday night [8/9] and plan to start work on Monday
              morning the 11th. I'm in the process of finalizing the details of renting private office space
              in downtown Anchorage and hope to have that completed soon.

              Since we've never met, I would like to come by your office for a couple of minutes to say
              hi. What I have in mind is just a quick meet and greet, not a big deal, and not to talk about
              the case either. I just want to introduce myself and meet some of your staff. By then I
              should have my office location details and contact info ready for you. I appreciate your
              willingness to cooperate with me, and this informal meeting can serve as a good ice breaker
              for both of us. Can we meet, say Tuesday 8/12 ? [pick a time].

              Also, since my work is expected to take a couple of months, I think it would be a good idea
              if you could designate someone close to you to be my contact person to handle requests for
              information, and basically act as mission control between us in the event you are
              unavailable.

              I've heard it's rainy and cool up there, so it will be a welcome relief from our dry and hot
              weather here in SC.

              Regards-

              I am looking forward to working with the Renewable Energy Fund advisory

              The AK Energy Plan is advancing well. I will be meeting with Tom Irwin

             Good morning Governor - the House Finance version now has the Resource
             Rebate at $1,200 and the Senate passed $500. They will take up both

             think some progress is being made, but it is slow going! Karen

             House needs to bump the rebate way above the Senate's version. And I
             need assurance Revenue can get the checks out attached to PFDs early...
             fuel barges take orders earlier than the October PFD disbursement. The
             public does not know that our intention is to get surplus $ into
             Alaskans' hands before October. Pls let leggies and the public know
             that.

                Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin to a renewable energy task force ; and reappointed
                Scott Heyworth and Dan Sullivan to the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority (ANGDA).

                "Alaska has huge supplies of both renewable and non - renewable energy, " said Governor Sarah
                Palin. "With the Legislature 's recent approval of the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, ANGDA
                must continue its work to make Alaska natural gas available to Alaskans.

                "But while continuing to utilize our fossil fuels, we must also work to develop wind, solar,
                hydroelectric, geothermal or other local sources of energy for Alaskans. I am pleased my
                administration and the Legislature are working closely together in this exciting effort to bring
                new, sustainable energy to Alaska."

                The task force, advisory council and a renewable energy grant fund were created by House Bill

                152, a wide-ranging bill aimed at identifying and developing renewable energy resources in
                Alaska, especially in areas of the state where Alaskans face excessively high energy costs. The
                bill was sponsored by House Speaker John Harris, co-sponsored by 38 other lawmakers, and
                signed into law by the governor on May 30.

                The bill creates a fund, to be administered by the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA), which will
                award grants to fund feasibility studies and other groundwork to support development of
                alternative and renewable energy. The bill calls on the Legislature to appropriate $250 million
                over five years, and the first $50 million was appropriated this year.

                The renewable energy task force is charged with meeting at least four times to assess the state's
                future renewable energy needs and issue a report making recommendations on how to meet
                those needs. The task force includes six legislators appointed by the presiding officers of the
                House and Senate, and one member appointed by the governor.

                operations in Interior Alaska and Nevada. Irwin has also served as vice president of government
                relations for Golden Valley Electrical Association.

                House of Representatives, are: Sens. Joe Thomas of Fairbanks, Charlie Huggins of Wasilla, and
                Bert Stedman of Sitka, and Reps. Bryce Edgemon of Dillingham, Anna Fairclough of Eagle River,
                and Bill Thomas of Haines.

                The renewable advisory committee is responsible for working with AEA Executive Director Steve
                Haagenson to establish criteria for evaluating applications for grants from the renewable energy
                fund. It will also evaluate grant applications from utilities, local governments and housing
                authorities for feasibility studies or for actual construction projects, and recommend which grants
                the Legislature should fund.

                The advisory committee includes representatives from small rural and large urban electric
                utilities , Alaska Native organizations involved in renewable energy , the Denali Commission, plus

               an overland main line carrying gas from the North Slope to Lower 48 markets , the authority has
               shifted its focus towards preparing the way for a spur line to bring gas from a main line at Delta

             Dear Governor Palin,

             I am responding to Gene's e-mails now that he is "one of the Good
             guys" taken down by IRS again.
             He was arrested on indictment last week and I am devastated although
             this was inevitable.

             Sorry no more prophetic word for anyone from Gene as the IRS via our
             "justice system" plans on keeping him forever.
             Charges will not be adequately defended as they are refusing him bail
             no real means to defending himself as he will be a prisoner with
             strained communication priviledges.
             He has much evidence to use to bring "truth to his actions" to this
             situation and has been told that he will not qualify for a public
             defender. I sense and perhaps I know they are planning not to allow
             him to even try to win any of his charges...and there are many. I
             was told earlier by lawyers who we sought info regarding what they
             were investigating us for....both answered they don't like Gene and
             they want blood from a tax protestor.... but more correctly Gene was a
             system protestor and he hit more more than once.

             Anyway I let you know because he has much respect for your love of
             God and the words He has for us..and he knows you are one who seeks
             the truth of corruption in our government. I knew you to be a
             friend and I am letting all our dear friends know he is no longer
             available in the way they knew him.

             Forgive me if you are compromised by this information. Please let me
             know if it is and I will be happy to delete your address from his
             computer.

             I only seek information now on how I would go about contacting the
             proper authority that handles what I found to be an "Apostille" a

               Subject:   Pupil Incentive Program

              Governor Palin,

             I apologize for not responding sooner. My itinerary for the last week had me on the road talking to
             teachers, school boards, principals, superintendents, etc. (Anchorage, Kenai, Kotzebue) Here are some
             thoughts on the incentive program.

             A hand raising survey of superintendents who attended the Fall meeting last week evidenced that the
             vast majority did not support the Pupil Incentive Program. A few were ambivalent and one
             superintendent indicated that he supported the program. (Woody Wilson: Superintendent from Wrangell
             and husband of Representative Peggy Wilson)

             Initially this program was proposed by EED.

             Fifty percent of the teachers who received an incentive check in 2007-2008 responded to a DOE survey.
             Of those responding, only 70% liked the program.

             It is a three-year pilot. As you know, EED just announced results for the second year.

             Year One: Funded at up to $5.8 million. Disbursed $1.89 million.

             Receiving payments were 949 school staff or school district staff members for 42 schools in 15 districts.

             Year Two: Funded at up to $3.9 million. Disbursed $1.06 million.

             As the PIP program is GF, almost $2,000,000 can be returned to the state.

             Receiving payments were 500 school staff members and an as-yet-unidentified number of school district
             staff members for 32 schools in 14 districts. Two large Anchorage schools just missed qualifying for an
             award. Had they won, the Year Two stats would have been closer to the Year One stats.

             Characteristics of awarded schools:
             In the first year, more awarded schools were rural or off the road system than urban or small town. In the
             second year, about two-thirds were urban or small town, and a third were rural or off the road system.

             Many of the awarded schools have had at least the statewide average percentage of students with
             disabilities and low-income students.

             Some of the awarded schools are very small schools in Native villages. They are not composed of
             academically advanced students from prosperous families. Rather, those schools won for showing
             significant improvement among students who are far behind. That achievement, of course, is a very
             desirable step toward proficiency.

             Some other awarded schools are from largely Caucasian communities or are charter schools with a large
             proportion of Caucasian students. For the school year 2007-2008, the awarded schools collectively had a


                                                                                                            12/19/2008

                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0024170

                                                                                                                Page 2 of 3


             notably smaller Native population ( 14%) than the statewide figure for all schools (24.5%).

             It is very hard for large schools , such as standalone middle schools and high schools in cities, to win
             awards. This is because significant improvement among just a few students in a small school will have a
             greater effect proportionately on the school ' s total results. That mathematical fact disadvantages
             Anchorage and other cities with large schools.

             By the way, it is not unusual for students who score advanced one year to score at a lower level in the
             following year. About a quarter of advanced students regress in a given year. So it is an achievement to
             keep advanced students at an advanced level.

             Original purpose of the program
             The incentive program is based on growth or sustained advanced performance in individual student's
             scores on the state standards-based assessments. Each student counts.

             The program is intended to encourage everyone on a school 's staff to collaborate and take shared
             responsibility for all students, use instructional time effectively , and use the results of standards-based
             assessments to target each student ' s academic needs.

             We aren't asking teachers, principals and support staff to work harder. We're asking them to work
             differently, using their talents and experience.

             We're asking schools to broaden the responsibility among the staff for promoting skills in English and
             math, which are the foundation for all academic studies, many occupations , and the ability to understand
             public issues and participate as a citizen.

             Unlike the federal No Child Left Behind Act, the incentive program does not require schools to meet
             targets in proficiency . Rather, it rewards schools for student growth.

             Even so, I believe that the vast majority of teachers in the State do not support the PIP program. They
             believe that a $$ award for achievement diminishes their professional responsibilities . Districts tend to
             downplay the award to avoid creating disharmony among schools or they use the award as an
             opportunity to share their negative thoughts about the program on TV and radio.

             There are other incentives that would have a greater impact on efforts to increase student learning and,
             enjoy increased support by Alaska's educational community . However, I am unconvinced that financial
             incentives actually lead to increased student learning.

            I hope this information helps . If you would like me to respond to the editorial in the Anchorage paper...
            I would be happy to develop a letter or compass response.

            I am looking forward to the opportunity to share and hear your thoughts on a variety of possible
            educational initiatives , dreams and ideas . It is great to be part of your administration. Please know that
            I will help and support in any endeavor that you request.

            Thank You,

            S-

            I am bothered by what I perceive as an unnecessary paranoid reaction by some people on staff to the recent
            attacks on you.

            First of all , if one is accused of communicating inappropriately and therefore changes their behavior, they are
            saying to the accuser "You are right. I was wrong . I will change how I communicate ." Abandoning email
            practice for example. This is a whole new world that election folks and legal folks haven 't even begun to analyze.
            It will change our world. In fact, I believe the effects of email were very apparent in your campaign.

            I, for one, refuse to let anyone take away my freedom of speech , my right to communicate to anyone , or my right
            to privacy. We need to stand tall , shoulders back, look critics dead in the eye, and say "I haven't done a thing I
            need to apologize for."

            I'm right there with you. Don't know if you will get this message, but I hope so.

             Sarah : It has been a while since I 've heard from you . You've come under some fire and I think you are being too
             nice. You were elected to drive the train . If it was me, I'd tell such attackers "I got elected to run the train and I'm
             running it the best that I can . I don't think it is appropriate for me to have to justify every decision I have to make
             just because somebody disagrees with me , and I don 't intend to do so."

             I also believe that you have to remember your friends , of whom Frank Bailey is one . He acted with the best of
             intentions and he shouldn 't be hung out to dry. If I commented at all, I would have said something like "Mr. Bailey
             made a call without my knowledge and I don 't agree with what he tried to do . Nevertheless, he thought he was
             doing the right thing and I appreciate State employees who seek to do the right thing . End of statement."

            I sure dislike seeing you take flak . But I disagree with your thinking you have to kowtow to your attackers. You
            need to get a spokesperson who has the authority to tell those people to "pound sand " (politely of course) when
            these things happen . You've got Alaskans behind you and you need to rely on that more and be less defensive.

            Just my thoughts for what they are worth.

             I'll buy you lunch when your schedule allows and we can talk further about this , if you'd like.

            My best, WAR

                LNG is the key to energy security
                by Rex W. Tillerson

                23-07-08 In recent years concerns about energy security and the environment , including the risks posed by
                rising greenhouse-gas emissions, have risen sharply.
                So have energy prices , of course . Today, high prices for crude and petroleum products are causing hardship
                for consumers around the world , and straining energy partnerships , as well.

                Such developments are not new to our industry 's history. Today's prices reflect, in part, the cyclical nature of
                the global commodities that we produce.
                But behind this current cycle is something new - and encouraging . The global economy is expanding at an
                historic pace . In fact, in less than a generation , the world economy has grown by more than 50 %. Millions
                have escaped poverty as a result, and billions more have achieved higher standards of living.

                All of us in the oil and gas industry have played an essential role in this historic growth . Energy is
                fundamental to nearly all economic activity and modern standards of living . So itis not surprising that as
                prosperity has spread , energy demand has grown . Today's high energy prices reflect that rising demand and
                a need for additional supplies - and, in a sense , they are a symptom of the world's success.
                The challenge we face today is continuing to provide the energy needed to sustain economic growth and lift
                more people out of poverty, while also minimizing the effects of energy usage on the environment . By 2030,
                global demand for energy will likely be about 30 % higher than it is today - even with substantial gains in
                efficiency.

                To meet this growing energy demand , we must develop all commercially -viable energy sources. No single
                source can meet the world's growing energy needs . In the world 's diverse energy mix, oil and natural gas are
                expected to account for nearly 60 % of total energy through 2030 . Their relative availability , affordability,
                efficiency and versatility make them indispensable.
                I would like to focus on two important sources of energy , both of which reflectthe energy challenge and the
                capabilities of today 's energy industry . One of these sources comes from the supply side, the other from the
                demand side.

                Beginning with the supply side, I want to illustrate how in a relatively short period for our industry , technology
                can significantly transform and enlarge new sources of supply to world markets . The development of the
                global market for liquefied natural gas or LNG is a clear demonstration of the power of innovation and
                partnership to meet growing energy needs.
                Thanks to technological breakthroughs in LNG production and transportation , consumers here in Europe and
                around the world are paining greater acces-sAo safe- liable and affordable su lies of natural gas. Todav,
                power-generation accounts for 35 % of the world's total energy usage and is expected to account for more
                than 40 % of the increase in global energy needs from 2005 to 2030.

                Not only will a global LNG market help meet these needs , it will also strengthen global energy security by
                helping to diversify supplies . And because it is cleaner-burning than other conventional sources, natural gas
                has important environmental advantages as well.
                Partnerships. such as the one between ExxonMobil and Qatar are making LNG's potential a reap.

                                                                                                                      PRA_GSP01_0024176

                                                                                                                     Page 2 of 3



                Technological advances. pioneered with Qatar Petroleum and others, have enabled ExxonMobil to achieve
                new economies of sc le for development of the North Field the largest non-associated natural-gas field in the
                world. In particular, our new Q-Max ships, which use ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum's technology, can
                carry 80 % more LNG than conventional-size ships.

                With new projects starting up over the next two years. ExxonMobil Joint Ventures in Qatar will bring more
                new LNG capacity to market than any other international oil com any. A key component of this growth will be
                the Adriatic LNG terminal , a project led by ExxonMobil , Qatar Terminal Limited and Edison . It is the first
                offshore gravity-based re-gasification terminal in the world, and has the capacity to provide 10 % of Europe's
                LNG supply.
                Construction is nearing completion in Algeciras, and the journey to the Adriatic offshore Italy is scheduled to
                occur in August.

                A second important energy source comes from the demand side of the global energy challenge. That
                .source," if you will, is more efficient use of energy.
                For those who might doubt the potential contributions of energy efficiency , consider this: Since 1970,
                reductions in energy intensity across the US economy helped to effectively meet well over half of Americans'
                growing energy demand . Efficient energy use extends the life of the world 's resource endowment. It reduces
                greenhouse-gas emissions. It helps drive down energy prices. And it strengthens energy security. Over the
                past 25 years, worldwide gains in energy efficiency have helped lower energy intensity by about I %
                annually.

                As a result, the global economy is growing more resilient to energy demand and supply shocks . Sudden
                changes in energy prices have less economicimpact because energy is a relatively smaller input to the goods
                and services the world produces than it was a quarter century ago. Energy efficiency as it relates to economic
                growth is often misunderstood . It does not mean doing less.
                Economies need energy to grow , and to deny this need is to deprive people, especially in developing
                countries, of the opportunity to achieve higher standards of living . Energy efficiency means using energy
                wisely - from employing advanced technologies to exercising common sense in using energy . It means doing
                the same -- or more - with less.

                Innovation plays a crucial role. ExxonMobil has systematically worked to improve efficiency and
                environmental performance throughout our facilities worldwide. Since 2004, ExxonMobil has invested more
                than $ 1.5 bn in activities that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and we will
                be spending at least half a billion dollars on additional initiatives over the next few years.
                Even greater efficiency gains are possible in the transportation sector , through both incremental and
                breakthrough innovations . While the quest for transportation replacement fuels that emit low to zero
                greenhouse-gas emissions continues , we must continue to provide ways for consumers to use the fuels
                available , gasoline and diesel, in ways that are more efficient , thereby resulting in lower greenhouse-gas
                emissions.

                ExxonMobil is partnering with engine and vehicle manufacturers to develop a number of transportation
                technologies that can improve fuel economy and reduce emissions - from lightweight plastics ... to materials
                that make tires lighter and keep them properly inflated and more efficient synthetic motor oils.
                We are also conducting a multi-year research effort in advanced engine technologies , such as Homogeneous
                Charge Compression Ignition, or HCCI. Success in these efforts could improve fuel economy of the internal-
                combustion engine by up to 30 %. To contribute to overcoming technical challenges to new vehicle systems,
                ExxonMobil has developed battery separator films to improve the safety and durability of lithium-ion batteries
                for use in hybrid and electric vehicles, and continues to refine and advance our on-board hydrogen reformer
                system that could lead to 80 % improvement in fuel economy and a 40 % reduction in greenhouse gases.

                The common element to bringing solutions to future supply and future demand challenges is technology:
                Technology development and technology deployment . International partnerships are essential to fostering
                technologies that increase supplies , strengthen security and reduce environmental impacts. No single source
                can meet the world's growing energy needs - and no single segment of our industry can either.
                Such partnerships are forged through the free flow of goods , services, capital and expertise across borders.
                Free trade and investment propel the energy-innovation cycle forward , bringing the best minds and the latest

                 tools to bear on the toughest challenges. Resource nationalism and the pursuit of "energy independence" can
                 interrupt this cycle, and slow the spread of economic progress that energy enables.

                 When energy prices are high, the temptation to break partnerships or cut ties can be strong , for both
                 producing and consuming countries. But it is a temptation that we must resist . Instead , we must strengthen
                 and sustain the global market for energy to meet the energy demand and supply challenges the world faces.
                 Free and fair competition on a worldwide scale is the hallmark of the Olympic Games . It also should be the
                 aim of all members of the World Petroleum Congress.

              Hi Gov. Palin,

              I can't imagine how busy you are and I'm not sure this will get to you but hope it does. I've got questions into your
              staff on this but would much rather hear from you directly. It would be terrific if you could give me five minutes on
              the phone or even just send back a quick note.

              I'm working on a story about your use of BlackBerries and Yahoo for e-mail. This was a small but brewing
              controversy in Alaska before you were picked by John McCain to be his running mate. The critics question
              whether you and others in your office are using private e-mail accounts for state business to get around public
              records law.

              How do you respond to those critics?

              I know you often have two BlackBerries going at once . Why is that? Is one for private and one for governor
              communications? Are they both also phones?

              You seem really tech-savvy. How do you describe yourself along those lines? Do you have an Pod? What's on
              your playlist these days?

              What e-mail providers do you routinely use? Mainly Yahoo? Any other private ones? How much state business do
              you do through your Yahoo account? Why use Yahoo and not your state account?

              Do you communicate to your staff members from your Yahoo account to their Yahoo accounts? Private to
              private?

              Coming at the issue a different way, how are your Yahoo e-mails or others from private accounts preserved, as a
              slice of history ? Do you save and archive them in some way? I can 't imagine you 'd have time to mess with that.
              Does an aide have your Yahoo password and do that for you? Or do the private account e-mails expire after so
              many days or weeks?

              Even if you intend for the public to see whatever communications should be public , how can that possibly work if
              things are in a private Yahoo account?

              Thanks for taking the time. It would be great to hear from you. The story would be more balanced and more

                Dear Gov. Sarah:

               I want to apologize for not sending anything to you in awhile. Please be assured that many people are
               praying for you and your family. We understand that the accuser of the brethren is not very happy with a
               Governor who dedicates the State to the purposes of God. The first dream that we sent you from Barb
               Pennington was about the media and the time of the fish. A sort time ago Cheryl Licht (her parents are
               Sr. Pastors at Crossroads) Wasilla had a dream that they were also going to attack Tod. They wanted
               you to know that they were praying for you. I run into people all the time who say the Lord has called
               them to personally intercede for you. There truly are more for you than are against you! We thank
               you for standing for righteousness and truth In our State!

                This dream came in from Pat Case of Homer.

                  Prophesy for Governor Palin:

                 On August 4th, while I was praying for the governor's administration the Lord
                 gave me a scripture for her!

                 2 Kings 6:12-23, which tells of the story of the plot to capture Elisha the prophe
                 I then began to seek the Lord for what this meant for the governor and He
                 showed me.

                 A plot is unfolding to ensnare you by those who are now against you. You have
                 some in your administration who that are now or shall become fearful, they mus
                 be reassured that those who are for you are much more than those who are not
                 The Lord will close the eyes of your attackers and allow you to lead them into th
                 hands of their enemies. When this happens you will have the power to destroy
                 forgive. It is very important that you show mercy and restore them with grace
                 and it will effectively end the attacks against you!

                 p.s. Sarah should re-read the scripture for herself as I feel the Lord has further
                 revelation to give her personally. It would also be helpful for her to revisit the
                 scripture the Lord gave me for her at the inauguration, (2 Peter 1:2-8).


                                                                                                                 12/22/2008

             Hi Gov. Palin,

             I can't imagine how busy you are and I'm not sure this will get to you but hope it does . I've got questions into your
             staff on this but would much rather hear from you directly . It would be terrific if you could give me five minutes on
             the phone or even just send back a quick note.

             I'm working on a story about your use of BlackBerries and Yahoo for e-mail. This was a small but brewing
             controversy in Alaska before you were picked by John McCain to be his running mate . The critics question
             whether you and others in your office are using private e-mail accounts for state business to get around public
             records law.

             How do you respond to those critics?

             I know you often have two BlackBerries going at once . Why is that? Is one for private and one for governor
             communications? Are they both also phones?

             You seem really tech-savvy . How do you describe yourself along those lines? Do you have an iPod ? What's on
             your playlist these days?

             What e-mail providers do you routinely use? Mainly Yahoo? Any other private ones? How much state business do
             you do through your Yahoo account? Why use Yahoo and not your state account?

             Do you communicate to your staff members from your Yahoo account to their Yahoo accounts ? Private to
             private?

             Coming at the issue a different way, how are your Yahoo a-mails or others from private accounts preserved, as a
             slice of history? Do you save and archive them in some way? I can 't imagine you'd have time to mess with that.
             Does an aide have your Yahoo password and do that for you? Or do the private account a -mails expire after so
             many days or weeks?

             Even if you intend for the public to see whatever communications should be public , how can that possibly work if
             things are in a private Yahoo account?

             Thanks for taking the time. It would be great to hear from you . The story would be more balanced and more
             complete. You know this topic better than anyone.

               Subject:      latest and greatest... look for it this Sunday

             AGIA remains the subject of a healthy debate. Many see it as a brilliant strategy, while some critics assure us that no project can
             move forward without the consent of North Slope Producers . Time will prove AGIA's merits, and one thing is for certain ; during
             her first year in office, Governor Palin has blazed the trail for Alaska 's first truly open and competitive process for building a
             natural gas pipeline.


             In the broadest sense, AGIA is designed to do two things : Move a project forward on a predictable timeline, and ensure an open-
             access pipeline . Nothing prevents Conoco Phillips from building a gasline - nor has anything prevented them for the past several
             decades . And yet, they have chosen not to. In their current public relations tour, Conoco makes it very clear that they do not
             require any of the incentives offered under AGIA . Why would the state want to give away $500 million when they will consider
             moving a project forward right now?! Never mind that this is all contingent on a number of preconditions.

             Conoco Phillips only wants one thing for this seemingly irresistible offer - to sit down again and discuss fiscal terms . But they did
             not suggest in their proposal what these terms might be. When this was pointed out in the Governor ' s recent letter to CEO, James
             Mulva, Conoco Phillips responded that they do in fact have some terms in mind , and they would be happy to share these in private
             just as soon as the Governor is ready to sit down and negotiate . Although the Governor goes on to explain in her letter why this is
             no longer a viable alternative, Conoco chooses to ignore it.


            The Governor also asked in her letter why Conoco chose not to commit their gas to their proposed project. What is interesting
            about Conoco' s answer is that they do not answer the question . Instead, Conoco takes the opportunity to point out that
            TransCanada hasn 't committed gas in their AGIA license application. Never mind the fact that TransCanada is not a gas producer
            and has no gas to commit - And never mind the fact that a gas commitment is the single largest thing Conoco could do to lessen
            the project risk and move a project forward.


            The questions people should be asking are, why? Why would Conoco Phillips choose to keep the project risk high? And why, if
            Conoco Philips needs none of the state incentives to move forward , would they make no effort to do so? And why would they
            choose to make their "proposal" public, just the day before AGIA's application deadline? In my mind, the answer is clear: fear.
            Conoco does not want the state to issue an AGIA license . They do not want a project to move forward on the state 's aggressive
            timeline and they do not want an open access pipeline.


            In reality, I do not believe Conoco is at all surprised that their "proposal" has not been taken seriously. It would be quite clear to
            anyone who has actually taken the time to read the document. Compared to any of the serious AGIA applications received by the
            state, it is a grade -schooler's guide to gasline risk . Conoco Philips is engaged in nothing more than an expensive campaign to
            obfuscate the AGIA process, and fuel the public's hope that after so many failed negotiations and stonewalling, the producers are
            finally ready to build us a gasline.


            Unfortunately, Conoco Phillips ' effort has been quite successful in their attempt to take attention from the AGIA process. Radio
            hosts , former statewide candidates, and other critics are swept along in the frenzy, but use their positions to level personal attacks
            on AGIA supporters, rather than debate the true merits of public policy. As this chapter continues to unfold, I would encourage
            Conoco to work with the Palin Administration towards our mutual goal of getting Alaska 's North Slope gas to market. And as for
            the rest, let's keep our dialogue civilized.

            Gov SP,
            Have you considered a national ad campaign from the State of Alaska to the Lower 48 about opening
            ANWR?
            It would be spendy, but now is the time.
            Can we discuss ? I can bring coffee unless you are in Juneau.

            Sure sorry about the current mud slinging. The real story is how the "brotherhood" of Troopers protect
            each other, too bad the ADN is lazy and would rather act like a British tabloid. Everyone I've talked to
            gets it, Pastor Bob especially, is really mad at the whole thing and the people related to it. Me too.
            Hows Trig???
            Love,
            JP

            Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to the citizens and get bills
            introduced in the state legislature in california florida and elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they should split
            the revenue stream with a specified amount (maybe half) going to the citizens as a direct benefit
            How much does each alaskan get?
            What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the citizens?
            Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?

            Would you be interested in writing or talking about this?
            Thanks

            Hello Governor Palin,

            I wanted to take this opportunity to write you regarding Chuck Kopp's appointment as Public Safety
            Commissioner. As we are all aware, there has been controversy surrounding your decision to remove the
            previous Commissioner and appoint Chuck to fill the vacancy.

            I do not know, nor do I need to know, the details that surrounded your decision to make this change . I feel that
            we, as Alaskans, elected and entrusted you with the responsibility to make decision in the best interest of the
            State of Alaska. With that being said, 1 trust that you have done what you deemed to be the best for our state in
            this case as well.

            What I would like to talk with you about is something, or rather someone I do know about... The Kopp family.
            Chuck, Trish and their children are precious people and I could not think of anyone with more integrity and
            leadership than Chuck Kopp to serve as Public Safety Commissioner. Chuck and Trish have given countless
            hours of their time to this community and lead by example in every aspect of their lives . They will be dearly
            missed on the Kenai Peninsula , but all Alaskans should feel very fortunate to have Chuck Kopp serving the
            State. I feel that Chuck has proven in his many years of service , as a member of the community , a son , husband,
            father and friend that he posses the qualifications to do this job and deserves the opportunity to do so.
           In closing , I just wanted to tell you and your family that I am sorry that the Palin and Kopp family have been
           attacked on a separate but personal level in all of this. I don't think anyone benefits from the "tabloid" information
           we have been dealt this week.

           I realize that you are under a tremendous amount of pressure, but I am asking that you continue to remain strong
           in your decision and give Chuck the opportunity to serve the State of Alaska.

           Thank you for all that you do for each Alaskan everyday,

           Jennifer Chumley
           Sterling, Alaska

            Hi Sarah, You won't hear this from any of your advisors so it's left to me. Oil companies respect
            strength. They respect an adversary that is willing to take them to the edge of the cliff, have them look
            over it to see the sharp rocks and then is willing to push them over if they don't get in line. You have
            shown the oil companies that you are willing to take them to the edge of the cliff. Now show them
            you're willing to push them off. As soon as AGIA passes have a meeting with big oil and show them a
            prefiled bill calling for a $2 billion/yr reserves tax effective 1/1/09. Tell them that they have until that
            date to work something out with Trans Canada. If they don't,the reserves tax goes into effect and
            remains there until our gas reaches market, 10-15 years from now. Then tell the
            owners ...Alaskans... that you plan on distributing $1.8 billion of that every year to each of the 600,000
            alaskans that recieve a permanent fund check keeping $200 million for the State to administer the
            program or spend elsewhere. That works out to about $3,000 each for Alaskans share. If Big Oil insists
            on warehousing our gas then we need to charge them rent. I don't know if you'll even get this but I don't
            want to send it anywhere else. Stay strong. Reeves

             Governor i am sending you this email to you to endorse and support your choice of chuck kopp as the new

             police chief of kenai and as a private citizen here on the kenai peninsula . he has dedicated many hours of his
             time to cook inlet academy as a parent and also as the school board president. He has worked thru out the
             community with non profits , womens resource center and other agencies to help make them work. He has
             worked hand in hand to help with cook inlet academy here on the kenai as a parent and also as the school board
             president. With his promotion as the commissioner of public safety for the state our loss of chuck will be a big
             gain for our state . There are dark forces Governor that want to bring you and your adminstration down and are
             looking for anything that they can do to fufill their vision . Chuck made a mistake and he has learned from it. we
             all make mistakes in life and i have too, but we all are stronger for it. Stick to your guns on this one governor. our

            Dear Governor Palin-

            I cannot say enough about the commitment to integrity I have personally witnessed in Chuck Kopp. He is honest,
            hard -working , responsible, and genuine . In his numerous roles of leadership , I have seen how he treats people's
            concerns with great consideration , while being firm enough in his convictions to never bow to undue influence.
            He is intuitive and very compassionate , and does not let fear keep him from doing the right thing. He is very
            engaging and affectionate , and although I have known him for many, many years and have personally received
            and witnessed numerous "hugs" there has never been anything inappropriate about them. I am sure as a female
            you have received appropriate and inappropriate hugs and that you know there is a difference. I don't know the
            woman who filed the complaint, but hopefully there is as much attention to her history and reputation as there is to
            Chuck's. I am a personal friend , first of Chuck, but also of his wife, with whom I have been close personally since
            their wedding in 1986 . Chuck loves his wife deeply and their marriage is one of those partnerships that really
            works. They are completely committed first and foremost to their marriage, so I do not fear that all of this negative
            publicity will harm it, but it is hard to see the reputation of some of the best, most self-sacrificing , hardworking and
            upstanding people I know dragged through the mud. I believe you have chosen the right man for this job . Please
            stand behind your decision to appoint Chuck Kopp as our State's Department of Public Safety Commisioner.

            Sincerely,
            Genevieve Smithwick

            I am writing in support of Chuck Kopp. I have known Chuck and his family for many
            years, and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about him . He is honest,
            trustworthy and a wonderful father and husband. Anyone who would slander him
            should be investigated themselves. I urge you and your staff to keep your full
            support behind him. Rica Phillips
