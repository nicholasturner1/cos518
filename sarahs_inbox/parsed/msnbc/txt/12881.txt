              What's a good date? Pls respond to Erika and just cc me in.



              If it's already set up for the 28th then that's fine, eh?

              Governor,

              I have Cabinet and Leg. Spouses names and addresses for mailing. Usually Commissioner's
             spouses are invited, but let me know what you prefer. I can send invitations out by Mon.
             at the earliest. Is Friday, March 28th the date?

               Thanks,

               Erika

              Todd- sounds like it's already set up. Ivy can help me entertain at the luncheon, it can
             be hosted by "Gov's Office", Russ should be in the loop as leg liason... Any other info
             anyone should proceed with?

               Governor,

                I'm a little confused about the luncheon. When Todd was in Jnu. He selected a date then
              changed it to possibly Fri. 3/28; I have emailed him and am waiting for him to confirm a
              date.  I have everything lined up and ready to go (invitations and addresses). Will this
              be something more then a lunch with round tables and floral center pieces?

                Thank you.

                Erika

               I still think a legislative spouses ' luncheon is a good idea- I'm happy to host it, and
             Ivy and Kris can help entertain (1). Kris may want to work the day in the Juneau office
             anyway on a variety of things.



                It could go a long way in building Leg relationships.



               Who wants to take this and run with it? Doesn't have to be a big darn deal, and I'd like
             it sooner rather than later. Thanks, all.
