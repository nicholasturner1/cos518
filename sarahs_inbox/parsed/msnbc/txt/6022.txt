         Thanks for your email Linda. I am praying for your hubby - and for strength and peace for
         you. Even, if possible, joy for you during this trying time. Please don't let me make your
         life any more stressful than it must be anyway right now.



         Truly, just holler if you see Admin do anything that's not by the book - but don't fret
         about work. Concentrate on your good husband and helping him heal.



         You are appreciated!



         Sarah

         Hello Governor,



         You do not need my permission to use the state credit card. We just

         need to know what you've used the card for to post a charge correctly,

         and we'll get that information from your secretary or whomever when we

         need it. Please feel free to check with me anytime you want to, but you

         certainly aren't required to.         You may also just may note what a charge

         is for on the back of the receipt and have staff send it to us. If you

                                                                1




                                                                                                          PRA_GSP01_0002811

          use the card for a personal rather than state or official charge, we

          will simply request reimbursement when appropriate.



          Thank you Governor,

          Linda
