            I got a call-back from KTLA the Fox affiliate in Los Angeles, with an invitation for you
            to appear on their morning show.




           Would be a chance to talk about AGIA and how AK energy can help California.



           I have also pitched the "women in political leadership " angle and they are interested in
           that as the Texas and Ohio primaries are on Tuesday.




           The timing would fit in your schedule - you would need to leave the hotel about 7: 30 a.m.
           to arrive at the studio and the 8: 45 interview.




           They are hoping for confirmation shortly.
