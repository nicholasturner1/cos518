           MESSAGE:

           You are an inspiration to us Mothers! I read about you and your 5th baby in the paper a
           few weeks ago. Congratulations!! What a very special gift from God.



           I read:

          "Children are the most precious and promising ingredient in this mixed-up world you live
          in. down there on Earth. Trig is no different, except he has one extra chromosome," Palin
          wrote.

          As for people who think a baby like Trig shouldn't even be born, look around, the governor
          wrote. Who is perfect or even normal?



          You "GO GIRL!!"
