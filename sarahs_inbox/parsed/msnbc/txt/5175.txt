                  Subject: RE: halibut

                Governor:

                 No, I do not support the decision by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) to reduce the sport
               . charter bag limit to one fish during part of the summer.

                The IPHC is not the appropriate venue to make these allocative decisions ; the North Pacific Fishery Management
                Council is (even though the Council has not effectively dealt with this issue recently).

                I don't blame commercial fishermen for going to the IPHC for action , since the North Pacific Council hasn 't acted,
                but still the Council is where this issue belongs.

                The one fish bag limit decision for parts of 2007 is an unnecessarily harsh measure for the sport charter
                businesses. If the IPHC felt compelled to take an action to reduce sport charter harvest, we had recommended
                that they consider some less onerous, but still effective, measures . Those included the action that we , ADF&G,
                have just taken to restrict skipper and crew on charter boats from fishing when paying clients are onboard. Other
                actions could have been establishing a bag limit of "one plus", which means one fish of any size plus another fish
                of some size greater than , say, 32 inches long.

                Anyway, Governor, the issue of sport charter harvests does need to be dealt with, but a few -day meeting of an
                international body such as the IPHC is not the proper way to gather and effectively deal with public input on a
                domestic fishery issue.

                I have written a letter to Alaska Regional Administrator of the National Marine Fisheries Service , Jim Balsiger
                (who is also an IPHC Commissioner), this past week outlining these concerns. We hope that there might be a
                way to have the federal government implement an alternative , and less onerous, restriction for sport charter
                harvests this summer.

                Please let me know if you need anything else.

                Take care, DL.
