  Kris - The Memorial Day Events:

  9th and I - was regretted.
  Ft. Richardson - was regretted.

  Gen. Campbell and Jerry Beale will be attending these events on behalf of Governor. I have asked that
  the draft agenda be corrected to state Jerry Beale will be reading proclamation on the 9th and I event.
  Wreath will also be presented at this event.

  *Note: McHugh Pierre has confirmed all events. They have copies of Proclamation and Wreaths to
  present.

  The Only Event listed on GOV calendar is the Wasilla Wall - Listed as FYI - I have not contacted Laura
  McCammon on this until I can give her a representative.

  Blackhawk - was regretted for Sunday, 05.25.08

  Thanks, Janice
