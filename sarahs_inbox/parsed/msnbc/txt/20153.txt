            Subject: Obama




            He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole out Energy Rebate
            $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking points, etc. So.... we need to take
            advantage of this a write a statement saying he's right on. (Glad he's flipflopping on
            OCS, too.)

            Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction " to some of Obama's
            good points this morning?
