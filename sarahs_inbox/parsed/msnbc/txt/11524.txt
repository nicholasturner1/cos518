              I'd rather use that one. What about all those AP shots that run often? Are they free for
              the taking for Fox?

              Governor-

               Believe it or not, aside from your official portrait, we don't have many pics of just you
              that were taken close enough to work for something like Fox News. We can certainly stick
              to the official portrait if that is what you like.

               Can they just use something the AP or AK business Monthly magazine already has?
