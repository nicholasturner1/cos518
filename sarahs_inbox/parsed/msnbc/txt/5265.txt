              I'll be meeting with Katz tomorrow with Tom and Pat, and then with FERC. I don't want to
              leave the FERC room without the commitments we need to go public with an expression of
              support, or at least viability, of our approach.              I'll call you later, Meg, to
              coordinate our messaging.

             You're right.

             Tibbles - can you get that ASAP, and/or talk to Katz ASAP on this! If you can't, please
             delgate it to someone else as soon as you possibly can. Meg can get a statement out that
             includes anything positive FERC can offer as soon as she receives it.



             We should have done this right when the report came out and naysayers began capitalizing
             on the statement that's been repeated now so often.



             Can you have Katz also put in writing what the three FERC persons reported to him about
             the true meaning of the report' s comments re: Alaska's slippage.



             please. ASAP. thanks.

            JUNEAU,
            <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/ news /national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/alaska/inde
            x.html?inline=nyt-geo> Alaska, - The new administration of Gov. Sarah Palin has been full
            of firsts. Ms. Palin,
            <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/republican_party/inde
            x.html?inline=nyt-org> a Republican, is Alaska's first female governor and, at 42, its
            youngest.

            She held her inauguration in frosty Fairbanks, a first that suited her conservative
            supporters but slighted the traditional host, this rainy, remote and less Republican state
            capital. She also appears to be the only governor in history whose spouse is a champion
            snowmobile racer and a former Arctic oil worker, and is widely referred to as First Dude.

            Now, two months after taking office, Ms. Palin wants to become the first Alaska governor
            to deliver what many others have sought without success : construction of a $30 billion
            pipeline to transport natural gas from the state's North Slope to markets in the lower 48
            states.

            It is an enormous project that could strengthen Alaska's energy-based economy for decades
            to come, while also, according to some estimates, supplying 7 percent of the nation's
            natural gas annually.

            But pulling off this first is shaping up to be more complicated.

            Elected by a wide margin after promising to bring new energy" and "transparency" to the
            pipeline project, Ms. Palin took office in December and immediately backed away from the
            negotiations that her predecessor,
            <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/frank_h_murkowski/index.html
            ?inline=nyt-per> Frank H..Murkowski, had been pursuing with the three major energy
            companies that control much of the land where gas would be developed.

            Ms. Palin has long criticized those negotiations as back-room dealings whose extensive
            incentives and tax breaks would have benefited the energy companies, BP, Exxon Mobil and
            ConocoPhillips, far more than they would have Alaska.

            "Don't get me started," she said in an interview in her Capitol office on Thursday.

            So next month, Ms. Palin intends to introduce the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, a bill
            that would open the bidding to new players, as well as the old ones. She says her plan
            would ensure new jobs and access to gas for state residents. She also says that whoever
            gets to control the pipeline must allow for its potential expansion so that other gas
            developers can use it at reasonable prices, thus encouraging more development.

            The new plan, however, would delay a formal agreement until next year at the earliest, and
            it would be another decade, until 2018, before the pipeline was in operation.

            Ms. Palin won votes last fall for vowing to take just such steps, but in taking them, she
            has stirred concern beyond Alaska at a time when the Bush administration says it wants to
            develop new sources of energy.

            In a report to Congress last month, the
            <http://topics.nyti,mes.com/top/ reference /timestopics/organizations/f/federal energy_regula
            tory_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said "the
            schedule for an Alaska gas pipeline has slipped considerably." The state's senior senator,
            <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/ reference /timestopics/people/s/ted_stevens/index.html?
            inline=nyt-per> Ted Stevens, a Republican famous for bringing big projects home, has
            openly expressed worry.

           And on Tuesday, Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, one of
           the companies that hopes to build the pipeline, said: "I don't really know where we are. I
           don't think it looks like Alaska knows where it wants to go, either."

           Ms. Palin dismissed that talk. But next week , when she attends a
           <http:// topics . nytimes . com/top / reference / timestopics / organizations /n/national_governors_as

                                                               3

             sociation/index.html?inline=nyt-org> National Governors Association meeting in Washington,
             she plans to visit Alaska's Congressional delegation and meet with officials at Exxon
             Mobil and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, among others. Besides putting minds at
             ease , she said, she wants to broaden the appeal of the project with the goal of gaining
             leverage in negotiations.

             "This project is so much bigger than Alaska and Alaska's interests ," Ms. Palin said. "This
             is for the nation. This is to supply domestically safe sources of fuel. We're going to be
             able to do that. We should be leading in a national energy plan."

             The report by the energy commission suggested just such thinking, although it had a more
             urgent tone than in earlier assessments and sprinkled in some skepticism.

            "The main obstacle to progress on an Alaskan gas pipeline is the failure to resolve state
            issues necessary before a project sponsor will commit to go forward," the report said.
            "The fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if Alaska
            gas is to be part of the nation's energy supply solution in the coming years."

            Steve Rinehart, a spokesman for BP Exploration Alaska, which controls the most land in the
            area expected to be developed first, said that with natural gas prices projected to stay
            relatively high and oil production on the North Slope declining, "the time has come to
            bring that gas to market."

             "It makes sense economically," Mr. Rinehart said .     " It makes sense for the life of this oil
             field."

            But in the past , aides to Ms . Palin said , the big energy companies refused to commit to
            expanding the pipeline or to allow outside companies to use it for reasonable fees.

            Mr. Rinehart disagreed . " We were ready to address those issues ," he said ,          " but the process
            stopped."

            Critical to pushing a plan through is the state' s 60-member , Republican-controlled
            Legislature . Mr. Murkowski , a former United States senator , clashed with state lawmakers
            over his pipeline plan through his final days in office. Ms. Palin, by contrast, has
            echoed their concerns about giving away too much in tax breaks to the energy companies.

            "What the governor has is a lot of credibility with the public," said State Representative
            John Harris , the speaker of the House . " She's been a breath of fresh air , in my opinion."

            Lyda Green , president of the Senate , said Ms . Palin came to office without the intimate
            knowledge of the energy and financial industries that Mr. Murkowski had. But "she's a very
            quick study," Ms. Green said . " She has good people around her."

            Ms. Palin has brought back some top staff members who left in protest over how Mr.
            Murkowski had been conducting the pipeline negotiations. Now she wants them to help her
            complete the deal that Mr. Murkowski never could.

            " We are crafting this whole process with our arms open , even for Exxon ," Ms. Palin said.
            "Come on in and let us know what you have in terms of a proposal to commercialize Alaska's
            natural gas."
