              So much for him not wanting to embarrass the Governor. Its so extremely apparent that it's all about Walt.
              He doesn't care how this affects her in the least. He's unfortunately doing the same thing he did when
              Begich let him go, right to the press.

              I have heard from a few folks regarding his email that he sent the cabinet and the feeling is that no matter
              the situation and the reason for him being replacement his statement to the rest about not having access
              and don't let it happen to you was so inappropriate, folks have taken offense to his statements.

              Mike-

              I talked with the Daily News tonight about Walt. Kyle was really pushing for specific
              reasons why Walt was let go. Apparently - Walt is telling reporters that he has all the
              respect for the Governor but is baffled as to why he was fired.
              I stuck to the company line but Kyle wanted more. He asked me to ask you for more
              details. I told him I would but didn't expect to get in touch with you tonight.

              SUBJECT: Largest Mat-Su/Chugiak firefighting apparatus on the way to California




              Today the National Interagency Command Center (NICC) formally requested Type I structural fire engines from Alaska for
              service in California's record breaking fire season . In response , the State Logistics Center in Fairbanks is coordinating the
              transfer of four of the largest structural firefighting engines to Cal Fire.



              Three of the trucks are being furnished by Mat-Su Emergency Services ; the fourth is being furnished by the Chugiak
              Volunteer fire department . Each engine will be staffed by a complement of 3 Mat-Su and Chugiak firefighters. The State
              Division of Forestry will be providing agency liaison Phillip Blydenburgh and mechanical support staff . Norm McDonald,
              Mat-Su Area fire management officer, states that this action shows terrific interagency cooperation. "To accomplish this
              mission, the Division of Forestry, the Mat-Su Borough, Chugiak Volunteer Fire Department , FEMA, NICC, and the US
              Forest Service all had to play their part". The engines will be transported through Canada on trucks and the crews will be re-
              united with their equipment in California.



              These Type 1 engines are capable of carrying up to 1500 gallons of water and pumping at a rate of 1000 gallons a minute.
              Chris Olson, logistics coordinator of the Division of Forestry's Coastal Region, states that the power of this apparatus is the
              ability to lay down a tremendous quantity of water in a very short time.



              All of the engines will be used by Cal Fire for structure protection . As of July 10th, there are still 97 outstanding, un-filled
              orders for structure protection engines for California.

              Governor,
              I just want to let you know that all the feedback the Gasline Team is now receiving is that the legislative discussion
              has shifted to politics and totally away from substance. While it is still important for us to present well in the
              hearings, at the end of the day that will not determine the vote. What has now happened is the "trading" that is
              occurring behind the scenes - energy relief money as an exchange for AGIA votes. In fact one of the reasons both
              the House and Senate are delaying the vote is that our opponents recognize they can use other issues to challenge
              our AGIA support, and the longer things roll-out the more danger we are in of losing the votes.

              Additionally, both bodies are now starting to jockey for leadership positions, which also complicates the situation.
              For instance, we hear an important Bush Democrat wants to be Speaker, so he doesn't want to completely irritate the
              House Republicans. This could result in a change in his position on the AGIA vote.

              I draw this to your attention in order to emphasize that the discussion is now much more complicated. We will
              continue to work all the issues and stay on top of things as best we can. And we will continue to be in touch with
              you.
              Thanks,
              Marty

                  As you well know, I am a solid advocate of the passage of AGIA!

                  I sent you another note just yesterday reaffirming that position!

                  You can attempt to speak for 138,000 voters if you wish, but not for me.

                  AGIA did not even exist in 2002.

                  Now I see you have already sent this ad with my name in it to all the 60 Legislators.

                  I demand that you send out to all of them IMMEDIATELY a retraction of my name in that ad with a true
                  explanation of my position stating you NEVER contacted me in any manner to use my name. And that I am
                  on the record many, many times as supporting AGIA's passage!

                  I will take all available immediate legal actions if you do not. Today.

                  I am astonished that you and this new "splinter group" of BB II, forming something new called BackBone III
                  would use my name in such a manner when you and all members of BackBone It know I do not support a NO
                  vote on the AGIA legislation! I do not see Mayor Jim Whitakers's name in the YES column. And he has
                  been in favor of AGIA for sometime now.

                  Fix this immediately. You all are and have already caused me great harm no doubt

                  Sincerely,

                  Scott R. Heyworth.

                  p.s. Lord help if this AD is ever published with my name in it whatsoever. I am not nor have ever been any
