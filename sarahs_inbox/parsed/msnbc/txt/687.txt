I heard that one member has been considering it but I don't think there has been an active effort to
get the board members to call a special meeting yet. If the idea is presented to the BOG, there may
be the support to call a joint board meeting. There is also a statewide BOG meeting in January and
although there is not a proposal yet from the Dept. or Ahtna dealing with the income test, it is
possible that something may come in prior to the November deadline to submit proposals.

Mike,



I heard a rumor today that the BOG is calling a

special meeting to have another vote on the

non-subsistence unit 13 hunting area ,is this true.
