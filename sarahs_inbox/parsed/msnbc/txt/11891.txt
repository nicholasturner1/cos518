             MESSAGE:

             I have a case with Alaska Human Rights since 1995. I appealed it to Alaska Supreme Court
             (ASC). The ASC ordered to go back to the Human Rights and explained in at least two
             situation that pretext is established in my discrimination case. Up to date I did not hear
             from Alaska Human Rights. It is almost now thirteen years since I filed my case. Do you
             have any feedback? How do I know when I can get a solution to my case? It should not take
             that long to reslove my case where discrimination is obvious. Please advise.

             Thank you

             Sincerely,

             Nada Raad
