Governor Palin,



I have lived in Alaska since 1971, 1 am 63 years old and I am so proud of the job you are doing.
Please do not let the lawmakers have any slack, if they can't truly justify their supplemental budget
requests then VETO them as you promised. Don't back up an inch, if you do, they will just keep
pressing you until they find that you will eventually cave and go along with them on this and future
things of the same nature.



I can not describe how good it feels to have someone like you leading us. My hat is off to your
parents for instilling into you what is right and wrong and for you to believe in yourself when making
those tough decisions that have to be made.



I would like to suggest that the money in the PFD be used to build the gas line and that all of us
become owners with a proportionate ownership of the profits.



Try to ignore Dan Fagen, he is just an outsider that is trying to make a name for himself here where
he could not do it elsewhere. =)



Congratulations on your baby to be.



Keep up the good work and don't give'm any slack.



Respectfully yours, David Bunnell
