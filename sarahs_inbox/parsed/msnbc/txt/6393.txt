              Subject: documentary
             Tomorrow at 12:30, Sprocketheads will be filming a quick sound byte of you at the airport. The location
             will be in the general vicinity of the Alaska Airlines check-in (they are unable to pin point exact until they
             are on-site). This is for a documentary that they are doing on Martin Buser. It will be brief, about 10
             minutes. They will ask you to comment on your friendship with Martin and what he means to Alaska.

             The gentleman's name is Steve. He said he has done work with you before.

             I also shared with Bob that it is not necessary for airport personnel to greet and escort.
