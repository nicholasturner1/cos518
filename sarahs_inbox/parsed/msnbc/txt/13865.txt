           Governor Palin:

           My name is Ken & I'm a Conservative Republican from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. I just
           finished reading a column in NewsMax regarding your name being mentioned as a
           consideration for the Vice President slot on the John McCain ticket. After reading your
           background governor,. whether or not you end up on the McCain ticket I will be keeping a
           sharp eye on your career because I really liked what I read. Along with Governor Jindal of
           Louisianna I believe you have a great future ahead of you & I hope to see you on a
           Presidential ticket somewhere down the line, if not this year. Best of luck in your career
           & God bless!

                                                  Respectfully,

                                               Kenneth E. MacAlister Jr.
