           Governor - We just received a scheduling request for you for tomorrow (Saturday) 08.16.08
           at 4:00 p.m. Location:  Heaven Farm in Wasilla.    I know that you are traveling and not
           able to meet this request but wanted you to know about it as they state they are family
           friends of the Heaths.




           Governor invited to speak at the Heaven Conservation Project Dedication and Ribbon
           Cutting.  This ceremony is honoring 40 acres of farmland that have been protected by
           future development.  The Alaska Farmland Trust Association assisted the Heaven Family in
           protecting this farmland.  Requestor:  Lisa Humphr
