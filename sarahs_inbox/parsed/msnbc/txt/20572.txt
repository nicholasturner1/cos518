                I am writing to express my disappointment in your leadership, or

           should I say misleading role in attempting to subvert the public

           initiative process regarding ballot initiative number four.                Perhaps

           you need be reminded we still think we live in a democracy in which

           the people have the right to petition the government and effect public

           policy where appointed officials in the eyes of the citizenry either

           fail or prove inadequate. Your disregard for the public process and

           attempts to spread propaganda on behalf of foreign mining interests

           defy the better judgement of the Department of Natural Resources, the

           citizens of Alaska and all those working tirelessly to protect

           Alaska's greatest resource, clean water.           Remember , as a public

           servant your interests should lie in serving the greatest good of the

           state.     Although you may not be immediately held accountable for your

           actions and professional failures you should understand it is

           behaviour such as yours which defy the public trust and degrade the

           credibility of your post and the Department of Natural             Resources as a

           whole.     The reasons for ballot initiative four is directly and

           specifically related to the incompetence demonstrated by your

           department under your supervision. Officials like yourself must be

           held accountable for breaking Alaska Laws. I urge your immediate

           resignation to demonstrate accountability within the Department of

           Natural Resources and to further indicate your error in judgement was

           not a flagrant abuse of power, that was knowingly in violation of

           Alaska Statutes and an assault on the public trust. You have

           compromised your credibility and integrity to act as Director of Large

                                                                 1

              The double standard we face in so many areas is almost comical . Despite other governors who spoke out
              personally and even in their position as gov, I was told this morning that APOC says I may no longer
              answer the question re: my opinion on the prop.

              The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair " manner, and cited several specific
              examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other election statutes, and
              a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair , the proponents of the ballot measure should have some
