          MESSAGE:

         Sarah.rnrnThe reason I support you is that you knew what to do instinctively when you saw
         wrong doing when you were in the Murkowski Gov.rnrnThat was you, no if ands or buts. It
         was honest and true.rnrnThe only way we can believe in our gov is if the truth and
         integrity of our representatives is open and tansparent.rnrnYour reputations of Sen
         Miller's bill is just a glad hand to the good old boy repubs that insist on killing and
         control of our resource's.rnrnl grew up hunting and trapping. I know what it is about. I
         have 155 acres in the valley and the poaching is out of control.rnrnMy cousin(Jim Grimes)
         had a lodge, Adventures Unlimited, at MP 35 of the Danali Highway. He hunted and trapped
         there since the mid 60's(Monihan Flats). rnrnThe hunters were demanding that we give them
         killing control over the wolves there. Well F&amp;G went in and did a study. While the
         hunters and trapper were saying it was the wolves that were destroying the moose, the
         study show it was the bears. I saw

         the study and the pictures.rnrnEven after the study was done, F&amp;G still did what the
         Alaska Ouddoor Council wanted and defied their on data.rnrnlOW,., don't urinate down my
         back and tell it's raining. rnrnThe fact is, the weather is the determinate of whether
         ungulates survive and not predator control. Weather = 70-90%.rnrnI voted twice to
         eliminate aerial hunting. On the radio last summer you said you would not go against
         citizens initiaves.rnrnl hope thats true.rnrnOur believe in our gov is in a very fragile
         state now. It CAN get worse.rnrnAll you need to do is be truthful and rely on us Citizens
         to know the difference.rnrnl'm afraid of the lack of determination of the best and most
         truthful Alaskans to deflect this stain on our great state.rnrnl worked for Arliss to get
         elected. Tell me why that liar Hickelrnthrew her over. rnrnWm R Harvey, Jr.
