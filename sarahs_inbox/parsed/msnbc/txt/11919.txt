            Anand was the Indian guy we walked by in the Hangar on the way to vote. He's your ETS
            director who works for Annette.

               Sharon had a good talk with NA After which Priv came to talk with me. She's excited, torn, thinking...I've encouraged her
               to give this positive consideration.

               I think her next move will be to try to get better defmition on a job description with Sharon. I know she counts the possibility
               of working for you as an honor and opportunity.

               She clearly wants to work with you, doesn't want to let you down, is concerned about how she might be welcomed in (not by
               you, but by the others on the communication team).

               Can't tell you which way she's going to go because she needs some time to process this. She's going to come out of a small,
               close-working office and she's trying to figure out what that looks like in your bigger office.

               Just a few of my observations based on the conversation I had with her.
