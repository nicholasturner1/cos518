                   This slide tells a good story about why we need to arrest the escalation of the past According to our number
                   crunchers , spending has escalated on average at 14% per year across the last five years . You can also see
                   where the forecasted revenue line goes in two years from now. Thought you should see it. Sean

                   Lt Governor Parnell,

                   Attached is a modified version of the slide that you requested from Karen Rehfeld . For your reference , I have also
                   included a slide which breaks down spending increases between FY04 and FY07 by major categories , in case
                   you get questions about what types of expenditures were driving the spending increases during that period. I have
                   attached a PowerPoint presentation with the 2 slides , as well an Adobe Acrobat version . The Adobe version may
                   be useful if you do not have access to PowerPoint during your travels.

                   If you have any follow up issues or questions , please contact me.

                   Thanks.

                  Karen,

                  During the last Cabinet meeting we saw a slide showing state GF spending over the last 9 years (back-to FY 99).
                  It was a bar chart. Can I get that PowerPoint slide and include a bar for the FY 08 budget init. I think it might tell a
                  good story about beginning to arrest the growth of state spending and would like to include it in a presentation to
                  some economic students in Fairbanks early next week. It would be interesting on another graph to show the
                  trajectory-if we maintained the average rate of spending growth from the last four years-across the next four
                  years FY 08, 09, 10, 11 and what that would look like. (Something we don't want to do but want to show what it
                  would look like and compare ourselves to it).

                  That may be a partial way for the governor to get her arms around setting spending limits for our administration. I
                  know she doesn't want to replicate the upward spending trajectory of the last four years. Thanks.

                    lands in the Mat-Su Valley.
