                Governor-

                The London Times has an interesting question to pose to you-

                "Why would the governor of Alaska , with her reputation for political smarts and independence, risk
                her 85 % approval ratings fighting against the registration of polar bears as an endangered species
                - when all indicators are It will happen sooner or later?" I suppose supplementary questions include
                what practical steps will she take to maintain her position - more DC lobbying ? - and what would it
                cost Alaska if the bears are protected over the next few weeks or months?

                They would like 10 minutes with you this afternoon . Thoughts? (They have a huge circulation)
