            At 10:00 this morning, it will be announced that Exxon has agreed to sell a 10 year supply
            of gas to Fairbanks Natural Gas. FNG will praise the governor's support of the in-state
            has tax provisions in aces in their release. Exxon is expected to say they are perfectly
            willing to make their gas available.



             Assuming tap and placement issues can be worked out very soon, FNG expects to have a
            project going in about 16 months.
