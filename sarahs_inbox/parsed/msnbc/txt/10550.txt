       I     Governor - I have updated calendar to reflect Wal-Mart Event for today:



             Location:  Wal-Mart Store - 8900 Old Seward Hwy. - ENTER Front of Store - South end by
             McDonald's




             2:00 p.m. beginning of event. Wal-Mart will present check of $25,000 (500 gift cards) to
             the Salvation Army.  The Wal-Mart Manager is Marty Howard. Marty is celebrating 27 years
             with Wal-Mart.  Major Doug Pollerud, Salvation Army Divisional Commander will be accepting
             the check for the Salvation Army.



             They have chosen various families: Some work for the National Guard, one is a single
             mother of five, a child with cancer, etc.



             They will present check 02:00 p.m. - hope to have gift cards in the families hands by
             2:10/2:15 p.m.  Shopping will then begin. If the Governor could help the families shop.
             I have stressed that since this was just asked of the Governor to be present during this
             time that she not expected to give a speech. They may want her to say "Thank you." I
             have also stressed that the Governor has other commitments and only has approx. 45 - 60
             minutes for this event. They understand that when she needs to depart that is fine.
