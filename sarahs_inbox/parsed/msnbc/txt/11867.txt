             Dear Governor Palin:



             I am not in support of the proposed plan to give each Alaskan part of our

             budget surplus in a check .       We need to fully fund our PERS / TRS systems,

             pay down our debt ,    fund maintenance and repairs on state facilities, and

             increae the CB reserve .      We already have one of the lowest tax burdens in

             the country.    Let's think longer term than the next election.           Thanks for

             trying to defeat this bad idea .       Sandy McKinnis



             Sincerely,




             Sandra McKinnis
