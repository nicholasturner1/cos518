            Joe- So how does this work with Ralph Samuels spending three days with FERC in DC
            recently? Any influence there?

            Sorry, I dont know what its about. I suspect it is one of two things, though. Either an
            announcement that they are filing paperwork with FERC under the pre-application process or
            that Enbridge is joining the Denali group.

              They are announcing at 10:00 a.m. Which only gave us a 20 minute window to call - 9:00 -
             9:20 a.m.  Janice

              Governor - I just received a phone call from Jim Bowles office. Mr. Bowles is requesting
             to speak with you via phone before 9:20 a.m. today, Wed., 04.30.08. They have two
             announcements that they will be making at 10:00 a.m. and wanted to make sure you knew
             before the public announcement.  Mr. Bowles can be reached via his cell PI'IVlle  or we can
             set up a call for afternoon (but announcement will have been made). Janice
