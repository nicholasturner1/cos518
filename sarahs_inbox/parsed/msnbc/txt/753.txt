  Hello,

  Of course I'm already thinking of food while the family is in town for the Open House. Just send me a
  shopping list if you'd like to have things purchased in advance. We'll need to purchase items for the Open
  House, so we'll be shopping at Foodland (A&P) and Costco. Let me know if you'd like steaks, chicken,
  etc.. prepared for when you arrive on Wednesday.

  Thank you,
  Erika
