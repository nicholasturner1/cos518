             You bet, Governor. We're on it. We'll have a final for you to look at

             by tomorrow afternoon, I'm hoping. Maybe we can give Matt Z a call and

             give him a heads up that it's coming. He will definitely allow us to

             respond.

             Governor , here is my op-ed for Kris' signature . I've sent it around to

             others for their feedback , so there will likely be changes. Just wanted

             you to see what I've got so far.
