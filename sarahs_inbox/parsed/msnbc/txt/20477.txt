             I will get with mike in the morning to discuss further. I will talk to you further in person on this in the
             morning.

             We worked out a search process today that I believe should work for everyone. Basically it is as follows:

               1.     Branchflower does not get possession of any electronic device.
               2.     The agency performs the search and compiles a log of documents that are confidential.
               3.     Then.Law reviews the remaining docs and compiles a log of docs that are privileged.
               4.     Branchflower gets the remaining docs and the two logs.

             He indicated he has no intent to search personal e-mail accounts , but wants to use personal e-mail
             addresses as search terms for dots on state accounts but only if that person uses their personal e-mail
             address for official business.

             We can discuss whenever convenient

             No worries about today's phone call.

             Mike B.

              Governor - I just tried to call you. Anyways, after receiving your first email tonight I called Kami directly
              and asked who went to the Governor's house to the bedroom computer. Kami is the number one IT
              person for us so I knew that she would know. Kami stated that she was directed by Mike Nizich to do this
              as it was requested by the department of law she thought She had another IT staff meet her to carry the
              computer. The hard drive was copied and then returned to the bedroom. Apparently Kami was asked to
              do this after the reception that took pace on August 2nd. Janice

              No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as its not
              comforting at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who
              went to the bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th
              event that occurred while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

              Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor 's office computer
              folks and they went in on Monday, August 4th . They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not
              available at the time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to. copy the hard drive . It was then returned
              back to the house. All of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the
              department of law had asked for this. Janice

              If anyone has an answer, pis let me know asap:
              I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails
              from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom 's computer and the other house computer?
              And what were the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on
              whatever day it was that this occurred. Thank you

              Governor - I am copying Mike Nizich in on this issue as I was not told that this was taking place. I was
              referring to Kami Clark which is our IT folk that had been asked to do this. Janice
