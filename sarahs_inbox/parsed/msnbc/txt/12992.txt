            Any idea if Ak Air has a seat available on the 11-ish flt today, instead of me waiting for
            the late flt I'd better get to Juneau sooner. If you could look, that'd be great. Thanks
            (I already let janice know to try finding a seat, but most time security has that
            automatic "they're full" reply)
