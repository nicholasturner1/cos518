          Okay, Governor. We will work with Karen on that messaging for the release.

          Not sure how/why last year the decision was made to have the big "to-do" press conf to
          announce vetoes - don't want to do that this year. It sent a message of drama and
          political gamesmanship. (Perhaps we did it that way last be it was the new admin's first
          budget?)



          So this year, tho I see it's been scheduled as another press conf, I won't be standing at
          a podium telling lawmakers in dramatic form what I just chopped from their budget.



          Instead, we'll release it with very solid and positive messaging in a good statement,
          minus the spotlight.



          We have the AGIA spotlight that overshadows vetoes this week. In studying preliminary AGIA
          work product the past few evenings, it's very, very apparent the necessity to focus on
          that for alaska's future versus getting sucked into veto drama that critics would like to
          see distract from AGIA this week.
