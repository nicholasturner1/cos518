            Here's another one resigning from a board due to the requirement of disclosing
            competitive/proprietary information under new ethics law. Just wanted you to be aware.
            (Not sure she knows she's still required to file for 2007 under the law, but I've been
            hearing more of this kind of response . She does thank you, Governor, for giving her the
            opportunity to serve.) No response necessary at this point to my email, just a heads up.

             Dear Click and Andy:

            With great regret I have made the decision to resign my position on the Alaska Workforce
            Investment Board (AWIB ), representing Private Sector.

            This was not by any means , a decision taken lightly.  The changes by Alaska State
            Legislators in 2007 regarding public disclosure affecting volunteers appointed to seats on
            Boards and Commissions has a negative outcome to those who choose to volunteer their time.
            As business owner / partner of multiple Human Resource Consulting companies it would not
            be a prudent business decision to release information regarding our clients as required in
            the 2008 12 page financial disclosure by the APOC. This was not a decision regarding
            personal finances as it- concerns our business partners and clients.  We sign
            confidentiality statements with our clients, who may or may not choose to divulge the
            nature of our sometimes very sensitive work.

            My family and business partners have taken extra precautionary measures to protect us
            against identity theft.  Knowing this information will soon be available to every "Google"
            aficionado is disconcerting to say the least and will disclose proprietary information.

            I would like to thank Governor Palin, Commissioner Click Bishop and all of those concerned
            for extending my appointment to the AWIB and regret that, in good conscience; I cannot
            serve out my term. These are very exciting times for the AWIB with the current
            Administration lending strong support for the advancement of a qualified trained workforce
            in Alaska. I will continue to work for the same goals by retaining a volunteer position
            on the AVTEC Advisory Board.



            Sincerely,

            Susan G. Denison , Partner
