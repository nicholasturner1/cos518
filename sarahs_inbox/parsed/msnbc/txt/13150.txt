            Russ- if you get a chance to talk to Gara or Lynn, let them know I do support their
            efforts on divestment. I haven't known what they needed of me, but I'm not impressed with
            Mike Burns avoiding the question and giving Alaskans the of "not available for comment"
            comment.



            If asked, I'm telling Alaskans I still desire to have the conversation with Burns to let
            him know my take on this (but he hasn't expressed interest in knowing what I'd like to do
            on this issue) and I side with those who believe our "bottom line" shouldn"t be our sole
            global concern in this matter.



            If I can do anything to help those lawmakers, even if it's just taking a public stand on
            this, I'll do so. They can suggest ways I could help. Thanks
