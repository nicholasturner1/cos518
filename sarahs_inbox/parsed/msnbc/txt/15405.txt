              Subject: Charter Industry Ad in ABM
             Hello Denby,
             Attached is an ad that the charter industry has sponsored in the Alaska Business Magazine. It will be
             running during June, and possibly through out the summer months. It will start being distributed within the
             next week.
             The ad is the result of our feeling that the State has been less than responsive and responsible to its
             coastal community residents with its lack of preventive action taken on the one fish issue, and
             recreational halibut allocation in general.
             We are sending the ad to you so should friends, neighbors or business associates see it, and ask you
             about it, you will knowledge of what it is.

             Bob Howard, President
             Alaska Charter Association.
