            Press /Alaskans may need to hear about this - it's a major ploy to distract and sink AGIA.

            Can't believe others didn't see that and that anyone would want to go along with this...
            and this info hadnt been passed on to us.

             Governor - the back up was due today but they have had to extend. Latest we heard is that
            we will'not get the back up until the bill is transmitted. I do not know when that will
            happen but expect it within the next week to ten days. I believe the legislature will want
            you to have to act while they are in special session.

            about the timeline for the bill before cabinet on Thursday. KJR

              I thought back up info was due today ? Also- when can I expect to be handed the budget,
            thus giving me the ticking 20 day clock for vetoes?
