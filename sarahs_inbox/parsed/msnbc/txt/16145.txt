           Governor -




           I just received a phone call from Kelly regarding a requested meeting for tomorrow,
           Tuesday, 06.17.08 at approx. 1:30 p.m. This would be in regards to Energy Legislation.
           We had tried to have it in JNU but attendees were not available then.




           Attendees:        GOV, Haggeson, Balash, Goode, Stedman, Hoffman, Meyer, Chenault, Green,
           Harris.  The meeting should last approx. 30 minutes.




           Thanks, Janice
