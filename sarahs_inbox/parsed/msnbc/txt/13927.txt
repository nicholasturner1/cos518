             Will do. (On another topic, Mort was walking around the Anch airport this morning , saw me,
             and was in a slight tizzy about your 2 pm ?? airport meeting. I don't know enough to
             comment just wanted you to know he thinks Ak Airlines is off base seeking cont "subsidy"
             from cargo carriers--his words.

             I still like the idea of you sitting around the table with reporters on this today if you
             can. I see Gene T at 3:30 today. Do you want me to communicate with or ask him anything???

              Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill McAllister, Stephen M.,
             Kristina?? On the second floor about the capital budget - told them there are significant
             items missing that are basic health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some
             examples like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big
             differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED grants -
             approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly there has to be a
             responsible budget by the end and that we will continue to work toward that.



              They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental - told them we still
             have a few more meetings with legislators - that I didn't think we would be able to do
             much before Thursday -

              We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't let their issues
             go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are working on it.

               Governor-




               I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

               could cover budget items as well as CON.

              Great work last night that resulted in that very , very valuable list

              that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

              screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks . I am ready

              to talk to reporters about this - it's absolutely unacceptable and

              outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what ' s going on here so they can

              pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
