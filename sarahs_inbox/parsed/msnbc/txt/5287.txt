               Governor Palin,

               I hope you are having a good trip. I wanted to let you know we've had inquiries from legislators regarding serving
               on the Health Council . Rep Doll , in particular, would like to serve . I wanted to run it by you and Commissioner
               Jackson before I respond to their office.

               Thanks,

               Ivy Frye
