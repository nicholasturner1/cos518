              Governor,




               I just found the awesomest house right on the river in the valley. The guy said he would
              rent it to me, but I'm hesitant to give him my current landlords contact info b/c we don't
              particularly get along. Would you mind vouching for me? Trust me, the girls are going to
              love this place--you too, if you ever want to get off the beaten path.
