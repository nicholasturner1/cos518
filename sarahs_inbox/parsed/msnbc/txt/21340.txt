              John- did Mike make sure Tom and Marty were in this loop? I didn't see their names on any
              cc's in the links of emails... and that's odd as they lead the gasline team. I haven't
              spoken with Mike yet about this issue- and I'm not sure within these links who wrote me a
              memo on the topic at the request of Mike?



              i'11 go ahead and cc in Tom and Marty and I'll ask Mike what the foundation is on this -
              it got confusing trying to follow the links.



             Bottom line- did I say something wrong in the speech? What was it and who caught it, etc?

             exports.  I suspect that we would get a similar response from other = nooks and crannies
             of DC if we asked the question. The reasons for = this posture are political and optical;
