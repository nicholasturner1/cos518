             Wants KWHL to throw me a baby shower. I say "yes", if the gifts can go to these young Army
             wives who don't have much, they're far from their families, the dads aren't there for the
             newborns first months, etc. And now Ft. Wainwright's aviation unit was notified of a four
             month extension on deployments. would u assign someone to work with Bob on that angle?
             Thanks
