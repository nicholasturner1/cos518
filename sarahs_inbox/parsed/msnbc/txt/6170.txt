         She hasn't.  I was looking for someone in local govt. records so I asked Steve what he
         knew about her.

        Hi Ivy,   If you get a comfortable opportunity, please let Gov Palin know that I am making
        myself available to fill the vacancy being left by Vic and currently going through the
        District procedure to get my name forwarded.      I am a little surprised at the level of
        interest by others, but I do feel I can fill the hole with the least "bump" when I look at
        other applicants so I am pressing on until I hit a wall.    I will certainly respect any
        appointment Sarah makes---    but I want her to know I am in the running... and I'm open
        to your advice if you have any.       There should be an interview tomorrow, and a short
        speech on Friday and a decision by District on who's names to forward shortly thereafter.



        Thanks



        wes
