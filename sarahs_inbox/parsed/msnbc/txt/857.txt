ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- In a poll conducted Tuesday, Jan. 29, Channel 2 News asked viewers
whether they thought former Gov. Frank Murkowski can negotiate a gas pipeline deal for Alaska.

An overwhelming majority of respondents think Murkowski's input won't help.

Do you think former Gov. Frank Murkowski can help Alaska negotiate a gas pipeline agreement?
