           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:




           I saw you on Glenn Beck's show this week, and I was really impressed with you. It is so
           refreshing to hear someone speak in a common sense manner. Your views on Anwar et al were
           right on, and I applaud you for stating it so well. I wish there were more governors like
           you.  You would make an excellent president (forget being VP)!!




           God's blessing on you and your family, and congratulations on your latest child.




           Keep up the good work!


                                                                 1
