              Hi Cathie,




              It was great to see you this week.



              I saw that the deputy director of AOGA is speaking at the Juneau Chamber luncheon today.
              I hope Governor Palin's gasline team would also be invited to speak to your members in the
              near future to talk about ACES. The AOGA executive director is on record in opposition of
              changing the tax structure and it would be helpful, I think, for Juneau residents to hear
              both sides of the argument. Perhaps they've already been invited?




              Thanks for your time,



              Ivy
