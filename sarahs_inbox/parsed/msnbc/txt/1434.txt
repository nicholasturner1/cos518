Todd,



I asked Janice Mason to put this report on our trip to Togiak in the Governor's weekly reading file. It's
not urgent, but I thought you would find it of interest since you're from the region.



Apparently the banishment issue is still festering -- with documents going back and forth between the
Togiak Traditional Council and the Police Chief.



Thanks,



Rhonda
