            Larry has great advice here - we're soooo missing the boat on communicating good messages
            to Alaskans thru the press.



            You know who I appreciate trying to help on this? and I hope you can appreciate this
            also: Ivy's doing an awesome job calling reporters on the carpet and diplomatically giving
            them the truth... Her efforts have been 100-percent successful and it's why I encouraged
            bringing her into the fold more closely with Communications. Privileged or Personal Material Red

            Fairbanks Newsminer is mischaracterizing our position and statements on

            earmarks - today ' s editorial is so off base that we need to submit a

            letter to the ed, or an op-ed , along the lines of our Carl Marrs

            response . None of us have said earmarks are what these editors claim

           we've suggested.



           John- would you rewrite the Marrs response for the Newsminer?

             earmark requests (for their own good too), and they're letting our

             efforts bite us in the butt. I spoke with Lisa about this yest at the

             Iditarod start, thanked her for her understanding of where we are on

             this, and had a good conversation with her saying she knows we're trying

             to do the right thing on this. We'll have lunch in two weeks when she's

             back up.
