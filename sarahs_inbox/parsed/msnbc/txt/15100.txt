            Governor,



            To keep you in the loop... It looks like the event will affect production for up to 3
            days. PSIO will continue to seek updates as we go along.



            If it only lasts 3 days, our FY2008 production forecast will still be good.




           -Pat

           FYI, see below .     It looks like a 1 to 3 day impact . It's great to see DNR & DOR working
           this together...



           Also, I think we're all in agreement that the state not launch a press release until after
           the company does. But we get one out immediately after with the bullets mentioned
           previously.



           Finally, our production forecast anticipated some shut-downs and was ahead before this
           event.  As long as the event does not exceed three days, our FY2008 production forecast is
           still good.  So this update is a positive sign.



           -Pat

           I just got off the phone with Bernard Hajny, BP's Tax Manager. Here's what he told me:



           -The disruption of power affected the 6 Prudhoe processing plants. As I understand it,
           this means the 3 Flow Stations on the Eastern side and the 3 Gathering Centers on the
           Western side. All production that goes through these stations were shut in. This LIKELY
           includes the volumes going through the Endicott pipeline as those volumes come from Flow
           Station 2, but Bernard could not confirm that.




           -It did NOT impact BP's other operations : GPMA, Milne , Northstar , Endicott



           -5 of the 7 generators at the Central Power Station are up with enough power restored to
           start getting the 6 processing stations restored.



           -BP expects to have 3 of the processing stations restored today and the other 3 by the end
           of tomorrow.



           -Bernard said to expect volumes to be down drastically today, with ramping up production
           over the 1-3 days.




           If you have other questions , I can forward them on to Bernard.
