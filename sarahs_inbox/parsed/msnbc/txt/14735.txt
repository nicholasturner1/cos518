           She's on vacation for two weeks so maybe she wrote both Ears earlier.

           Sharon- any idea why Shelia has referenced twice now "the nasty letter Sarah wrote to
          Lyda" (she's refering to the letter Tibbles and Balash wrote to her on April 18, I
          presume)? What was perceived as so nasty about it I wonder?



           I did ask the guys if they wanted to put their name on it when they presented it to me
          for my signature - of course they wouldn't - but the last few communications from the guys
          to Lyda, with my signature, sure have been capitalized upon by Shelia. Guess this is a
          lesson that the letters could have been tweaked more - but any idea why Shelia perceives
          them as she has?

                                                               1
