            Governor Palin,



            Attached are the remarks and event info for the Marine deployment ceremony. I have
            included information about the Marines who are deploying that I think will provide you
            with valuable context.  As they've rearranged the entire event due to the earlier
            deployment time, the ceremony now centers around your remarks, where before, your speaking
            role would have been paired with an awards ceremony. As such, the event will be
            considerably shorter, and I would recommend that, if your schedule permits, you spend 5-10
            minutes meeting the Marines and their families. FYI, the average age of those being
            deployed is 21, 85% are single, 80% are first time deployed, and all are male.    I will
            provide you with a briefing booklet tomorrow morning. Please let me know if you have any
            questions, and also, please thank Track for his service to our country. Happy Memorial
            Day!



            Thank you,




            Kate Morgan
