                Fyi- congressman hall from texas is introducing a bill that would transfer ownership of ANWR from the
                feds to the state. Pm on record supporting the idea and his bill. It may be an interesting subject for
                alaskans to hear about. I've promised expedited development if the transfer were ever to take place.

                NPR-A. I think he's right-on.
