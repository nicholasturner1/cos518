         Sorry I missed this one over the weekend. When I met with Leo on Friday, we talked about
         [Privileged or Personal Material Redacted         He had his resume on the top of his desk (without
         me having to bring up the issue . He told me that he is working on setting up a time for
         the two of them to get together. Leo will be in Juneau tomorrow and I have a follow up
         meeting with him on a number of issues . I will ask him for an update and reply back
         again.



         Mike
