  Subject : Cowdery Chronicles - HB281
 Another Ear item but I know its past your deadline. Cowdery was the ONLY vote against Bob
 Lynn's HB281 that passed the Senate 19-1. It had already passed the House 39-0. So out of 59
 possible votes (Foster was out due medical for that vote) ... Cowdery was the only Legislator to
 vote against it.

 Funny, but I can't figure out why he'd be against revealing who gives him cash??
