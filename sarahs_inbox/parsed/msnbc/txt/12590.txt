            I wanted to make sure that you had seen this. Implicating the State is not fair or
            accurate, but I'm not sure how many of these we can respond to.

           Denali Commission on shaky ground. Sen. Ted Stevens says the commission he created that
           has been responsible for pumping tens of millions of dollars into Alaska projects, most of
           them rural, faces an uncertain future, according to an
           <http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/030208/horn 20080302002.shtml> Alaska Journal of
           Commerce story. Federal funding cuts and slim contributions from the state are putting it
           in jeopardy, he told the paper.

            The commission has about $ 110 million to spend this year, down from $ 130 million last year
            and $150 million three years ago, the story says. Gov. Sarah Palin has said she backs the
            commission but has made no commitments so far, according to co - chair George Cannelos, co-
            chair of the commission.
