           OK, Thursday afternoon probably would work . Should I set up a meeting ? And would that be
           me, Sharon and Beth , and you too , or just Sharon , Beth and me? Just let me know. I'm
           signing off for the evening and will be in the office all day tomorrow.

            Ok let ' s add to your agenda while you're up : would you meet with Sharon and Beth (Meg
           isn't back from baby yet) and we can get a refresher on when to jump , when to chill.



            If our offices are full , camp out in my office . I have the conference table.

           Actually, I will be in Anchorage this week for some personal stuff (two crowns and a
          panel discussion on my former life as an ombudsman investigator). I'll be in town late
          Wednesday night through early Sunday morning. I believe I'll be in the office at 11 a.m.
          Thursday to participate in a phone meeting with Katz and the lieutenant governor and
          aviation issues.\

           I'm in New Orleans for IOGCC. Rick Perry relinquished his chairmanship and I inherited.
          I'll type more later.



           When are you coming up?
