          Good idea. Randy- pls jot a quick note letting Privilege know the circumstances of that
          email, and that by the time I saw it we were already checking. Then Holland can see the
          facts surrounding.

                                     Privileged   sent the email, Meg Holland asked me to

          get her a copy. I left a message w/ Meg asking what her a name to track

                                     Privileged   called me. I talked with         Privile ed   for a

          few minutes and told I would pass along her information .                So in fact, we

                                               Privileged   called me - Meg gave her my #.



          Meg knows that when anemail comes to the state's website it gets routed

          and handled by a special assistant. She also knows that each email get

          a generic response letting them know it will be routed. I believe this

          email was routed to boards and commissions.



          Just a thought, rather than issue a statement that will generate another

                                                                                       Privilege 's

          Sharon- did Holland even bother to ask if I received        Privileged 's   emails?

          Please explain to her the issue re: it seing sent to general state gov

          account it did NOT get to me until many days later- by then we were

          taking action . Randy and/or others can more fully explain what happened

          to that email.

           Sharon- I don't think ADN was ever corrected re: what happened to

           Privileged 's   email she sent (offering to have me look at her files against

           Kopp),back on july 13. We need to explain I never saw that email until I

           traveled to Juneau amny days later,     heard rumors there was one, so Kelly

           and I did our own investigating of emails until we finally found it...

           and by then we were advised not to contact her as wheels were in motion.

           The ADN writes about this as if I purposefully ignored the accuser's

           offer. to provide me more information. Megan further reports in a series

           of quesions on-line that I must be asked "why no response ", all based on

           Privileged   s email , and it's reported she had a follow up phone call to

     i     the gov's office and yet no response from me?

             .    We need a statement on that - and again internally a strong reminder

           that recipients of volitile emails like that must be forwarded to

           appropriate personnel. (In fact, Mike, please do a memo on that to all

           admin assistants ... this was a harsh lesson to have learned re:

           receptionists needing to use discernment on forwarding significant

           emails that seem pretty obvious to me they should be forwarded.)

                 That one needs clarification be it could lead to potential legal

           trouble if it's assumed I received the accuser's email yet did nothing

           in response. (This email evidently was forwarded to three different

           depts, I believe)
