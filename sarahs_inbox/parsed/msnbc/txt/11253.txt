                Honorable Governor Palin:

               This email Is in response to my earlier email request and to follow -up on my written request to your office
               to include within your budget 11 million dollars for the Reynolds Creek Hydroelectric Project.   I am
               currently In Juneau seeking funding for the Reynolds Creek Hydroelectric project and I have had
               productive and receptive meetings with your special assistants and commissioners . I have met with
               Commissioner Notti, Mike Black, Joe Balush, Lynne Smith and Joellen Hanrahan . I would like to
               commend them for their efforts in listening to the rural concerns and providing me with the opportunity
               to work towards making our communities on Prince of Wales viable economic entities.

               I would like to add Karen Rehfeld' s staff has gone above and beyond in their response to my requests.
               While I was frustrated with actually meeting with Karen her staff has accommodated my requests. I
               would like to let you know I owe a personnel thank you to Joeleen Hanrahan , OMB's Management
               Analyst.

               I have hand delivered my request to your office in a letter dated January 15, 2008 with a copy to OMB,
               Commissioner Notti, Joe Balush and my local legislators.

               In closing, Governor Palin, I want to extend a special Invitation for you to attend the village of Hydaburg's
               summit, March 28, 2008, Friday, in Hydaburg , titled " Strategies to Promote Economic Development and
               Capacity Building ". I am excited to extend this invitation because my daughter Marlssa Edenshaw, who
               attends Mt. Edgecumbe, and who has met with you on energy concerns , will be co-hosting as a state-
               wide student government representative . I asked Marissa how I could get you to attend and she said to
               ask you . Please accept this as my personal invitation.

               I am going to keep working diligently to have the Reynolds Creek Project funded . This is our future
               economic hope for my children,·for my community and for the entire Prince of Wales island . I do not
               believe the timing or the opportunity for our community to obtain funding to make our Island a viable
               economic center will happen without your help this session. The politics are thick and I'm not a
               politician . I am simply a person trying to make a change In my community and for the future of my
               children's children.

               I hope to hear from you personally , Sarah, as this is the only way I know to communicate with you.

               Please give me a call at 907 229 1540 so I can speak to you.

               Hawaa--Thank you.
