                 Subject: Board of Fish and Kenai River regs
                Tom,
                You asked when the Board of Fish meeting occurs as they will take up proposals on 50 hp regs. BOF
                meets from February 1-12 with the Kenai River proposals scheduled on the draft agenda currently on
                Feb. 4 and 7. They're looking for direction from us so they can follow suit is what I'm being told.

                Perhaps we can take 15 minutes with the governor ahead of the Habitat meeting to discuss the direction
                she wants to head. I'll forward this to Janice , requesting she check on the governor's availability.

                Sean
