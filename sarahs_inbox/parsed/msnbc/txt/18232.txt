         Let me know if you want me to say no. They know that your schedule is packed and this may
         not happen.

         Joey,



         Here are the rough stats I put together after talking

         to Bob Havemeister.



         -The avg. dairy farmer produces 60001b milk per day



         -6000lbs=706 gallons



         -Mat Maid pays farmers 21.08 per hundred weight



         -1,264.80 per day to farmers



         -that equates to 1.79 per gallon produced



         -461,652.00 per year to each farmer



         -2,308,260.00 paid to all farmers



         -Approx. 1,288,450 gallons produced yearly by the five

         dairies.



         -At a retail price of 4.79 gallon, equals 6,171,675.00

        per year gross



         -Since Alaskan milk only comprises about 28% of the

        Mat Maid product, multiply gallons of Alaskan milk by

         3.5 (imported milk) and you get 21,600,864.00 total

        gross    (of course this is using the 4.79 per gallon

        price and prices vary at different locations)



         -Mat Maids wholesale price to retailers in March was

        around 4.00 per gal. (I know it was 4.14 for convience
                                                        4

         stores, less at big stores). That price has probably

         gone up in the last few months.



         Conclusion: If Mat Maid were to go to a 100% Alaskan

         made product, wholesale it at 4.00 per gallon, the

         gross after paying the farmers would be 2,845,540.00.

         The question is, is that enough to sustain a small

         scale plant? If the wholesale price went up to 5.00

         per gallon, gross would go up to 4,133,990.00. We are

         only talking liquid milk here.



         Keep in mind that the dairies have their own problems.

         Some are debt free and others owe hundreds of

         thousands of dollars.



         ***Note ! These are not all official stats so don't

         publicly quote them. They 're based on some rough

         figures given to me.



         It will be interesting when you see their books.
