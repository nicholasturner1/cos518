             We're good now.  DHHS had already taken care of it. There was a mistake in Meyer's
             office.  Here was their response:



             Sherry,



             Interesting. We did receive it. I have a copy of it in my HB 337 binder. Thanks for
             following up on this. I think that there may have been some confusion with another
             Governor bill that we had not received a hearing request for.



             Thanks!

             Suzanne

            Russ- nopw Meyer's office is saying he's had no hearing request from the third floor on
            the bill. DOA and/ or others can whip that out of we truly haven't done that - pls let me
            know asap where we are on it.
