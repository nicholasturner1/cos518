          Yes- how about I stop by again tonight before getting on flt (we changed it from tomorrow
          be Anchorage schedule changed on us) and I'll check in the boxes at airport. I'm happy to
          take any of that food to wasilla/anch be i dont want the food to go to waste; I'll feed it
          to folks whom we're meeting with constantly on state business; it'll be a good time to
          clean out food storage so we can start anew when the family comes back.



          it is so good to be back and staying at the house last night was perfectly comfortable.
          Thank you!

          Good morning,

          Sorry I missed you this morning! Will you be coming back? We have boxes of freezer food
          if you'd like to take it home with you.

          Enjoy your day!

          Erika
