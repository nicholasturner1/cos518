        The State Emergency Management team is monitoring the situation on the Mat-Su HS. There
        has been no request from the community for state assistance at this time. I will update
        you if the state is requested to assist.

        Toured su valley hs fire - total loss so devastating. Tens of millions to replace. 200
        kids displaced in fall. Rep Neuman was right on it and was also there this morning. 8
        different fire depts responded from as far away as Chugiak.



        Our DPS comm people should have notified me - instead saw it on the news.



        Pls do presser saying "whatever it takes... Our kids' education needs will be met in the
        valley this fall"



        Also met with Sr Cnter volunteers feeding fire crews. Awesome people, thankful for the
        visit- red cross gave food. Valley community sure comes together during these tiimes.

             Governor,

            Just so you know Meg and I participated in a teleconference this afternoon with Tom Irwin and two of his staff that
            have spent a lot of time on Ag issues. At some point Tom disconnected and his staff continued to give their opinion
            of a sense of helplessness on the state's part and they drifted back to the language of "prudent" management that we
            discarded from an earlier release. I was nervous that we would be blamed for not doing enough to help the dairy
            producers and the employees so I called Irwin back at his house. We discussed the issue that we were requested to
            find 600,000 to help Mat-Maid put together a plan but now find out that they are closing. Tom, Meg and talked
            through the points in the release and all concurred. My first choice was to just let Mat-Maid respond but Meg said
            we had 6 press calls and we did not want the story to include that we did not return calls.

            Mike

            This falls within DNR and Div of Ag. We really need their input on this before responding.

             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
             07-144



             Governor Responds to Mat-Maid Closure




             June 7, 2007, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin responds to the
             Mat-Maid closure with the following statement today:



            " This is so very frustrating and shocking ," said Governor Sarah Palin.
            " Earlier this year, when we were informed of the financial challenges facing
            Mat-Maid, the Creamery Board asked the state for $600,000. We responded and
            fought hard to get the money with the help of the legislators. To now see a
            vote to shut down Mat-Maid without even knowing why we need to right now is
            perplexing. For quite awhile , the state has been asking for the business
            plans and economic models used to evaluate the future of Mat-Maid; we have
            yet to receive the information . The state still expects to see alternatives
            presented and reasons for the immediate shutdown."



            The Governor continued, "In the meantime, we are reviewing the situation and
            looking at what options might be available on behalf of the state to help
            the dairy producers and other Alaskans involved."
