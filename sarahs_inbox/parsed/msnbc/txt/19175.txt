         Quick clarification .  I did have Nizich already talk to Leo so yesterday was not the first
         discussion . I actually went over to see him about Privileged workload and current DOT
         structure . When he mentiond      j name I stressed o -fie needs to move asap . He will
         flying in this week and will addressing these issues as soon as he gets here ( which I
         believe is tues night or wed morning).

         Mike - the " To Do " list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it ' s time ( it's overdue) to move on.



         What process are you, as COS , using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
         hands ( I spoke with Emil about Privile a yesterday and you told me you ' ve already spoken with
         Leo about               I'll cc them in this note so they ' re prepared if they have to make
         the notifications ), should I contact them myself , or have you already contacted them?



         I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
         ended . If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
         overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal M^
        !Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



        Thanks
