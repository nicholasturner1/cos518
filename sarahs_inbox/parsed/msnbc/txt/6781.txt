        He's still in the press release. I just wasn't sure if he was going to be an honorary
        member.  It seemed we kept going back and forth on that one.

        Please note the changes in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Also I removed Todd as honorary
        member, but he can be added back if you guys want him there.




        Thanks,
