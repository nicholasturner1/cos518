              Due to ice? There's ice waiting for us in Bethel. And Juneau.

             This morning Rhonda emailed me the agenda ; I'll forward. Today I ' ll put together a
             briefing folder for you on info we've collected pertinent to the trip . I had it set up for
             you to depart from Wasilla but the aircraft section changed their mind due to conditions
             and ice. Gary?
