  Todd - Just a reminder that Senator Therriault's Family will be in JNU through Tuesday, 03.11.08. I let
  Heather Brakes who submitted the request know that the Governor and Family are not available this
  weekend but I would get back with her for maybe something on Monday, 03.10.08.

  I guess let me know if you would like a luncheon planned and if the Governor will also attend . Thanks,
  Janice
