         Dear Ms . Crome,



         We've been awaiting a reply from our previous email sent to your office last

         week.      Now that icicle has released to the press their intentions to sell

         their company, our organization needs to request that your office and the

         Governor take action to discuss our proposal at the earliest moment.



         We feel that any processing interest that might change hands might damage

         the possibility of recovering our property rights that were foreclosed on by

         the NPFMC.      This serious matter of the NPFMC not following National

         Standards (NS) is not up for discussion, as we've provided you with the

         information of NS #4 and how our rights as private contractors were not

         issued.



         We would appreciate your immediate attention to this email, and the

         discussion on how the Governor is going to proceed. I look forward to your

         correspondence tomorrow.




         Thank you for the consideration of an endorsement from the Governor on this

         most earnest effort to restore the rights of fishermen and communities in

         Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and beyond for Bering Sea/Aleutian island crab

         rationalization.
