               Subject: HB 4002 - Resource Rebate
               Governor.

               Both Co-Chairs of the C & RA committee, Rep. LeDoux and Rep. Fairclough and some members of House
               leadership, Rep. Olson, Rep. Chenault? want to amend the resource rebate bill as follows:

                 1. Add the $1,200 per person resource rebate payment as a separate line item on the PFD checks and check
                    stubs / 1099's (for people that get direct deposit)

                 2. Not have any supplemental application process for persons that did not qualify for a 2008 PFD. (This
                    removes an estimated 40,000 persons that our supplemental process in our bill are estimated to pick up).
                     This would save 40,000 x $1,200 in payments (over $40 million) and the $500,000 cost of Revenue to
                    running the new resource rebate program. These are persons in Alaska who don't qualify for a PFD
                    because they have not been here long enough, etc).

                 3. So that we do not miss veterans who receive VA benefits that are reduced by PFD payments so they do
                    not even apply for the PFD and would otherwise be left out in the cold by limiting the $1,200 to persons
                    getting PFD's, they would creates a new alternative payment program for just those veterans. The cost for
                    picking up the veterans alone is probably under $7 million.

               In my opinion, we cannot get the bill out of the committee without these amendments but will defer to Kelly on her
               measure of the committee.
