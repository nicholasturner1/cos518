           Subject: RE: Lyda




           First and most important, it's unheard of and absolutely unacceptable

           what Lyda has done to the supplemental budget--I think Con Bunde was the

           most candid when he said it was a bastardization of the process. Lyda

           touts the importance of tradition and following protocol--where is

           tradition and protocol now? I think this can be capitalized on.



           Attached is Lyda's newsletter w/ a list of Valley projects Lyda says you

           vetoed. Perhaps these are the groups she's speaking of re: you making

           promises to restore funding.

           AK State Fair, Palmer Arts Council, Alaska Family Services, Palmer water

           and sewer (fyi, Combs in town this week to meet w/ Tibbles so that could

           end up being the next "promise" you make), Mat-Su prison, etc.




                                                                       1




                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0013220

            Hew newsletter also says, "The Valley's priorities are Lyda's

            priorities."     One of her "priorities" is to construct "responsible

            fiscal policy and budgets," yet the legislative body she leads and

           manages has hijacked the supplemental budget-- this doesn 't sound like

            the way to develop responsible fiscal policy to me!



           Another of Lyda's "priorities"         are "safe communities and increased

            resources for law enforcement ," yet Senate DPS subcommittee cut more

            than $2 million and cut ALL new DPS positions. If it passes the Senate

           would be proposing not to fund a single new Trooper position. This is

           operating budget of course ,        and not a capital project that was vetoed,

           but the point is the same--she says one thing to the media but her

           actions reflect another.




           I have emails into other agency special assistants to get a list of

           specific, critical projects the subcommittees have removed under Lyda's

           watch.

           The only capital project I'm verbally, solidly committed to has been the

           Binkley/Menard Curry Ridge rd project- it's in the bond pkg.

           Subject: Lyda




           Harris just did a press conf where he repeated Lyda' s disingenous

           comments from last week re : my "promise to NOT veto projects"...

           supposedly I traveled the state , visiting vetoed projects , and according

           to Lyda I "got educated and promised not to veto the projects if they

           got back in the     ( supplemental ) budget ".   I totally disagree with Senate

           and House leaders repeating Lyda' s claim.



           When we asked, Lyda listed Valley Recycling project visit and -

           committment    ( yet I have not visited the center and did not know the gal

           Lyda said I promised ); Mat-Su Miners baseball field          ( Kris was with me- I

           threw out the first pitch , did not "tour " anything and made no promises

           of no veto ); and Lyda couldnt recall what other projects , but claims

           there must be many.



           Russ believed another project being touted as veto - proof, via my

           promise , came after touring the Anchorage port - again Kris was with me

           - no promise was made except to say I wanted to put it in a bond pkg so

           voters could confirm that project as a state priority.



           Can you think of anything else that she and Harris could be

           misconstruing as my "visits and promises to NOT veto "...          I know she's

           wrong but we must now spend valuable time proving her wrong .           Thanks.
