          Governor, we had a bad night in the Willow/Palmer area with at least 8-new lightening
          caused fires.   I wanted-to give you a heads up that you will be hearing from General
          Campbell that we have requested 3 helicopters from the National Guard , 2-to fight the
          fires with water buckets and 1-in reserve. You will have to approve the request. With
          the projected weather conditions we have requested additional lease helicopters from the
          lower 48 to supplement those in the state but that will take a little time. Also we have
          ordered the second type 2 team to be ready so we can respond quickly. There will now be a
          daily fire briefing at 11:00am at the Palmer airport. It would be a great place for you
          to visit.  Tomorrow would be the best for seeing dirty tired firefighters to thank them
          but your schedule is the priority.



           The Kenai fire grew significantly through the night but at this time the wind is blowing
          in a good direction. Tom



           It is sure good to have the high quality of firefighters in Alaska.                      Tom.

           You're a trooper Meg! I still can not believe you were on that CNN shoot. Go take a nap!
           Eric, too. Really , you're going to need massive energy for the big one coming up!



            Anyway -   Walt called , forest fire in Petersville is taxing our local guys - I may stop by
           our local   dept and thank the guys for all their efforts, Walt thought that's a good idea -
           we may be   bringing in Anchorage guys to help . KTUU was headed out there after their stop
           here this   morning.



            I won' t need assistance to do any stop-by, just wanted to let you know.
