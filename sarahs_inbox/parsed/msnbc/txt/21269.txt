              Hello Governor Palin,

              I wanted to let you know that everyone I know respects your stand on ethics, and I am a
              supporter of yours. I just wanted to let you know really appreciate that you stand on
              ethics instead of politics. I mostly vote Republican but I really vote for the personal
              stand of the politician. I support the President on the war but we need to secure our
              borders and deal with illegals, and I'm for an all Alaska gas line.

              One final thing I belive in equal rights for all Alaskans, rural preference won't work and
              I feel it's unconstituional.

              Scincerly

              Jim Ward
