           Pls sched one for my participation. I'll phone in. Pls wk w Kris on timing. Pls make sure
           we're getting state business announcements out to the public under my name as often as
           possible- let Sharon and Bill know the importance of this thanks. Also, when you hear my
           speeches on the road that reference AK and/or our energy issues it's appropriate to do
           pressers on that be we'd cover any other natl candidate's statements on AK-centric
           comments and references. Thanks
