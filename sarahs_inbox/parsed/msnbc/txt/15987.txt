         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor Palin,



         I just wanted to drop you a quick email and thank you for all you do for the great state
         of Alaska. I live a long way from your state here in Missouri. I mainly wanted to wish you
         luck in your policital future. Most of all, I do hope that Senator McCain will look in
         your direction when he selects his VP canidate; and if he does it is something you would
         consider.



         Best regards and may God bless you and your family,



         Rick Holman
