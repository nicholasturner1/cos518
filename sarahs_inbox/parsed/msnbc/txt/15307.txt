            MESSAGE:

            Governor,



            Congratulations on the birth of your new son and for having the courage and leadership to
            announce to the world that a child, especially a special child, is a gift from God. You
            are the kind of woman whose leadership I can believe in. Your priorities are in order and
            with them will surely come a blessed harmony in all you do.



            Godspeed and God Bless!




            MJ Wilson Emig
