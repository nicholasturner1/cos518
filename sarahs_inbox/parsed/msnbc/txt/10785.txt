              Governor - We just received word that the folks coming out of Washington, DC for the Polar
              Bear Briefing. will not be able to make it into ANC until Sunday evening. This meeting was
              scheduled for (tomorrow) Thursday, Jan. 3, 2008.  The new date/time for the Polar Bear
              Briefing is Monday, January 7 at 11:00 a.m. This has been updated on your calendar.
              Thanks, Janice
