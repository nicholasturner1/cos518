  Hi Beth,

  With the holiday weekend upon us, quite a number of our IT staff are on leave today. I will try
  to locate a co-worker who might be able to post his updated bio today, and if so, I will let you
  know. Thanks so much for bearing with us and for all your assistance with this project!

  Do we need to wait until all have been approved or can we get moving on this one?

  You should also have a new photo of Todd Palin.

  Hi Beth,

 I am expecting to have all the governors' spouses' bios finalized soon and then have them posted on our website.
 (I'll let you know when this happens.) Take care and thanks again for all your time and help. (Enjoy the holiday
 weekend!) Marcia
