              That is too far out . The sooner the better - all these other bills I'm asked to sign asap,
              it seems . Pls have it scheduled much earlier.

             Just emailed Mindy - - and will coordinate with her on the details .                  She's thinking that
             July might be a good time frame.



               Thanks,



               Rhonda

              We can do a " Celebrate Native Women " event when I sign the Nenana bridge bill - Mindy and
             I talked of an on-site signing and we can incorporate other aspects of Native women
             celebration at that time.
