              I just wanted to tell you that you did a good job with what was a difficult moment at the press
              conference. I recognized (in what you were saying) and know the feeling of making a decision
              that cuts off the wishes of people you respect because your job and the state's interest require
              it. That's a difficult part of leadership but you did what was right and I wanted to thank you for
              that. Never easy, eyes upward. You did well with a tough one.
