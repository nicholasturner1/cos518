                thanks! I'm sure it'll be great so if it's convenient an account there would be fine.

                thanks erika,

                 We don't have an account there, so rather then calling Admin. Services to request a check... I
                 talked to Janice and she'll put it on the office card. If you like Bullwinkles, let me know and I
                 can look into having an account set-up or maybe they'd give me a card for things like this.

                 Another thing- at 5pm we want to have pizza for ACES team. We were originally going to do
                 this at the house but they can't sneak away from the capitol during hearing... So can you order
                 four Large pizzas from somewhere good (I hear Bullwinkles is good but I haven't tried it) and
                 ask them to deliver to third floor capitol. If we don't have an account there, I have a state credit
                 card but don't know how we're supposed to pay for something like that. Thanks!
