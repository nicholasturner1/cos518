              Subject: Support Staff

              As we have three of our communications staff based in Juneau (Beth Leschper, Andy Mills, Jason
              Bluhm) and one press staff in Anchorage (Sharon Leighow) the clerical support staff position would
              work in Juneau - even if we hire additional staff in Anchorage.

              Much of the infrastructure that we deal with is based in Juneau . The support staffer would be
              responsible for:

                        communicating with a variety of State of Alaska departments and external audiences

                         helping "advance" events - details (how the event will happen, double-checking expectations,
                        location, audience, etc.)

                        managing flow of news releases and publications - proofing and managing distribution so we
                        don't send out releases with mistakes

                        distribution of hard copies of releases throughout Capitol (even when not in session)

                        researching and drafting correspondence for the communications office (we receive an average
                        of about 100 requests per month)

                  => proofing of correspondence from CR

                        maintaining calendars

                        managing press logs

                        creating/updating media directory

                        preparing news clips for distribution to Governor's staff

                        managing flag lists and notices

                        managing "special day" calendar so releases are sent out timely

                 => archiving documents as required by statute

                  = arranging and managing travel for four (possibly soon to be five)

                      assisting with communications activities and events (helping plan Town Halls or whatever else
                      comes up)

                      assisting with AN equipment

                      maintaining databases and lists

                      managing a huge amount of other day -to-day activities - such as answering the phone and
                      sorting mail , dealing with subscriptions, etc.
