           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palan,




           I am a special education teacher and I have worked with many students with Down's
           Syndrome.  They are truly special people who so easily capture ones heart. Two of the
           young men with whom I have worked and continue to visit at monthly "dinners out" have more
           personality and fortitude than anyone else I have known. I have always thought that being
           with them is as close as I will ever get to an angel here on earth. God bless you and all
           of your family.




          Warmest Regards,




          Leslie Ann Beaugez Ed.S


                                                                I
