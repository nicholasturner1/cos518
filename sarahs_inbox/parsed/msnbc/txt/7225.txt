        John_ when will agia bill be ready? I Iv for WGA conf early tomorrow am so dont know when
        i can sign it.



        Newsminer quoted you saying "no bill" yest was your fault, due to "vacation schedules"
        (like admin was on vacation?)... I was very surprised be I thot not having the bill was
        Lyda's and other legislator's fault, not the administration's. In fact I was repeating
        what i was told yest when speaking about the issue and even with reporters I suppose I
        sounded very inconsistent or ill-informed when claiming legislators didnt get it to us in
        time. Or i sounded like i was lying.



        I'm going into the Newsminer ed bd mtg this morning - i may be asked about it be it was a
        big deal to Stfen yest and he may try to trip me up on inconsistencies there.



        I was told Lyda was on vacation that's why it was late with signatures... And that's what
        I've repeated.  Should I correct your statement?
