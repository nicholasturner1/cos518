            Good news on the proposed federal rule that could devastate the Alaska cruise industry and
            many of the Alaska owned businesses that depend on it. If Secretary Chertoff decides to

            is on Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff's desk, and that it looks very good for Alaska.
            The staff recommendation to the secretary is exclude Alaska from the rule interpretation.
