           He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole out Energy Rebate
           $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking points, etc. So.... we need to take
           advantage of this a write a statement saying he's right on. (Glad he's flipflopping on
           OCS, too.)

           Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction" to some of Obama's
           good points this morning?

               Ladies and Gentlemen,,,

               Please consider the following reflections:

                1) Who are you serving and trying to help? - Families and our dwellings
                   OR Capitalists, Free Enterprise Investors, Free Markets ? OR the Oil Companies and their
               Refineries and distributors ?
               Do you remember what i told you about the
                "Fossil Fuel Distribution Network Distribution System"?? ( how they never get enough feed)
               and The Biggest Card they play is;
               a) its not me, its them others, over there
               b) JOBSFEAR, JOBS FEAR, JOBS FEAR (its the only emotion i ever see from them, and they
               really know how to "work it", jobs fear that is)

               2) Are all of you afraid to call the Refineries/Distributors to testify on future fuels stability

               of supply and pricing? and And how the distribution works ? Or how about a record of their
               users amounts and distinations .... Hmmmm
               Or, How will their refineries and the stations sell off affect Alaska? Hmmmmmm

               3) Mr. Hawker, How can you achieve:
               Efficiency, Equitable, Effective,,,( conservation ha ?, Alternative, and ?) these?
                Without testimony from the responsible parties of Refiners and distributors....Then, all you have
               is hear say !!!
               All of the "complex and complicated , now you see, me now you dont, testimony" from AEA,
               AIDEA, PCE, LIEHA, HESS, WEATHERIZATION, AND A WHOLE BUNCH MORE
               FEEDERS, (some CO-OPS ?), is foolish without original source data, accountability, and
                understanding.....

               4) You need to scrap the current programs and start a "Home owners energy bill of
               rights"with an annual energy allotment based on an electricity and water use formula per
               dwelling!


                  REMEMBER THIS IF NOTHING ELSE -
                   OUR ENERGY WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE US ALL A MORE FREE PERSON
               AND NEIGHBOR IN MY HOUSE WITH MY FAMILY;
               -- NOT MAKE ME A SLAVE TO INVESTMENT PORTFOLLIO PROFITS FOR THE
               LAZY, SWEATLESS, FEDERAL RESERVE, AND THOSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
               KILLING OUR CHILDREN!

                  5) Unleash the dogs and let them scent the trail to those who are raising the prices on our
               families "life essential energies needs"; --cut

               6) You need a new, fresh , and clean department with no addictions.
               Dedicated soley to the welfare of our Homes and family energy needs; And our Freedoms!
               Locate this department under the arm of the dept of justice.
               You need this Department right now!

              In closing,
                  This is a moment for all of you to be together as leaders and to shine with this task... ((((Just
              pass AGIA.. and lets get going without new future which we can do daily from now on .. Lets
              move on ... this stuff before you is more important than AGIA!
              AGIA is now in the hands of the World wide ENERGY Markets and all of those billions of
              people who are pissed off about being enslaved by energy manipulators.....))))))

                 This is a chance for you to be in history as a new society .... Those who tell you 10 years
              out to be a new society, well, part right, but... they are stuck in old ways and habits and narrow
              thinking, and fear of new dreams...

              You are being undermined, minimized, scapegoated and used as a conduit to deliver $$$$$to
              the fossil fuel distribution network, which will never get enough money from your families ... and
              loved ones....
              You will bankrupt us if you do not stop this extraction of our earned resource value money from
              us back to them few men who manage the Oil Companies!

                  HEY!; At the very least, for our money you are giving back to the producers, let us see

                (look up "EV world" and read their archive articles too )

               One billion dollars would buy 100,000 to 125,000 Electric Vehicles . If you screen out too
               old, dont drive, and option to buy , you could deliver a new electrical vehicle to nearly
               every dwelling in Alaska........Wake up tommorow and
               vwah-la, sha-zammm, kabamm, gift wrapped and ready to go.- lets talk....!

               100,000 EVs saving us 1,000 gallons of gas per year = 100,000,000 gallons of gas and oil, X
               $ 3.oo per gallon = $ 300,000,000.oo stays in the community of Alaska
               ( 65% to 85% of your energy bill money goes to energy owners and others, outside)
               Now, we move the the 100,000,000 gallons of gas back to oil and ship it out for sale and make
               money on that, and then we have service infrastructure needs for EV, Grants moneys,
               partnerships with All major auto dealers around the world..
               The Oil Procucers bring Hydrogen Refueling and Geothermal Plants to COnstruction, while we
               do 200 + small hydro electric plants and 25 major hydroelectric projects,,,,,
               and New research and development for Home Refueling plants for our homes and what do you
               have ????

               --A VERY WEALTHY NATION CALLED ALASKA ! WHOS CHILDREN WILL BE IN A
               LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE WORLD IN WATER BASED FUELS RESEARCH AND
               TECHNOLOGY AWARNESS;
               AND WITH THE PERMANENT FUND INVESTMENTS INTO OUR FORWARD
               UNDERSTANDING OF WATER AND ELECTRICITY HARMONIC FUELS MATERIALS
               AND APPLICATIONS. WE WILL INVEST WISELY AND REAP LARGE REWARDS...

               MANY CLEAN INDUSTRIES WILL WANT TO LOCATE HERE DUE TO OUR
               "VAST CLEAN ENERGY "SWITCH ON " CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES" IN READY
               AND RESERVE..

               This is just the tip of what waits for you now and in the future...And you can start today by just
               calling in the producers and telling them... Enough is Enough; We are Done! Here is how it is
               going to be and how it is going to happen....!

               Your going to role back all local refined fuels prices to this date and amount _?
                    Any additional moneys you think you are owed you can submit to a special fund of review
               for readjustment at a later date!
                   All and each of you are going to commit our gas to the AGIA process or leave!
               And, we are all headed for a new society and we want a full array of new technology products
               constructed now, beginning with:

               Oh, and by the way,, It is difficult to end in such a way,,,
                  Surely, you realize the oil companines cannot -impact an economy unless they have
               something to impact with; like say a work force of several hundred or thousand-
                  It is my opinion the Oil Companies are going to smack down the Alaskan Economy!
               Because I am not privy to the inside events and the outside reconstructing of markets i cannot
               forcast exactly when, but I do smell it in the air by the things they are not doing....
               By Alaska having our ENERGY VISION IN PLACE NOW, THE IMPACT SHOULD BE
               MINIMISED; EVEN PERHAPS AVOIDED AND TURNED TO A VERY SPECIAL PLACE..

              AEA NEEDS TO BE RESTRUCTURED AND SUBDIVIDED INTO A SPCECIFIC AREA
              OF OBSERVABLE EXSPECTATIONS, ACTIONS, PRODUCTIONS AND
              RESULTS ACHIEVMENTS.
