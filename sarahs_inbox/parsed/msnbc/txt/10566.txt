              Governor - I spoke to them earlier and told them that it was unlikely that you would be
              able to attend. I have tried to call the office and no one is answering. I am under the
              impression that it is 7-8 miles from Palmer on the Old Glenn Highway. Janice

             Old glenn can be accessed by going thru Palmer (like you were on your way to cemetary or
             Butte - I think the road is Arctic thru Palmer) or it can be accessed by taking the Old
             Glenn exit off the flats.

              Governor - just spoke to them. Go out Old Glen - Go 7-8 miles and you will come to Yellow
              Blinking Lt. turn Right - continue approx. 3-4 miles and you will come to Spur Rd . - small
              sign probably covered in snow - there is a gate there . Let me know and I can call you to
              walk you through also.  Janice
