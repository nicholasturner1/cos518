                Governor,

                I talked to Karleen and she is going to send you an update on potential cases as well as a description of
                changes/improvements being made at OCS . She will send the information tomorrow. I hope that is soon
                enough . She did not expect anything to be out in tomorrow 's news.

                Mike
