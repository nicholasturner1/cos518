          I think she sounded awesome and I' m anxious for her to see Juneau to see if she'd still
          like to be a part of this- I think she'd need to be in Juneau for participation in some of
          the session . She seemed great!

          Also, we're only going to give Graham the mask. We'll save the book for someone else. Too
