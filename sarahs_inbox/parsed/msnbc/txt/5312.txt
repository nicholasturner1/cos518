                  Governor,

                 Some additional information. The AGIA bill gives the Commissioners the discretion to set the
                 time for response to the RFA. However, the AGIA timeline the gasline team agreed to, in order
                 to have a 2008 field season , only allows 3 months for response to the RFP. And this is the
                 information that we've been providing here in Washington DC. Furthermore , in our discussions
                 with potential project applicants, they have supported 3 months as an adequate timeframe.

                 Marty R
