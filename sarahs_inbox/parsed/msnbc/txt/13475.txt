           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on the birth of your son.    I am 38 now but when I was going to middle
           shcool (Mears Junior High here in Anchorage), my dad used to teach children experiencing
           downs syndrom how to swim. Since I was on the swim team, I would go with him and help.
           Everyone was so nice , thoughtful and loving.   it was the best group of human beings I have
           ever been around.  They had christ-spirit.    My dad called them little "little buddhas".
           Enjoy your angel.  And best wishes, Bobi
