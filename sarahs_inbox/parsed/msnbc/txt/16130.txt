          Governor - I received a call from ConocoPhillips - Jim Bowles office in ANC. Jim Mulva
          will be arriving ANC today, Monday afternoon and would like to stop in to see you for
          approx. 30 minutes. I asked the subject matter and it is more a greet as he has not seen
          the you in awhile and will be in town. Mr. Bowles will also be accompanying him. Joe is
          aware of the meeting and said he is also available to staff you.

          Tuesday before the 2:30 p.m. Wall Street Journal Interview.
