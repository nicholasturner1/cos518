             Governor:

             I know a Cabinet meeting is scheduled for May 1 - the National Day of Prayer.
             Traditionally an observance has been at noon on the Capitol steps. In Wasilla, from the
             NDP website is the following:

             National Day of Prayer Additional Information: Location: Wasilla City Hall Flagpole

              Herning

              Wasilla, AK 99654 Start Date & Time: 05/01/2008 12:00 PM End Date & Time: 05/01/2008
             01:00 PM Coordinator: Laurie Kari

               (907)376-7301

             directions



             I just didn't know if you were aware that the Cabinet meeting is scheduled to conflict
             with this.  I don't have any confirmation about an observance on the Capitol steps this
             year or ANC information.
