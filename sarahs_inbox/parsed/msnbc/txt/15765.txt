         Governor - People Magazine is sending up photographer, make-up artist for pictures and
         would like to come out to your home in Wasilla. They would like to include the family in
         the photo shoot. They will need to travel up and so would like us to be able to give them
         a date. They were looking at June 13 but you may be in Fairbanks on that date. They are
         willing to come up and do this on a weekend even. Thanks, Janice
