         Subject:                  Call from Curt Menard


         Governor - I just called Curt Menard and asked if there was something that I could help
         him with as you were in bill signings. Mr. Menard wanted to ask you if you'd reconsider
         for this Sunday with the Ntl. Park Svc. Tour as the Lama Helicopter was going away after
         July 15.




         I explained that     we can not reconsider at this time. Mr. Menard asked that we not forget
         about them and I     told him we would try for sometime in August. He is asking if you're
         open to the idea     of using a National Guard Helicopter as it would be a "training mission"
         for those folks.     Thank you, Janice
