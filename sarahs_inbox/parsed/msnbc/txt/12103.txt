             I don 't know the specifics of that - but we're concerned about any changes to kabata's RFP
             that would put the state at greater risk- wait to comment on it until I grab randy though.

             Governor-



             Kyle Hopkins is asking for the administration's view on the bills

             introduced (Ellis and Gara) calling for a 60 day public comment period.

             Shall I have Randy call him or would you like to address this?

             Issues are arising. If asked about them I will candidly tell reporters I

             have serious concerns about anything being approved that is not in the

             state 's best interest... I'm happy to talk to reporters about the

             issues .    Lawmakers are addressing kabata complaints this week too.
