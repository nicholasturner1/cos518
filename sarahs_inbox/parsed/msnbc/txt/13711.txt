              She has Tuckerman all over this with him sending messages that this issue is somehow OUR
              fault- that people should be questioning the Gov on this- and that Lyda did nothing to
              stand in the way. His accusatory messages to others are unbelieveable, yet par for the
              course considering his mother-in-law has not had to be held accountable for anything thus
              far.

             Obviously an attempt to drive a wedge between us and the Senate Democrats as we discuss
             AGIA.  Perfect scenario for Lyda as a cover for her failure. She and Charlie can not get
             away with putting the failure of their organization on us. We should ask her if she is
             willing to pull a bill from committee or overrule her Democrats (actions that she has
             refused to do) to ensure something gets done - next year.

             Lyda Green just announced on Fagan's show that she will send a letter to the Governor
             urging her to expand the call of the special session to include the partial birth
             abortion/parental consent bill.  FYI
