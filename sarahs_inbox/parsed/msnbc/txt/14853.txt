          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,  Congratulations on the birth of your precious baby! You are truly
          blessed!  I will tell you from my. own experience of a Mom of a special child, you have an
          adventure of a lifetime ahead of you. Before my Mary was born, I used to think the
          hardest thing in the world would be to have a special needs child--but not so! There is a
          whole other world that will open for you, and you will find such joy you cannot imagine in
          your son. I will be praying for you and your family. Take care, Barbara Tousley
