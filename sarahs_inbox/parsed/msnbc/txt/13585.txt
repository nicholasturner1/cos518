                Flooding yes, but the emphasis seemed to be on taxes. I'll check on it though. As a side note, this was also
                sent on Friday - to Beth Leschper - and I was just cc'd.

                Thank You!

               What happens is that folks out here get weary of Government That is a given. But when it is Government for
               Government, they get real weary. The little guy who really needs it in times of distress gets nothing, only
               comments like "private sector can fend for itself'. That doesn't leave a real good impression on common hard
               working folks that pay their taxes and try to conform to all the rules, regulations and hassles that Govt imposes.

                 Governor Palin,
                 The next time we have a major breakup on the Kenai River that damages everything on the river, it
                 would be much more appreciated it

                 Instead of flying down the river in an expensive heli ride surveying the damage and filling the coffers of
                 local government to help them fix the public damage , and announcing that the private sector can suck
                 it up and eat hay, I suggest a little more compassion for us. We had thousands of dollars in damage
                 that you can 't buy insurance for even if you wanted to. We have no way to be reimbursed . Instead, we
                 get huge reappraisals of land values that increase our property taxes double.
                 It cost me alone over 25, 000.00 to fix our situation and no help from anyone.

                 I don't think it is fair. The Govt has an unending supply of monies and can easily raise taxes and do so
                 I might add to fill any gaps . Then, as a senior citizen they take away half our exemption on property
                 taxes.
                 Our kids all went to Cook Inlet Academy and cost no one anything . We are now sending our grand
                 children there too as the public schools are filled with dope , sex, and bad things . But we still pay out
                 the nose for taxes.

                 I really think it is unfair to overlook the Kenai property owner and tell them they can fend for
                 themselves.

                  Even this year we had major damage again , though not as bad as last year.

                 You were really unfair and short sighted to give millions to local govt and short us the ones who really
                 needed it.

                 Sincerely
                 Ralph Meloon
