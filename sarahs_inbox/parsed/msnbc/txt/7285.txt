              Dear Kevin Banks

             We appreciate all that you can do to encourage new oil and gas companies to invest thier risk Capital in
             drilling wildcat wells in Alaska. Rick Wagner and I will be at the GO-EXPO in Calgary on the 12 thru the
             14 and I was interested to find out from you if you or someone from your Staff plans to be at this oil and
             gas Conference and if so please let us know so we can get oil and gas companies interested in Alaska to
             meet you. I offer my help to your office in anyway that may help the DNR DOG's effort to bring new oil
             and gas companies to Alaska.

             Please let Commissioner Erwin know that I appreciate your efforts and encourage him to send someone
             like you to Calgary for this very large oil and gas convention. I will be with Rick Wagner from Fairbanks
             and we would love to meet you for Lunch or Dinner if you come and if you have the time we would like to
             discuss ideas how we can help your office in this shared interest . I wish you and all your staff the best
             luck in turning Alaska into the greatest oil producer in North American . Please respond kindly to my
             invitation. I will be reachable on my cell phone number below or by e-mail. Here is the link just in case;
