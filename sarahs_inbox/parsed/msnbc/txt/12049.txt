           Governor - I had emailed Erika on this request this weekend. Erika was hoping that they
           would be able to do this today. Janice

           Would you have a computer installed in Todd's office at the house? Don't know if the
           murkowski's got work done with only one computer between their two offices, but we're busy
           enough where both offices need their on computers so we're not trying to share one desk
           top. Thanks

               There's a computer in Todd's office, so when Janice requested another- I assumed that you wanted one in the office/room by
               the kitchenette.
               There's currently a request for one to be installed in your old office. Do you want one in what used to be your office or the
               2nd floor Family room?

               Thanks,
               Erika
