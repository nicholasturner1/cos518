         I need the speech as soon as possible this morning, hopefully in near-final form. I want
         AGIA communications folks to edit it and to make sure our message is consistent,
         energetic , and meshes with the iogcc participants' agenda. Thanks



         If it's not complete , pls send it to me anyway be I want to hustle on this
