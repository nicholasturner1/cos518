            Governor - good news: the Alaska Grown Logo lawsuit appears to be over. The membership
            voted to accept the state's proposal. Still need signatures on the agreement but 99%
            there.  We won in court awhile back but there was interest by some to bring this to the Ak
            supreme court.  Steve Ross (LAW), Craig Tillery (LaW), Dick Lefebvre (DNR) and Franci H
            (DNR)  carried the load with great support from others. Major results: the state has full
            rights to the logo, the Mat Su chapter has a new President that wants to work with us to
            move AG forward, reasonable costs were shared by the groups, and the Mat Su chapter can
            again sell Ak Grown materials.   We stood up for what was right, won, and still worked out
            a way forward.    I am really pleased. God bless. Tom
