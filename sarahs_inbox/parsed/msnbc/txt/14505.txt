           Governor - Commissioner Galvin just called and asked if you had 15 minutes today that he
           could meet with you. He said 11:00 a.m. would work for him but anytime you have available
           he will make himself available. He needs to talk with you in regards to AIDEA Director.
           Thank you, Janice
