Todd, the House alarm system is working like it's suppose to. They did a few tests just to make sure.
Thanks, Erika

Todd,



I received a phone call from our Facilities Mngr. this morning.



                                                    1                              ROSTON 01911

The alarm communications service, Securitas, that contacts the fire and police departments is not
working. The red box downstairs tests the system-if it goes off you can call me or re-set it. The main
alarms will work, but we would need to contact the fire/police dept. directly if there was an
emergency.



They will keep me updated . Call if you want more information or have any questions. This is also
affecting other state office bldgs.



Thanks,

Erika
