                 I'm sorry I wasn't aware of the summit that was held In
                 Dillingham . I am assuming that villages with concerns such as
                 South Naknek with its current energy crisis should go through
                 BBNC to ensure we speak with a collective voice to address
                 our current crisis. If so, are you the contact person?

                 If.this is the case, South Naknek Village Council communicated
                 to governor Palin in late June and early July that her $1200.00
                 proposal does not come close to helping anyone in village
                 Alaska nor does dropping the taxes at the gas pump. We have
                 calculated for South Naknek, the current cost for heating, fuel,
                 electricity, water & sewer and gasoline will cost each
                 household approximately $18000 to $20000 for the coming
                 year. This high cost for energy does not address all other
                 annual vital needs such as food, etc.

                 Our current heating fuel cost is $6.50 per gallon , we are not
                 sure what the Increase will be when our fall fuel barge arrives.
                 I'm sure an additional $1 will be added . Electricity water and
                 sewer are attached to high fuel cost . Gasoline is near $8 and
                 rising. There is no doubt fuel cost in the upriver, lake area and
                 the Peninsula villages will experience even higher costs.

                 This crisis is immediate and if not addressed before mid Sept. (when
                 the fuel barges stop running), the costs will even be higher, that is if
                 anyone could afford it. There is not a family here that can afford the
                 current prices. So between now and the end of August what are the
                 plans? I do not see anything concrete that would help our immediate
                 needs.

                 All of the other items discussed are important and needed, however
                 more long term In nature and should be pursued regardless. Our
                 immediate concern is the here and the now . Families are worried
                 about where to find the money for the next 50 gallons of heating fuel
                 and where do they find the next 5 gallons of gas to pick their net.
                 This issue alone is where the state needs hard hitting now. Unless
                 the state addresses the current crisis regarding high energy costs,
                 all of the other Items discussed at the summit will not matter.
                 Village people will be forced from their villages come Sept. If the
                 state does not step forward and help now. Out migration has been
                 accelerated the past couple of years with the high cost of living
                 and villagers are now getting desperate.

                 Fish base prices are 12 cents per pound less than last year. Bay
                 Watch paid their fishermen off with 50 cents a pound , and they are
                 generally the highest paying processor in the Naknek River.
                 Since BBNC has taken the lead role to address the energy crisis I am
                 hoping my statements can be included and pursued along with
                 everyone else's. I'm not sure if other villages are aware of BBNC's
                 lead roll on these issues. Have they been contacted? Has there
                 been discussions with the Governor or Staff ? The Governor needs to
                 get on board immediately, as does Bryce about our immediate
                 energy crisis. There is no time to waste . Everyday counts. Please
                 keep me informed . Thank you very much for your efforts.
