             Pls waive it and give to FBI- I say we should err on the side of giving them more, not
             less, info. Did the fishermen ask me to do anything in that letter last year besides have
             Law look into it? And was the response from me or Dept of Law?

              complaint




            Dear Governor Palin,

                   The FBI has subpoenaed records from the Dept . of Fish and Game regarding earmarks
             from Sen. Ted Stevens that ended up going to projects favored by the Kenai River Sport
             Fishing Association.

                    Last year ( Sept . 14, 2007 ) the Kenai Area Fishermen ' s Coalition ( KAFC ) sent you a
             letter complaining about the allocation of Stevens earmark money to the Kenai River Sport
             Fishing Assn . projects.    The Dept . of Law was asked to investigate and we did .     My staff
             issued a 7 page memo on October 12, 2007 outlining events and process and concluded with
             "The allegations in KAFC ' s letter do not appear to constitute any violations of state
             legal standards.   We believe no further investigation is warranted."
