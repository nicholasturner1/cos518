            Governor - We received the request this week. They would like a short statement from the
            Governor stating how proud Alaska is of their relationship with the military, etc. This
            statement will be used in the live feed during the national broadcast to the US.



            We went ahead to prepare PSA if you choose to do this. It will take place tomorrow,
            Friday, 06.20.08 in JNU at 10:15 a.m. (following the AGIA Taped Briefing). Thanks, Janice

           Governor,




           Here is the script for your PSA. Janice will print it out for you, and Jason and Andy will
           load it into the teleprompters. Please let me know if you'd like me to make any changes.
           Thank you!
