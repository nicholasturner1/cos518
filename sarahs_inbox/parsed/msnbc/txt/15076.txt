            The empire has never really been a friend of the administration. They like attacking all
            the time. If there is nothing to gripe about give them a minute or two and they will think
            of something. I think when you are here for SS you need to set up a meeting with them....

           If we make a big stink with either he or his editors, we only make it worse. We do need to
           develop some long-term strategies at improving our relationship with him - to do whatever
           we can. I'd be happy to spend time with him when we're in Juneau. Not sure if the issue is
           he has an ax to grind or he's incompetent.

            Mal claims Forgey's story left out a lot of what he said to him. How do we deal with this
            guy and a newspaper editor that seems more than content to let poorly written and
            investigated stories be printed?

            Leo & Frank,



            For the record , today's Juneau Empire reported only half of what I said . What I said was,
            The permit is in its final stages. When received we will go to the commissioner with the
            permit and the project status and ask for direction . We do have the first segment ready to
            bid. He asked if that was a 23 mile segment and I said a 5 mile segment . He asked if it
            was to "draw" the expected law suit and I replied it could be.



            None of what he asked Reuben or I on costs, either roads or ferries, was used.
