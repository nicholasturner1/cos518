           Goodness, I'm at a loss here - can't believe he'd want to mention in a story anything like
           this. I say, politely to questions like this, ummmmm, isn't enough enough? We don't want
           to exploit this - and I'm sure they have other things to write about. Is it any wonder I
           waited 7 mos to say anything? :)   I've always liked your response to reporters about
           family being an off-subject, but don't know how we'll get around these questions. Wish
           they just wouldn't ask.

           Governor-



           Pat from the Empire would like to know about baby gifts. He wants to know if you expect a
           lot and what would you do if you have a bunch of extras. If you were thinking of donating
           or didn't want to be inundated with stuff I could tell him - The Governor appreciates all
           of the well wishes she has received so far and encourages folks to donate to XXX or XXX.



           Thoughts?
