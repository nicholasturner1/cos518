               Mike,

               At the AML meeting, Mayor Williams of Ketchikan stood up and asked whether a deal would
               be completed between the state and Ketchikan to keep the Marine Highway System hq in
               Ketchikan. I told him that you were a better one to answer that question than I as I have not
               been involved in discussions over the issue. Can you please call him and talk with him about
               the issue. Thank you.

               Sean
