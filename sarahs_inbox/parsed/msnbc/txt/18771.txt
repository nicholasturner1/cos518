             I am forwarding an email from Barbara Thompson that summarized Glenn 's requests to the state . You asked me to
             give Glenn a call and I am happy to but I wanted to ask you if I could talk to you tomorrow when I am up there first.
             The Board meeting is Friday where his group will be able to offer testimony and request the board discuss the issues
             below at their work session. Also, he will ask me to commit to making these changes. I know you responded that you
             are with him philosophically but he will push for me to commit to specific proposals. One is a significant policy
             question that is much more than an equity issue (I can tell you that Carol Comeau is concerned and will be attending
             the Friday board meeting to listen to Glenn) and another is a significant legal issue that would require the Department
             of Law to reverse a previous opinion. Anyway, I am concerned that in my effort to discuss his issues , he will be quick
             to go to the Board on Friday and testify that he has the Governor's full support for these proposals.

             I would be happy to call him as I committed but would you be OK if I talked to you tomorrow first?

             Mike

             Subject: Beigel Points

             The two major items that Mr. Biegel and the Alaska Home Educators Alliance (AHEA) would like changed
             appear to be:

               1. Remove the 15% cap on expenditures for music, fine arts and physical education. Currently, 4 AAC
                   33.421(m) places a limit for expenditures for music, fine arts, and physical education at 15% of the
                   Base Student Allocation (which is currently $5,380). (15% of the BSA equals $807). Since most
                   statewide correspondence programs offer program "fund allotments" of @ $2,000 per student, up to
                   $807 of that allotment could be spend on music, fine arts, and/or physical education.
               2. Allow parents to use privately purchased religious materials/curriculum for their child's instruction.
                   Currently, parents may purchase religious materials (or any other materials they choose) to supplement
                   materials approved and purchased by the school district's Statewide Correspondence Program. The
                   2005 Attorney General's Opinion speaks to the use of religious materials and Mr. Biegel/AHEA
                   believe this opinion is in error.
            I have heard that when Mr. Biegel spoke on the radio last week that he said that all they (AHEA) want is to
            get a hearing with the State Board. Mr. Biegel and homeschooling parents and students provided public
            comment at the Board's June meeting and will again have the opportunity to provided comment, written and
            oral, at the Board meeting on September 21 st, as well as anytime in the future.

            If you need or want more information, let me know! Thanks, Lynne. BAT

            Sorry, I got tied up, and didn't see others' efforts - I edited substantially from the original, and including some
            major rewites and major deletions (comments on some points included).
