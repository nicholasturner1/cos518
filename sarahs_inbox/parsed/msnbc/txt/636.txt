Good morning Governor,



I received the request to develop this information last Thursday and I thought I did relay that it would
take a bit of time to gather as we needed to find and retrieve old records. We do have the records
now and have been compiling the information. We should be able to complete last and largest
largest piece, Governor and Mrs. Murkowski's travel info, today. I'm hoping to email a spreadsheet
with the various comparisons to you and the other folks later this afternoon.



I'm sorry this is taking a while to get to you.

Linda

Subject: Anchorage office



How close are we to having the numbers showing #of days former Gov(s) spent out of Juneau
compared to my travels/housing expenses? The public deserves clarity on this as the misperception
is I'm "living and working" in the Valley. If, as Security and administrators tell me, Murk and Knowles
also worked out of the Anchorage office and spent many, many days out of Juneau - then the fair
comparison needs to be made and presented. The other missing point in the coverage of this issue is
that the Anchorage office is the workplace.



When I requested this info a couple of weeks ago I wasn 't sure who was heading it up - please let me
