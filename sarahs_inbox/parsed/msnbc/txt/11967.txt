           Governor,

                As a citizen interested in having a trusted strong leader in Washington D.C., I ask
          that you to except the offer as the republican vice Presidential candidate when it is
          offered in the coming months.



                   The leadership you have shown in Alaska is badly needed in Washington D.C.

          Thanks

          Mike Boggess
