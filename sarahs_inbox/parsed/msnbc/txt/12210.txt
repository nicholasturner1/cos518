             You can't get anymore awesome, I read your Alaska magazine article! When we got home from
             anc last night I read aloud to the aunt and uncle "the irony w andrew is, I am the same
             person w the same positions I had when he wanted to work w me in the
             administration ...there is certainly bitterness now, but I hope for his sake that he can
             find something to be happy about." Goes w/out saying, you got a standing ovation in this
             house!



             Went and saw kris earlier in the day. She's looking good-and rested. Was great to visit w
             her.  Read that todd rode 400 miles w a broken arm-just amazing! Tell 'em we are all so
             proud of him.



             Incorporated into a draft speech what newt said: good conservatives must declare their
             independence from the r party and start looking introspectively or R's will continue to
             fail. Touching base w frank today to incorporate/edit the draft we have. Man, you really
             are the PERFECT person to deliver such a msg!
