          Dear Bill,    Samon, and Teedah,



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently , and cut wasteful spending.




          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

          We thank you for the following budget decisions:



          1. Alaska Berry Growers (Jack and Debbie Brown)Proposed $ 100,000 now ZERO.




          2. Sterling Community (Contractors) Club Proposed $ 300,000 now ZERO.



          3.   Sterling Seniors Proposed $ 300,000 now $ 75,000.



         Because of the inflation spiral, we are in the process of placing a large used double wide
         ATCO Structure on our property next door in cherry condition 28'x 60 ,' for a mini motel
         bed type facility to enhance our generally fixed income in the late spring, summer and
         early fall. We demolished the old cabin house that was falling down.



         We did not and we repeat we did not go to any form of government for any type of funding.
         Most of our cost is out of our savings and a very small loan on our property at Key bank.
         We expect to house 12-14 people at the maximum.




         Samon works for a fish processor; long hours and lots of expensive gasoline. Next year
         (2008) we'll be online about the middle of May trying to pickup the professional fishing
         guides overflow basically and some of our own overnighters. At the maximum Samon will see
         about 8 hours of work per day with help as she requires it. We'll drop our fuel use
         radically to about 6,000 miles per year for 2-cars, instead of 12,000 miles per year. We
         close the business down after fishing season to start a new the next spring.



         We plan to name it either "Teedah's Mini-Motel" or "Teedah's Retreat." One of the rooms
         will have "GUV's DIGGS" on the door, just incase you and your family require a very
         friendly place to stay, incognito outside of the "city" life.



         Love from Bill,     Samon and Teedah
