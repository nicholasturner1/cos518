            FB- would u call Stoltze and tell him "we" didn't make this cut.



           Do u think they'd have cut a sport fish weir in the city of Juneau? No.

            little bit.

            Mike - why'd the fish gate         ($ 55g) get cut out of fish and game budget ? Out of a $10m budget
            this isn't a good cut.
