              MESSAGE:

              Dear Governor Palin,




              Congratulations for your tough stand on ethics and accountibility in government. Not only
              does Alaska need your refreshing, no-nonsense governing style, but the whole country could
              do with a big dose of your leadership format. Very happy to read about someone who is
              definitely not part of the "Good Old Boys" club. I surely hope you continue to do a
              wonderful job in Alaska. Perhaps you might have a little energy left when your term is
              done; we surely could use you down here in New Jersey. Good Luck, and God bless.

              John T. Bentley, a budding fan.
