          I've asked Randy to look into the preliminary work that's been done on a road to connect
          Alaskans with their resources in the rich area of Nome. No major access.road has been
          built in Alaska since the 70's, we're in a time of surplus where we should be building up
          infrastructure in areas people want roads and access for development, and we need to build
          access to further diversify our resource development base... so heads up that Randy will
          be contacting you who are needed to provide him info on this as we think big and
          proactively work towards enabling development for AK's future. Thanks!

               Thank you, Mike, for that introduction, & good morning@ To the
               congressional candidates who are with us today - welcome. We so
      I        appreciate your interest & pro-active investigation into AK's resources. We,
               your northernmost neighbors, have not only watchedfuel & energy prices
               as they soar to astronomical highs , we havefelt it. Many in AK face the
               choice between heating their home & putting food on their table, A I know
               that - regrettably - some Americans in the Lower 48 are experiencing the
               same challenges.

               The price of oil, & now, gasoline, has become sensitive & subject to events
               occurring outside the United States . We have placed ourselves in a

               position of having to plead with suppliers in theMiddle East to increase
               production when, instead , we. could lift the development bans that are keeping
               us from our own resource independence.

               The endless debate over energy prices is especially frustrating to AKns, b/c we
               know that we are ready to be part of the solution. On your tour, you've seen
               evidence that AK truly is a resource-rich state, with huge deposits of oil & natural
               gas, & we hope that you will agree that these resources should be developed to
               benefit the rest of the nation. Opening up just that sliver of ANWR could produce
               enough oil - an estimated one million barrels per day - to ease the fuel crisis &
               reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This could be accomplished through
               sound science & a tiny footprint in that vast wilderness of nearly 20 million acres.

               I have joined Pres. Bush in calling on Congress to open ANWR, & I appreciate
               that our president recognizes this is the right course of action. I applaud the
               president in lifting the ban on drilling in federal offshore areas. AK's offshore
               federal lands in the Beaufort & Chuckchi Seas alone contain an estimated 25
               billion barrels of oil & 100 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. But that's not-enough.
               That's where you can help, b/c we need Congress' approval to move forward.

               And where natural gas is concerned, AKns are finally seeing progress in
               developing that resource after three decades of effort. Thanks to recent
               legislation - our Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, or AGIA - which provides the
               private sector with the necessary incentive to compete, our gas pipeline is ready
               to move from a hope to a reality. As competition increases desire to produce, we
               eagerly look forward to being a help to the rest of the nation in this time of
               energy crisis.

              Over the last few days you've seen firsthand the safety measures & sound
              science that would not only lay the foundation for AK's economic future, but also
              lead the way toward lessening America's dependence on foreign oil. I believe it
              is imperative that we protect the security & economic freedom of Americans by
              responsibly developing our known resources. Well, I know we're all eager to

                        NCOIL TARGETS HEALTH REFORM AT SUMMER MEETING-SUPPORTS
                                 EXTENDING YOUNG ADULT HEALTH BENEFITS

              New York. NY. July 15, 2008 - As part of an ongoing effort to increase health insurance access and
              affordability for the uninsured and underinsured, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators
              (NCOIL) adopted on July 13 a Resolution in Support of Extending Dependent Health Benefits for Young
              Adults. Lawmakers acted during the July 10 through July 13 NCOIL Summer Meeting here.

              According to Rep. Susan Westrom (KY), Committee co-chair and sponsor of the resolution said,

                       It is hard for young adults to obtain health insurance-they move in and out ofjobs more
                       frequently and are more likely to be employed in positions where benefits are not
                       available. While extending benefits to young adults is not a panacea to the many access
                       problems facing our health insurance system, it allows them to obtain coverage that
                       would otherwise be unavailable or unaffordable.

              The resolution recognizes state efforts to provide additional health insurance benefits for young adults. It
              supports the extension of existing dependent health insurance benefits to individuals up to age 25,
              regardless of student status, and encourages states to enact legislation presenting master policy holders
              with an option to purchase such extended benefits for young individuals.

               At least 20 states have passed similar legislation in recent years, including Colorado, Connecticut , Florida, Idaho,
               Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky , Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire,
               New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington.

               Studies indicate that 30 percent of young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are at risk of being uninsured.
               Most young adults lose dependent health insurance coverage under their parent's or guardian ' s policy at the age
               of 19, or when they graduate from college . While most parents cover their children or dependents through their
               employer, nearly 60 percent of these health plans do not cover young adults beyond 19 who are not enrolled in
               college.

               The NCOIL Health, Long-Term Care & Health Retirement Issues Committee adopted the resolution by a large
               margin on July 11, followed by unanimous adoption by the Executive Committee on July 13. The resolution was
               amended during the July 11 Health Committee meeting to reflect 2008 state activity and to address cost-related
               issues.

               The resolution is part of an active NCOIL effort to develop effective approaches to health insurance concerns,
               such as access, affordability, and transparency. On July 12, NCOIL sought to find such answers in a symposium
               entitled State Health Innovations: What Works? What Doesn 't? Panel participants explored the major reform
               barriers and discussed the impacts of state initiatives , including individual mandates, employer pay-or-play
               provisions, high-risk pools and advancements in health information technology.

               At a July 13 roundtable discussion, legislators affirmed a continued commitment to health insurance reform in
               areas not inhibited by federal preemptive measures such as ERISA , and spoke of forming a task force dedicated to
               review data, examine impacts and pursue new innovations.

               The NCOIL Summer Meeting was held from July 10 through July 13 at the Marriot Marquis in New York City.

               NCOIL is an organization of state legislators whose public policy concern is insurance legislation and regulation.
               Most legislators active in NCOIL either chair or are members of the committees responsible for insurance
               legislation in their respective state houses across the country.

              Tom, Congratulations on the new energy plan just rolled out! It is finally time to see gas development open up in
              Cook inlet, this plan will be remembered as the keystone in Public/Private ventures in our State. To me, there is
              nothing better for the Public Interest than the State investing to make these kind of ventures successful. Reasonable
              returns for resource development for more parties ( Producers, State, People, Industry, etc.) will drive the market to
              a strong economy. I love this plan as it makes the current producers irrelevant, if they want to stay in the past so be
              it. DNR may not be able to handle the flood of inquiries for exploration! Again thanks for the news!

               Fw: Best News Ever On In-State Gas                                                                                   Page 2 of 2


                     Commissioner Tom Irwin

                     Jim Kauffman



                      You spoke to me, if you remember, after the Soldotna AGIA meeting. I was glad to hear your passion in describing
               the three big needs before us. 1. The Big Line 2. In State Gas 3 . Cash Relief.



                       I could not agree more



                        The State is at a watershed moment that if we fail to navigate carefully all three of the objectives may be lost in
                endless litigation and political in fighting , which would delight some parties.



                       I have passed on your thank you to those pushing for in-State gas, but would suggest that Governor Palin is great
               position to sail through these rough waters . There seems to me to be a clear path that would take #3 Energy Relief Plan
               ($1,200) add to it #2 limited in-State plan and it equals a guarantee win for #1 being a Trans Canada unanimous victory in the
               big pipe.

                        Simply move now on In-State gas with a pipe that can give open access in Cook Inlet, Mat-Su , Glennallen-Beluga to
               Delta--. State 60% Trans Canada 10% . Trans Canada wins favor by providing gas to people of Alaska co-operating with
               ANGDA (state Corp.). Trans Canada's big line starts in Beluga and lets T.C. decide ultimate size customers will determine
               final plans. Mitsubishi Corp. may be a good customer from Glennallen South, let T.C. decide. Pipe size North of Delta, East
               of Delta T.C. can do it. Enstar bullet from Delta or whatever is best for Fairbanks . ANGDA's marketing plan is great, give
               them a chance to be involved.

                        If Governor Palin re-committed to In-State with T.C. as builder, ANGDA as a benefactor, State funds to bridge the
               gap for gas to Fairbanks, CNG to others etc. is much better than cash distribution . I want a good economy and local jobs, not
               just a bigger PFD and Energy Credit. My belief is that people would see this as Government for the people not just
               Government for the State Budget . This could benifit if it was before the vote.



                       Sincerely,

                          Jim Kauffman

                          Candidate for Senate District Q (Republican)

               Subject: Port Authority Has No Involvement with BBIII Ad




               Governor Sarah Palin

               Members of the Alaska State Legislature

               Commissioner Tom Irwin

               Commissioner Pat Galvin

               Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford



               As a result of misinformation that is circulating about the Alaska Gasline Port Authority's (AGPA) involvement with the
               recent Backbone III (BBIII) ad, I felt it imperative to set the record straight. Please be assured that AGPA has not been a
               BBIII participant and was not involved in the formation, approval or financial sponsorship of the ad. AGPA was initially
               listed in the left-hand column of the ad. However, AGPA Chairman Bert Cottle immediately requested that AGPA's name
               be removed and you will note that AGPA is not listed in the latest version of the ad. Not one dime of AGPA funding has
               been used for the BBIII ad.



               The only ads AGPA has been responsible for are the recent ads regarding its partnering with Mitsubishi Corporation and
               Sempra LNG. The purpose of these ads is to announce and celebrate these significant developments which have been in the
               making for a long, long time. AGPA has never stopped laboring to assemble all of the parts and pieces of the LNG project.
               With diligence, professionalism and nose-to-the-grindstone, we will continue in that vein.



               I encourage each of you to contact me personally by email or phone (278-7000 office or 223-8530 cell) if you have any
               questions or concerns regarding this or any other AGPA related matter.



               Regards,




               9/18/2009
