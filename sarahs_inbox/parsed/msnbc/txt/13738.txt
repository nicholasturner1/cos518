            MESSAGE:

            This is Timothy Durako from the Alaska Military Youth Academy. While in the Program the
            entire 3rd platoon helped set up for the Kenia Classic. While there you had told me and a
            few other cadets about working for you in your office filing papers or doing odd jobs. I
            was wondering if this offer is still good.

            Attended but did not graduate class 07-1,

             reattended and graduated class 08-1.
