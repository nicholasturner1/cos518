  Thanks Kris - I have forwarded this letter to Mike Nizich also. We have not received this letter in the
  Juneau office as of the last mail drop at 8:30 a.m. this morning. I will let you know when we do receive it
  and what staff assistant it will be assigned to. Thanks, Janice

  Todd, you may have already seen this and I'm sure you heard it on news.
  Janice and I have talked about it and she is seeing if the letter has been recd.
  It's dated Friday, so it likely hasn 't come in yet.
