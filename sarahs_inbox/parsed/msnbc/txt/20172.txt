         Any chance of the Wednesday Bethel trip for the region's health care event? 700 people.
         Sen.Stevens just told me he's going up just for two hrs and returns the same day.

             Hi Janice. I'm forwarding this message to you for handling because I don't know what Gov. Palin's
             schedule is today, or when she will see my message. Would you please make sure it gets to her? Please
             let me know if you receive this. Thank you.

             Hello Gov. Palin.

             I will be arriving in Anchorage Saturday night [8/9] and plan to start work on Monday
             morning the 11th. I'm in the process of finalizing the details of renting private office space
             in downtown Anchorage and hope to have that completed soon.

             Since we've never met, I would like to come by your office for a couple of minutes to say
             hi. What I have in mind is just a quick meet and greet, not a big deal, and not to talk about
             the case either. I just want to introduce myself and meet some of your staff. By then I
             should have my office location details and contact info ready for you. I appreciate your
             willingness to cooperate with me, and this informal meeting can serve as a good ice breaker
             for both of us. Can we meet, say Tuesday 8/12 ? [pick a time].

             Also, since my work is expected to take a couple of months, I think it would be a good idea
             if you could designate someone close to you to be my contact person to handle requests for
             information, and basically act as mission control between us in the event you are
             unavailable.

             I've heard its rainy and cool up there, so it will be a welcome relief from our dry and hot
             weather here in SC.

             Regards-

             Steve Branchflower
