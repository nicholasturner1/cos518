Todd,



Becky Weimer (DOL) sent this, it's for you, the Governor and the Lt. Governor. Janice will let me
know what the Governor decides. I can send you more information if you're interested.



The Governor's Safety Conference request from Grey Mitchell:



To welcome participants and present awards during the luncheon ceremony scheduled on March 21,
2008 from 12:00 to 1:00 pm. They are expecting up to 250 participants.



They noted that it's a great opportunity to address a significant group of Alaskans dedicated to
improving workplace safety and health in Alaska.



Let me know if you' re interested.



Erika
