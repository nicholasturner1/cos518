             Governor,



             I just got off the phone w/Andy Mack and Tara Sweeney. They are unable to reschedule the
             10:30 am meet and greet Joe arranged w/ARSC due to the start of the festival at 12noon.
             So, unfortunately the 8am departure time from Wasilla Airport still stands.



             They will have a hospitality room for you and your family should you need it.



             Those we have for the flight: Governor, Trig, Piper, Ivy and Kelly. Ivy's car will be at
             Anchorage airport for the commercial return home. She'll also have a seat carrier for Trig
             for Barrow and the return.



             Joe will not be in Barrow, but Commissioner Galvin will be. Bob will meet you in Barrow
             also.



             Also, as an FYI I spoke w/Joe today and the gasline team needs to brief you on Tuesday
             regarding an AGPA response. This can be done by phone if necessary.



             Kris
