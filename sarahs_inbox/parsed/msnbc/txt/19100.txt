           Subject: Senator Green's letter




           Just want you to know that I responded to Lyda's letter today by calling Portia and
           discussing possible dates for a briefing. They cannot (truthfully) turn the tables on us
           and claim we did not respond. I followed up with an e-mail and offered to work with her
           to set up the most convenient date and time. I am waiting to hear back from Galvin about
           next week, for starters.
