          We received it on Friday. I forwarded it to the Department of Revenue folks to make sure
          our presentation for legislators on Tuesday would address the question.



          The same question was asked on Tuesday by Rep. Gara--and you answered directly that
          administration officials will be free to explain how we got to ACES and that our experts
          will be free to comment directly and freely.
