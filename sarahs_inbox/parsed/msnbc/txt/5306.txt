                  I did laugh at the family salmon farm...

                  Good to know. We'll probably try to work on something for later next week as we quickly
                  approach Day 100.

                  Meghan:

                  I'm available just about any time you need, in person or by phone if necessary.

                  As for this particular IntraFish correspondent, he is blowing his own horn a bit; plus, you have to wonder
                  about a guy who thinks that the Governor of Alaska has a family salmon farm...

                  Let me know, DL.

                  Will there, be time for all of you to sit down and discuss fish policy? We have numerous
                  requests like this one and we need to start working through them.

                  Please tell me what's possible and if the request below is as well.

                  Hello Meghan,

                  I spoke with Sharon on the phone on Friday and she suggested I e-mail you this request to interview Gov. Palin
                  by telephone sometime in the next two weeks.

                  As you know , IntraFish is the leading source of information for the world ' s seafood industry and there is a lot of
                  interest and curiosity from people in our community about what the governor ' s vision is for the Alaska seafood
                  sector, what goals she has for the industry and how she plans to make her vision a reality . As we did with Gov.
                  Murkowski ( his interview appeared in our February 2005 issue ), we propose a straight question -and-answer
                  format where the governor ' s responses are recorded and transcribed verbatim , with some minimal editing
                  possible to fit the story into whatever it's assigned space will be in the April issue . We have an Alaska Focus
                  section running in the paper that month, and her comments would be the centerpiece of the section.

                  While I won' t provide a list of questions beforehand, I will be happy to provide a guideline of sorts so she could be
                  prepared to speak on the particular topics I would like to address . The interview should last about 20 minutes to a
                  half hour. I would need to have it completed before the end of business on Friday , March 9, as I am off to Boston
                  then for the big seafood show , and will have to prepare the paper for production upon my return.

                  We also would request some photos of the governor , especially any that show her at her family 's salmon farm, or
                  in some seafood-related capacity if possible.

                  I am in the office each day from 5 : 30 a.m. to 2 p . m., so feel free to call or e-mail with any questions . I would like to
                  finalize an interview time by the end of this week and conduct the interview next week , the earlier in the week the
                  better.

                  Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you on this.

                  Cheers,
