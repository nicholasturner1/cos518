            Right. Too many people have my account now, so I'm telling others to go throu h the
            website. You can try asking him for list of issues (or give to Randy- it's Privirelated,
            Kristine Klein can help), maybe he'll communicate with others before he con ac s me again.

            Governor - you asked that this email be forwarded to you. If you'd like I can ask that
            they list the issues so that you are not giving them direct access to your account.
            Thanks, Janice
