           MESSAGE:

           So, you had a bill on your desk for a prescription drug database, and you chose to let it
           become law *without* your signature. You're a coward. God forbid our state's executive
           "leadership" would have to make a decision about the relative merits of any given bill.
           You appear to be a coward in any situation that doesn't have an apparent groundswell of
           support.




           That makes you a poll-driven governor, much like the Clinton Presidency was. Exactly what
           Alaska needed.  It also makes you a liar, since you have done nothing demonstrate that
           you're the conservative or family-centric person you claim to be.
