             No problem using the pic. Erika! And your questions are no bother at all!

             Remind Steph that I boiled all the eggs that I found in the fridge last night - sorry I nabbed them if she
             needed them for anything today.

             Thanks!

             Hello Governor,

            The Governor's Prayer Breakfast (Lunch this year) would like to run a TV, ad for the event. Would it be
            okay with you- to use your official picture? Andy Mills is sending a few other pictures over. The
            advertisement would basically show a few pictures and say something like.."Come join us as we honor,
            support, and pray for Governor Sarah Palin" followed by the information for the event.

            I apologize for bothering you with questions , we just don't want to over-step our bounds or use
            something that we shouldn't.

            Thanks!
            Erika
