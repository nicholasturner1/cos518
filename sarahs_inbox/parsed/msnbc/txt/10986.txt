             Governor, Mile Post is OK with the schedule. We advised them it is a one time thing and
             won't happen next year. I told staff to check again with all publications (including MP
             again) of the schedule problem and getting it out. AMHS will get back to me ASAP. I will
             let you know the results. LEO

            Governor:



            The new draft schedule has not been submitted to publications.



            The draft schedule is open for public comment -- written through Jan. 10 (tomorrow) and
            two teleconference scheduled for Jan. 11.



            The schedule may see some adjustments based on the public comment. The final schedule will
            be available no later than Feb. 12. DOT hopes to have it available before that date.
                                                                1
