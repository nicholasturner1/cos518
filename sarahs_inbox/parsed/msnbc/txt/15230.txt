           Governor-

           Channel 2 wanted an interview during your budget meetings. Commissioner Galvin responded
           to the same LNG questions on Monday. When I contacted Joe Balash about it today he said we
           had nothing new to offer Channel 2 as far as a message. Mike Ross was fine with that. They
           ran Galvin's comments for 2 days Monday and Tuesday.

           It was reported tonight on ktuu that I wasn't available for the interview they requested
           today. I did not know they had requested any interview to answer Hickel's complaint about
           AGIA. If I wasn't available then perhaps an AGIA person should have complied with their
           request. No doubt I'll be asked by them tomorrow to comment anyway - so I'd rather have
           spoken to them today so we didn't have that "no comment" response.



           Also, Kris: are Joey and/or Kristan and/or DNR folks familiar with MatMaid going to
           respond to Samuels' and other leggies' audit findings of today?
