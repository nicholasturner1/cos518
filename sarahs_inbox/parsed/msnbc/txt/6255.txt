        We cant afford it, the Feds won't pay for it, the general populace isn't placing it as a
       high priority... can you diplomatically express that ?!    Of course we want infrastructure
       - and this is NOT a " bridge to nowhere" (that is so offensive ), but as it stands today
       with the highest - cost bridge design selected by the Ketchikan community , we need to find a
       lower - cost alternative is a bridge will be built.

         Don't know if you are reading your BB during the cabinet meeting, but if I get a question
        from the audience at noon (Ketchikan Rotary) about the Ketchikan bridge. What's your
        current view?
