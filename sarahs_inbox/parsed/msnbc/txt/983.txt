I have checked directly with the airlines and that mid-morning fit is completely sold out. I am
checking one more avenue and will know shortly. Janice

Any idea if Ak Air has a seat available on the 11-ish fit today, instead of me waiting for the late fit I'd
better get to Juneau sooner. If you could look, that'd be great. Thanks (I already let janice know to try
finding a seat, but most time security has that automatic "they're full" reply)
