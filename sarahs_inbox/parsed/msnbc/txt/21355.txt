             That must be the same one Balash found; he was waiting for the right time to reveal. I
             hope the reporter does something with the info. If not, maybe the time is right now for
             Joe to do something with it.

             policy then he would come back to jnu angry and pounding on the table demanding answers.
             Now today he says he doesn't know why he's here and doesn't think there is anything wrong
             w ppt! What a flippin flip-flopper! What happened to the accountability in what you say
             and do?!? If this doesn't come out in a story (which I think it will) than I'm making sure
             it comes out in a letter to the editor.
