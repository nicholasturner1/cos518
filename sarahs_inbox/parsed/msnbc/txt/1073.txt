Okay-




I am pretty sure that the Foster fundraising stuff won't make it in the ear. If by chance it does - we
will be in there refuting it. I reminded Sheila of the bill signing in Foster's office WITH HIS SON. I also
told her that Todd called Foster in the hospital. I told her that the thought of the governor refusing to
do anything to help him is sick. She agreed.




What is definitely going to make it in this weekend is that fact that Tuckerman threatened Linda
Menard! Sheila is not going to contact Tuckerman before it runs. And yes, I am smiling as I write
this. .J
