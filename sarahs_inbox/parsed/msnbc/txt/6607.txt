        Dear Mr. Cook:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to                 meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means , and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

       Governor

        Thank-you for following-through on your pledge to reduce spending. I think you are

        the best thing to happen to Alaska in many years!



        I met you a few times briefly, and think you can help Alaska become a better place to

        live.
