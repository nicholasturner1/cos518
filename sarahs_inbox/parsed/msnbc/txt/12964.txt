              We elected you to do a job and you're doing it !!                Congratulations for

              holding down State spending.        You are the right person at the right time,

              to create a lasting legacy for Alaska. We admire and are thankful you are

              doing all of the right things; things lesser people simply can't seem to

              do.   We pray you stay the course and continue to save and invest for our

              wonderful State.



              The next time you are east of Fairbanks on the Chena Hot Springs Road,
