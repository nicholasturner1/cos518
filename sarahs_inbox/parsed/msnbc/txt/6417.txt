         Sharon- would u correct with Steve Quinn the fact that I've only traveled outside once
         since session ended? He wrote online (will be printed tomorrow) that I've spent my time
         traveling out of state during the interim. The correction is I was in Michigan for the two
         days before traveling to Kuwait, but otherwise have been wrking from Anchorage and
         traveling within the state.



         Also, ktuu made it sound like we'll have details on sp sess tomorrow, incl location and
         incl Pat's analysis. He's not ready to reveal findings on that, nor propose solutions yet,
         so tomorrow's messaging will have to be well thought out. We also dont have location
         chosen yet either as fairbanks and Anchorage will hopefully be competing for the session
         (Kris spoke with mayor whittaker on this, I haven't heard yet if anything was decided from
         their conversation and/or other conversations with the Capt Cook in Anchorage...).



         I'll cc the others so they can help with messaging for tomorrow. I will focus on taking up
         Speaker Harris' request to revisit ppt back many weeks ago and the reasons he gave then as
         to why leggies need a sp session.
