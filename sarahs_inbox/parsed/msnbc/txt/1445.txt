Good photo on the printed Clarion as well.



And someone named Teedah left a "Sarah Rocks!" comment on Clarion's blog. Hmmm.

Good morning Frank,



The local newspaper, Peninsula Clarion, had a nice article in today's paper

on the Governor's visit to Kenai yesterday. Work called me away from the

event yesterday so I was unable to catch up with you, but we will see each

other soon I'm sure. Have a great day Frank.



Chuck

With tourism business leaders and government officials watching, Gov. Sarah Palin signs a bill into
law that will cut the price of a business license from $100 per year to $50 per year during a ceremony
at Kenai Landing on Wednesday afternoon. She also signed into law a bill that will lower from 50
percent to 30 percent the funds tourism trade associations will have to provide to match state funds.
