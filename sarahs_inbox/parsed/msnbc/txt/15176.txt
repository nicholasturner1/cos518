          Dear Governor Palin,

                  Ms. Hite has not waived her rights. In June there will be a follow-up hearing.
          Talis

            Hi.   She did not. I handled the arraignment. Next hearing (status) is first week of
            June.   Have not heard from anyone that she intends to waive.

            Hi, I talked to Rick this morning.  He asked me to ask you to please send him an email and
            let him know if Morgan Hite waived extradition. Thanks
