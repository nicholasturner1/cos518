               OK, since the state is paying me to think and use my experience, I figure I might as well give my
               opinions until told otherwise.

               Tom Kizzia of A D N interviewed me for over an hour today on PAC West and the State's energy
               education effort.

               I did my best to focus Tom's attention on the reasons for an information campaign, the components
               of the effort, our basic messages, and the changed situation in Congress and its consequences for
               responsible oil and gas development. Tom kept coming back to PAC West. I reminded him that the
               PAC West contract came to us from the legislature, explained why such work is important to the
               total effort, described how their activities are supervised by us and the grant administrator, and told
               him that we insist on transparency and on a non political approach based on the merits.

               I refused to comment on PAC West's prior history, just on what they do for the State and mentioned
               that the Governor is opposed to sole source procurement's. I also indicated that with public funds
               involved, we hold our contractors to a very high standard and utilize State officials to do as much of
               the work as possible. Nevertheless, there is a need to spread Alaska's energy message beyond the
               Capital Beltway, as our opposition does on a regular basis.

                Tom said he called me, because this was suggested by other Administration Officials. Privileged or ^

                think things will come out alright.

                The story will p robably appear on Friday. Just wanted you to know.
