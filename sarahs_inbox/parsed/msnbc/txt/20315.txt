          I read that the annual picnic was this evening, and it was noted that I wasn't there. If
          anyone asks, I was not there be I did not know about it, never saw any invitation - as far
          as I know I was not invited. Janice may have seen somthing come through invitations, she
          may verify, but I didn't receive anything on this.
