              Kris:




             A letter from Sen. Kookesh is attached along with a draft response from

             the Governor.     I tend to write in "legalese" a bit so feel free to edit.




             When edits are complete, please print and give to the Governor with a

             copy of his initial letter for her review.



             Thanks,



             Randy

             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,

                    With the amount of money the state has this year I do not believe that it is
             necessary to cut items from the budget. It looks like you are vetoing things just to show
             that you are in charge, not the legislature. Items may not seem important to you, but they
             are important to the people.
