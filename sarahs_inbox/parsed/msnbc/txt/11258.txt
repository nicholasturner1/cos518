             Thanks Governer for thinking of our children's futures. I was beginning to think that
             sleeze and corruption were the norm in politics. It sounds like you are going to prove me
             wrong . Thank you.

             Best wishes for our children' s futures,

             Lisa Cruz, a formerly die hard Democrat.
