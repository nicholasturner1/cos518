  Boundary commission makeup shifts
  Staff Report
  Published May 9, 2007

  The faces are changing at the state 's Local Boundary Commission.

  Chairman Darroll Hargraves announced last week that he will step down from the commission
  this summer. The news follows the April resignation of Tony Nakazawa, who until last month
  represented the state's Fourth Judicial District - which includes Fairbanks - for four years on
  the commission.

  The Local Boundary Commission considers proposals to create , or alter the boundaries of,
  municipal governments.

  Hargraves, a Wasilla resident, is leaving in order to "seek new business opportunities and
  political options that may be available to me in coming months."

  Nakazawa left the commission April 30. A former director of the University of Alaska Fairbanks
  Cooperative Extension Service, he is in the process of moving to southcentral Alaska to take a
  post at the UAF Palmer Research and Extension Center.

 Nakazawa said the commission and its staff have a difficult job. "We're fortunate to have those
 people, the ones that have served before and the ones that will come in the future."
