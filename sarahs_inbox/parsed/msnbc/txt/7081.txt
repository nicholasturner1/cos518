              Governor - the department of law reviews all legislation and appropriations prior to your signature. The
              back up for these legislative additions is an important part of the review. I am not familiar with the school
              that is mentioned but will find out more and get information as soon as possible. I think it is totally
              appropriate for you to defer questions on specific projects. It will take the next few weeks to go through all
              of this and make recommendations to you. The public needs to know you will look at all of the projects
              and are committed to a reasonable and responsible budget. Hope this is helpful. Karen

              Speech is about 10-15 minutes and then Q &A for roughly 10 minutes.A After that, Bill McAllister (and any others
              who are there) would like a moment of your time (less than 5 minutes) to speak regarding speech . At that point, you
              need to get back to office for agriculture briefing. I will be there and herd the media.

              Additionally, Les Gara is upset about a $50,000 appropriation from Kevin Meyer for Gateway School and Learning
              Center aE" a Christian school for dyslexic students . Gara argues it is clearly unconstitutional .A McAllister wanted
              to know if youaTMve had the chance to look at the capital budget yet.A I told him that you have asked for
              departmental and legal reviews of the capital budget and that you will look at the merits of each.A Additionally, he
              asked since you are so pro-Constitution he doubted that you would push the line on any Constitutional budget issue.
              I said that was fair but that certainly our legal departmental review will also provide insight into whether something
              is or isnSETMt Constitutional .A I told him that in addition to measuring the Constitutionality , you are a fiscal
              conservative and will look at the appropriations as to whether government should be supporting these projects or if
              there are other means.
