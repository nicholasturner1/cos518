         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor Palin;rnrnCurrently the State of Alaska provides the sum of $612,000 to
         three veterans groups as set up under the JOINT VENTURE GRANT AGREEMENT. The American
         Legion, the VFW, and the Disabled Vets organizations each get $207,000(each annual budget)
         for their service officer work on behalf of Alaska veterans.rnrnIt is a certainty that the
         current military environment will create a greater need for our veteran population in the
         coming years.rnrnWe in the Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH) also have a Service
         Officer who provides important assistance to the wounded veterans of our State. Our MOPH
         Service Officer also supports the needs of all veterans and has the same needs as the
         other groups. Further more I must point out that the other three groups are provided
         office space by VA, while we have had to find other office space outside of VA to conduct
         our important work. We within the Alaska MOPH believe strongly that we have been left out
         and are just as deserving o

         f this state assistance as the other veteran groups. However it is important that the
         State of Alaska does not forget that we (the MOPH) are the only group of veterans that
         consists entirely of members who actually spilled their blood in combat.rnrnWe have
         absolutely no desire to take anything away from the other fine veteran organizations, we
         simply believe that we are just as deserving and we believe that we should receive equal
         and fair treatment.rnrnTherefore, we are asking that we, The Military Order of the Purple
         Heart, (MOPH) Department of Alaska, receive equal treatment in the money granted by the
         State of Alaska for our Service Officer work on behalf of Combat Wounded Veterans as well
         as all other veterans. We are asking that we receive a sum that is equal to the amount
         awarded to the other veteran groups.rnrnWe will be pursuing this matter through our
         elected representatives, but we are asking that you give the full support of your office
         to this very worthy cause in the nex

         t budget cycle.rnrnPlease let us know you!
                                                                1
