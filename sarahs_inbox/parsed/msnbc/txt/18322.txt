         Sorry I did not send you an update friday.              We talked about making the changes
         all at once and I got caught up in getting it done while addressing some sensitive areas.
         I knew Gene had mentioned something to his group on thursday. He was not intentionally
         leaking but more of a darn the administration for stealing my staff. I also knew that
         Chris Clark and Mary Jackson (with Tom Wagoner) both wanted the job. in addition, I
         wanted to avoid a nasty phone call from Lyda or others critizing us for hearing from the
         minority first.



         After confirming with Russ, Heather, and Randy, I talked to Chris and let him know we were
         going to do things differently. I asked him to speak with Larry Hartig about a special
         projects position in his department. Minutes after I talked to him, Bitney called
         Heather. I can not say for sure if it was due to Chris or Gene's comment. I notified Mary
         Jackson and then called Lyda and Harris. I thought that if word was going to get out that
         we were going to do things differently in order to communicate better with the
         legislature, I should start by making sure they heard from us first.



         Lyda wanted to know when we were going to hire Gene since we now have all his staff.



         Anyway, sorry for the late update.



         Mike

        Nope. I wasn't given any official word on this... so I guess there's no real "leak" on
        this specific matter.



        Ear still got it wrong making it sound like we're adding more staff to make up for the
        absence of the irreplaceable Bitney.

          Not sure if anyone else has replied to you yet on this. While i too am concerned about
          leaks and trust, this was one that became known on Friday. Chris was notified on Thursday
          and had an interview in Anchorage on Friday. They accepted and Mike announced the new
          structure at staff mtg on Friday. I apologize for the apparent disconnect in
          communication.

         Wonder how the Bitney replacement mention already got in the 'Ear.



         Sheeeesh - I can trust people in this business as far as I can throw them. Have the two
         even been officially offered, and accepted, the jobs yet?



         Reading the 'Ear today was another lesson for me that nothing is considered confidential
         to some folks, so fewer and fewer people should be brought in to "think out loud" re:
         admin business.
