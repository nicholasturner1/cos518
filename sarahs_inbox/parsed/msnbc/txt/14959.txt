         MESSAGE:

         Gov. Palin 1st things first. Congratulations on the birth of your_son. I am writing to
         ask for your support of Copper Valley Electric Cooperative's Allison Lake Project in the
         budget.  As a resident of the Edgerton hyway I believe this is a GREAT PROJECT. A new
         feasability study has been completed and came back positive. This is not a pipedream, the
         licience/permit has been applied for.  This is the part we need the state's help on as it
         is very expensive and we are already being overwelmed by the high cost of our energy.
         This is not an atomic energy plant not is it a coal burner. It is a small hydro plant
         being built above any spawning area without the need for a dam . It is an eco-friendly,
         non polluting, renewable energy source.   This should be the poster child for Alaska's
         energy policy. Thank you for your time and any support you can give us.    Respectfully,
         Carl
