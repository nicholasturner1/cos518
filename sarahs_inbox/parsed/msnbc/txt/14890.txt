             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the birth of your new son. My first son, Spencer was born almost 18
             years ago with Down syndrome. I am the Central District Disabled Hockey Rep for USA
             Hockey and have started the largest special needs hockey team in the US, the Tomahawks, in
             Chicago Illinois.  Spencer has played hockey since he was 6 yrs old.   I know that as a new
             mom with a baby with Down syndrome you are bombarded with information. From a veteran mom
             of a son with Down syndrome, there is no limit as to what your son will be able to do.
             Once again, congratulations on the birth of your health beautiful baby boy!

             Sincerely,

             Amy LaPoe
