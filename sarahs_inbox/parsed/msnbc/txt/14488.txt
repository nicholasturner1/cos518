          MESSAGE:

           Governor Sarah Palin,



          I want to thank you for the stand you take. You have made a tremendous statement with the
          birth of Trig! I greatly admire you for believing and doing what is right. You not only
          made a statement in giving birth to a mentally handicapped son, knowing that there would
          be challenges, but you've also made a statement in the fact that he is number five! in
          today's society, so many think two children is too many. As Christians, it is our
          privilege and responsibility to "be fruitful and multiply". If we don't, there will soon
          be very few to govern tomorrow. Larger families are a blessing and a testimony of what God
          can do! Thank you for standing!



          May God bless you!

          Loretta Miller
