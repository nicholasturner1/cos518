           J- pls set up phone call for me to speak with Mike Burns this morning-

           just real quick, I'll touch base with him on what a Gov's authority is

           re: investment/divestment of Perm Fund $$$. He hasn't asked, but he

           needs to hear from me on my opinion - and no one seems to know what a

                                                                 1

             Gov's authority is in this issue is but I will go on record with him re:

             Perm Fund divesting the half of one-percent that we ' ve got in Darfur.

             Thanks

            Russ- if you get a chance to talk to Gara or Lynn ,         let them know I do

            support their efforts on divestment . I haven ' t known what they needed of

            me, but I ' m not impressed with Mike Burns avoiding the question and

            giving Alaskans the of       " not available for comment " comment.



            If asked ,   I'm telling Alaskans I still desire to have the conversation

            with Burns to let him know my take on this        ( but he hasn ' t expressed

            interest in knowing what I'd like to do on this issue ) and I side with

            those who believe our " bottom line " shouldn"t be our sole global concern

            in this matter.



            If I can do anything to help those lawmakers , even if it's just taking a

            public stand on this, I'll do so . They can suggest ways I could help.

            Thanks
