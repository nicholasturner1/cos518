          How about a mtg tomorrow after my Stevens mtg? Janice can squeeze it in.

          Dear Governor Palin,

                 I just had a meeting with Mr. Tibbles about the VECO/ FBI issues and I think a
          meeting with you soon would be helpful to follow up on the memo I sent you and the issues
          related to our options. I know you are out of town right now.    If I could meet with you
          Friday afternoon I think it would be helpful. Maybe 2:00 pm? Talis
