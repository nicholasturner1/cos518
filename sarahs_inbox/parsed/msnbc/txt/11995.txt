          Heard from Bob last night . His oldest son, Jason, passed away on Monday and the funeral
          is today . Thought I would pass on to you guys, if you hadn ' t already heard, since he was
          such a good supporter there with Local 302 before he retired last year .   Address below
          incase you need it.
