              Your BP email did come through. The amount was interestingly a.coincidence.   After
              backing out interest penaties and and a $80 million piece that will be addressed
              separately, the BP amount came to $379.



              The museum info, I will have Karen send you more but it is a combination of deferred
              maintenance and historical preservation. The state owned museum is not in good shape or
              adequate.  I guess we have historical documents piled high.    The water pipe that broke in
              the state office building flooded a lot of books and although it was in close proximity to
              our historical photo collection, luckily they were not harmed. The new museum would
              provide safe storage for many of these unreplaceable historic items.

             I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State. I wanted to get you
             something for the 2008 speech before the end of 2007. Anyway, let me know if you think it
             is on the right track.




             I thought I would take'a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow. On
             Wednesday, I thought I would have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry
             Persily help me fact check and test sensitivity and direction. There are some items in
             the draft that have not been made public yet. Two examples are Habitat and Health Care
             reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out.




             Last year' s speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long. I tried to keep it shorter this
             time . This draft is now 3800 words, hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was
             shooting for.




             Happy New Year!
