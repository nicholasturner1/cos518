         Gov.Palin,rn   Two months ago we had sent you and your family an invite to our Premier
         Alaskan Banquet with the Freinds of the NRA.This event will be held on Oct.l9th at the
         Sheraton in Anchorage.I'm assuming since the Special session starts on the 18th and will
         be in Juneau that you will be unable to attend, but as of yet I haven't recieved a
         response either way.Please let me know as I have set aside a Table sponsored by Weld-Air
         in the event you may be able to attend.If you are not able please let Mr.Palin know we
         would be pleased if he would join us for a night of fun if his schedule allows. rn
         Thank You,rn                   Denny Hamann/Chairrn                    State Committee FNRA
