            John,

            In our call today I'd like to talk about the request I have from the NLGA regarding contacting
            our congressional delegation on the National Defense Authorization Act. Specifically, the
            NLGA passed a resolution urging Congress to repeal Section 1076 of the Act and to open a
            dialogue with governors regarding how best to enhance the effectiveness of the Guard (under
            the command of our governor) in responding to domestic disasters and emergencies . I believe
            the governor has already communicated with Congress on this and I would like to do so as
            well, assuming alignment with the governor's position . Supposedly, the standing committees
            are working in conference now on the bill . Look forward to the call.

            Sean

            Dear Lt. Governor,

            I'm writing to you to ask for your help.

            Could you please contact your Congressional delegation today, concerning Section 1076 of the National
            Defense Authorization Act?


            RESOLUTION REGARDING URGED CHANGE TO
            THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT

            As you may recall, at the NLGA's Winter Meeting last March , we passed the bi-partisan resolution cited
            above, with Lt. Gov. John Bohlinger (MT), Lt. Gov. Michael Fedele (CT), Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts
            (RI), Lt Gov Rick Sheehy (NB), Lt Gov Patty Judge (IO), Lt Gov Mark Parkinson (KS) and Lt Gov
            Anthony Brown (MD) all joining with me as co-sponsors.

           I have attached the resolution for your review.

            Senate and House Armed Services Committees are working in conference right now on this bill.

           To make certain that NLGA's strong recommendations concerning a governor 's authority over the Guard
           and Reserves are reflected in the final legislation , PLEASE JOIN ME IN FORWARDING THE
