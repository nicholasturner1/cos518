              Hello Mr. Nizich,

             A quick re-cap of information from today:

              Prisoner count is 3599 in facilities, 836 in Arizona and 630 in Half way houses. 97% of our max cap.

              Point Mack prison project is on track and on schedule. Contractor selection mid-October, Bond sale early
              November and construction in the spring of 09.

             Seward expansion (144 beds) on track and on schedule.

             Bethel project (66 beds) waiting for community council approval

             Prisoner grievances down 22%

             Correctional Officer discipline down significantly in 2008. (Currently none)

             Local telephone calls by prisoners will now be charged due to non responsive bids. $2.00 fee for a 15 to 30
             minute call.

             I'll do SHARE again.

             Thanx

             Joe

             Sure! Don't let me forget as we wrap up this mtg to have you announce the invite, since I don't have
             times in front of me. Thanks!

             Governor,

             Would you like to invite your cabinet or senior staff to the tea/reception? If so, you could extend a personal
             invitation while they're all together, and we could follow up with an email invitation so they have the details. We
             could handle about 20-25 extra guests.

             Thanks,
             Erika
