              MESSAGE:

              I think Sarah Palin should endorse Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul for
              president and possibly even investigate a spot as Vice President. I think Sarah would be a
              perfect match for Dr. Paul!



              Thanks for listening from Juneau,

              David Doyle
