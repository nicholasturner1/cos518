           Thank you so much for the invite. Mike had called our office about an hour ago and Kelly let him know I'm out of
           pocket in town until about 6 p.m. I'm also trying to reach Sandy to make sure I 'm covered there on girls' p.m.
           transport issues. Can still likely make it between 6:30-7 p.m. if you think it would be useful.
