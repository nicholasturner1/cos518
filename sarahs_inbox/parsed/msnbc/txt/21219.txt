           Governor,



          I am sorry this event was not on my radar. However, I did talk with Louise Lazur and she
          stated that only 1 seat would be saved for you, they realize there is a potential you may
          not make it since you will be in travel status, and they would only like very brief
          remarks welcoming Rabbi Michael Oblath to the State of Alaska.



          What I found out about the Rabbi:

          The Rabbi was interviewed and hired and has been in Alaska since August and this will be
          his first winter here.  He came to Alaska from Green Valley California

          He is not married, and his interests fit well for his new Alaskan lifestyle: an avid hiker
          and bicyclist; he is also a musician and has an interest in astronomy.



          This is all I could come up with--after all, I am an accountant, not a speech writer!
          Hahaha




                                                                   1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 0006531

         J- pls ask someone to jot a few things down for me then. I didnt know this was a speaking
         gig... with Mayor Begich.  Maybe Ana could find a few minutes to do so?

           I'll ask Sean P if he knows him also.



           Also, i don't need two seats - I'll just hustle in there if my flt returns from Fairbanks
           on time, I won't be traveling with anyone, so don't want a seat to look conspicuously
           empty
