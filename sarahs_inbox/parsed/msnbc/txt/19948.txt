               Governor, below is addition up to date info on KABATA based on this morning' s emails from you and Randy. LEO

                  This is a brief chronology of recent questions posed to KABATA , and their responses:

               1.On April 22, 2008, Deputy Commissioner Frank Richards wrote KABATA a letter requiring their response to a
               number of questions including an accounting of the $40 million spent to date, information about the draft RFP,
               risks associated with the project , project projected revenue, an updated cost estimate, and a question about
               the construction of the Ingra-Gambell connector.

                2. On May 28, 2008 KABATA responded to the letter from Frank Richards. The response was less than
                satisfactory, and there was some serious concerns expressed about their updated cost estimate.

                3. DOT/PF, in conjunction with Federal Highway Administration , determined it was it was necessary to secure an
               estimate update of project costs. The Request for Proposal was advertised July 9th, with a due date of 7/30.
               The work effort will be funded jointly by the FHWA, and DOT.

               4. The AMATS Policy Committee continues to have a keen interest in this project. At the July 10th meeting, the
               Policy Committee gave KABATA a series of questions to answer . Although a lot of the questions overlapped
               with questions asked by Frank Richards , or were already asked and answered in the Enviromental Impact
               Statement, many of the questions asked by members of the Policy Committee are centered around issues
               specific to the MunicipaLITY OF Anchorage.
