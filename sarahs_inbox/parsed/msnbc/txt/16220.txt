            Governor,



            Earlier today, Marvin Odom from Shell tried to reach you over the phone to deliver some
            disappointing news.  Due to the lack of ruling by the 9th Circuit, they are going to
            announce tomorrow that they are canceling their 2008 drilling program.



            Cam Toohey called me to pass on the information and stressed that this decision does not
            indicate that they have changed their long term plans for Alaska. They are going to
            continue to work on their seismic program in the Chukchi and they are going to re-start
            their plan of exploration process in hopes of getting a decision out of the Bush
            Administration before they leave office. That new plan will be for multiple years and
            will be legally engineered to withstand 9th Circuit review.



            They will start informing stakeholders in the morning, including a call to Marty. Mr.
            Odom wanted to let you know today, though.



            If you have any questions for Shell, or if you'ld like to talk to Odom, they are happy to
            arrange a call (or I can just talk to Cam).



            Joe
