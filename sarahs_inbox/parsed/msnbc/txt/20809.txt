           Governor:



           I am not sure whether Talis has gotten back to you. If he has, that information is
           probably more current then the brief status report I received from Ed Sniffen at LAW last
           week.



           Ed has started gathering information on costs, prices, etc., LAW.has also retained an
           expert economist, I believe his name is Barry Pulliam from ECONONE to analyze the data.



           Ed has also been setting up meetings with the refiners to ask them questions and get
           additional information and to speak to their experts. Ed thought that LAW may have a
           preliminary report done by the end of the year.



           I am copying this e-mail to Talis in case he has any thoughts to add or corrections to
           make.



           Thanks,



           Randy
