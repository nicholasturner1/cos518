        Yes i remember him - he was our scheduler.



        Dont you think he'd be better than Wagner ' s "unknown " nominee?



        We always MUST go with people we know ,           first.



        His number is included in your email - am I supposed to call him ? Bc i dont

        have time to. Or is that email from Chuck?

        Phil is back from his trip and ready to fill a seat. Chuck says he's

        interested in the educator seat on Community Service Commission, there's

        also that vacancy on Post Secondary Education since Ramona resigned.



        "Phil Schnieder.        You remember Phil from the

        campaign.     He has a masters in educ, admin., was a teacher and a principal,

        and he'll probably work again this coming year as the liason between the

        Anchorage School District and the legislature. I already talked to him

        about it and he wants the spot if I don't get it. You can pass this email

        on to Sarah if you'd like. Phil is in Seattle until Saturday but can be

        reached at 230-3612."
