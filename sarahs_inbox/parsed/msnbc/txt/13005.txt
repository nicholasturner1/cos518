           MESSAGE:

           I have a couple of questions/comments. 1. The earmark items for both state and us gov. I
           agree with you. If I ran my buget like the us gov and Alaska delegates want to, I'd be put
           in jail. I hope you stand your ground and VETO those earmark items that are a waste of our
           money and tell Stevens its time to get with the program. I'm tired of his wastefull
           spending. If you need some help, give me a call. Also about the gas/oil prices. Why
           can't you/us/alaskans put a limit on what the state will allow the oil companies to sell
           gas and fuel oil for in Alaska. Why open up our preserves to them, they are only going to
           gouge us more in the end. I know we don't need more laws but I think these companies have
           taken way to much advantage of the Alaskan people/ USA in general. Can't we set a
           presidence on limiting there price/profit/ in alaska.  Why give them more oil, that's not
           going to bring the price at the pump down or my fue oil bill. I know you can play hard
           ball so lets play. No matt

           er what happens you and your workers are doing an excellent job, Thanks Charlie
