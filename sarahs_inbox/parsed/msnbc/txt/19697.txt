           Channel 2 reported that Kopp was relieved of his supervisory duties when the allegation
           was made. Channel 2 didn't report that is standard procedure when there is an allegation.
           Kopp was reinstated when the charge was found to be baseless. Kopp was considering late
           today suing his accuser for defamation. lphVoleaed or Perspnal Material Redacted

          My understanding , just based on short convo with Kris , is that Kopp got an attorney and is
    i     going to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai
          woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him ? If there are any details I need to
          hear them- like when this will take place , what prompted this new action, etc.

             He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've
          had very good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
