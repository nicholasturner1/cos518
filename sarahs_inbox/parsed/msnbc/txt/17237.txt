              Larry understands the complexities of interpretting F & G regulations, as was
              evidenced by his having to pay a fine for a timing violation.on the water.

              (and humorously, it's the sign of a true SE fisherman - he's got a small
              violation on his record now, some true fishermen would say)

              As Larry evidently disclosed in the attached email from Ivy - he wasn't even on
              the water when the violation occurred, but he owned the pot so he owned up to
              the mistake.

              Sharon : is this the Larry Edfelt who was cited last year for a fishing violation , ABWE Troopers ini Juneau , fishing for crab during a closed
              season? I haven 't checked the court computer file yet so don 't know how it came out. Looks like he put his pot in 2 -3 hours before season
              opened , personal use, fined $200 , crab seized . Age 63 so looks like the same guy.

              No big deal but maybe earish.
              Regards , Sheila

                                                          Governor Palin Fills Vacancy on Board of Fisheries


                    March 8 , 2007, Juneau , AK - Governor Palin today announced the appointment of Juneau resident , Larry Edfelt, to the
                    Alaska Board of Fisheries . Edfelt previously served on the board from 1992-1997.

                    "I am honored that someone of Larry's stature and experience has agreed to come back and serve the state again on
                    this Important board, " said Governor Palin. "He 's familiar with Alaska fisheries from a number of vantage points. His
                    vision and temperament are just what this board needs."

                    Edfelt retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in 1986, after a distinguished 23-year career. He served
                    as a fisheries biologist, Deputy Director of Commercial Fisheries, and Assistant Executive Director of the Boards of
                    Fisheries and Game before his retirement. He has also worked as a charter boat owner and operator. Edfelt Is well
                    known around Alaska for his humorous columns published in the Juneau Empire and the Anchorage Daily News.

                    The seven members of the Alaska Board of Fisheries are appointed by the Governor, subject to legislative confirmation,
                    to conserve and develop the fishery resources of the state. This involves setting seasons, bag limits, methods and
                    means for the state's subsistence, commercial, sport, guided sport, and personal use fisheries, and It also involves
                    setting policy and direction for the management of the state's fishery resources. The board is charged with making
                    allocative decisions, while the Department of Fish and Game is responsible for management based on those decisions.

                    Edfelt will participate as a voting member at the Board' s next meeting, from March 9th to March 13th in Anchorage,
                    during which the board will take up statewide finfish and supplemental issues . If confirmed by the Legislature, Edfelt
                    will fill the seat vacated by Rupe Andrews of Juneau, who resigned last month.

                                                                                        ###

             Governor,

            Some of the biggest names in Hollywood are flying into Valdez tomorrow to begin shooting
            a summer blockbuster movie. Local hire, local extras, local outfitters / helicopters / boats /
            ERA aviation are all part of the deal. They've even hired one of Alaska's own film companies
            (Sprocketheads) and filmmaker Steve Rychetnik (he shot the Halcro campaign ads) to help
            shoot the opening see to the movie "Transformers" - Rychetnik is brilliant and they
            recognize his film talents.

            While you can't physically welcome them to the state, it would be fantastic for you to call
            the producer, Ian Bryce, and welcome him to Alaska and tell him how pleased and excited
            you are that he chose our state and is investing in our state. I guess the wild weather in
            Valdez has proved to` be a bit trying (high winds harming a prop boat in the water), but you
            can tell him you've tried your best to order up good weather for this weekend. Tell him you
            are sorry that you can't personally say hello, but wish him the best on this film and hope to
            see him again, In our great state. This would provide tremendous collateral for you and for
            the state.

            Bryce produced the following films. More information follows below.

             Meg,

             SEE BELOW

             Thank you!

             I suggest going to www.imbd.com and providing Gov. Palin with information on Ian Bryce (Producer) and Michael Bay (Director). Steven
             Spielberg is the Executive Producer and this is a Dream Works film. It is a HUGE summer blockbuster opening on July 4th 2007
              www.transformersmovie.com These guys are at the top of the food chain in Hollywood.

             We are shooting in Columbia Bay on March 10th. We're basing out of Valdez.

             They are bringing about 50 A-list production people from LA and spending lots of money - local hire, accommodations, rental cars, ERA
             aviation, helicopters, boats, outfitters, clothing stores, local actors as Extras, safety teams, etc.

             The production company that is coordinating this whole production is Anchorage based SprocketHeads, LLC (a good word about us would
             be bonus!) and Steve Rychetnik - SprocketHeads' cameraman - will be shooting film along with their team.

             Ian and Michael are flying in to Valdez on Michael Bay's jet early Friday morning, March 9th. They leave Sunday.

             We are shooting the opening scene of this movie here in Alaska so Alaska will be showcased to billions of people.

             The weather outside of Valdez has been problematic and causing stress because we are building a prop ship on-location in Columbia Bay -
             and are having problems getting on-location to work on it - so she can joke about taking care of the weather for them.

            We want them to keep them coming back and shooting in Alaska and next trip they should come to the mansion for dinner (most states do
            that for lead actors and celebrity producers and directors).

            Meg, I hope the Governor realizes this is so FANTASTIC for Alaska and Alaskans.

            Call me if you need anything and thank you. (I'm taking the ERA flight out to Valdez tomorrow afternoon so call me at Sprox -248-4829,
            cell -440-9478 and home -349-4901 if you need anything) Also please let me know when the call was made. Staying at the Best Western

              Please pass on that I would be delighted to speak to the Governor at
              her convenience . best number is my office , which is 310-244-3883.
              I am in the office today and tomorrow and we are scheduled to fly to
              Alaska on Friday.
              There would be no requests that I would be making of her in that
              phone call . It would be about how happy we are to be coming etc.
              Ian
