          I spoke to Whitaker yesterday, he is emailing a proposal today on Fairbanks. The Arctic
          Energy Summit is being held in Anchorage at the Cook 10/15 - 10/18. And some other area
          hotels may be involved. I'm finding out more. That doesn't disclude their assistance but
          it will present some challenges. The other option discussed was the Egan Center.



          I'll talk w/Mike Tibbles today.

          Kris and Mike: What is the latest on Fairbanks asking for sp session - and did Malcomb
          ever answer back on cpt cook for a sp session venue?



          Mike - is Nizich still the lead on sp session logistics? I've not heard anything from him
          on sp session info that's needed to make good decisions on location selection and time is
          zipping by, as I expressed back in May when we first started discussing ideas on sp
          session.



          Polling leggies got us nowhere except criticism for me not "taking a stand" and concluding
          where it should be held. Lyda refuses to give input, yet wins the argument then that I'm
          the only governor who "hasn't worked with..." the leggies on a special session. (Her
          claim.) Meanwhile, we're waiting to hear any info on logistics that I need in order to
          make a good decision asap.



          The sooner I get the info, the better. If Nizich isnt the go-to guy on this, pls find a
          SouthCentral contact person so info can be gathered asap so good decisions can be made
          asap on locale. Thanks!
