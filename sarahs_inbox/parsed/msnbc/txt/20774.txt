           Governor -



           Total Energy appropriations for FY08 and FY09 = $672.4 million

           Of that amount $225.7 million is for alternative/renewable energy



           What was actually appropriated by fiscal year

           FY08 $458.6 million (includes $111.5 million for alt/renewable)



           FY09 $213.8 million (includes $114.2 million for alt/ renewable)




           Total that you requested.

           FY08 $319.8 million

           (includes the $250 million for the energy fund)



           FY09 $49.8 million




           The $138.8 million difference between what you requested and what was appropriated in FY08
           is largely due to the swap of our $250 million energy fund request (increasing it by $50M)
           and appropriating into the $200 million for weatherization and $100 million for energy
           efficiency - and then including $50 million for the renewable energy fund, $18.8 million
           for Swan Lake-Tyee intertie and a host of other legislative additions.



           The $164 million difference between what you requested and what was appropriated in FY09
           is $60 million for energy efficiency home grants; $50 million into the renewable energy
           grant fund, $25 million for Fire. Island Wind Farm, $12.5 million for Sitka Blue Lake Hydro
           project, $4.8 million for Chaninik Wind Group Regional Wind Energy Systems and a host of
           other legislative additions.



          .These appropriations include renewable/alternative energy projects along with electrical
           system repairs, renovations, upgrades, etc...




                                                                  I




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0023857

           The biggest alternative / renewable projects over the two years are:

           $100 million to the Renewable energy fund,

           $46.2 million Swan Lake - Tyee intertie,

           $25 million Fire Island wind farm,

           $12.5 million for Sitka Blue Lake Hydro Project,

           $4.8 million for the Chaninik Wind Group Regional Wind Energy Systems,

           $2.5 million for Susitna Hydro Study



           This DOES NOT INCLUDE oil and gas /natural gas projects or bulk fuel projects  Please let
           me know if you need more - I apologize for the length of time this has taken. Karen

          Subject: RE: Alt energy




          In the FY09 budget we ended up with

           $100 million in the AEA renewable energy fund (you had proposed $250 million but the
           legislature spread it out at $50 million per year and the added another $50 during the
           special session)



          Weatherization/Energy Efficiency - $300 million was appropriated to these programs in the
          regular session and another $60 million was added during the special session. We did not
          proposed this - it was added by the legislature




          We also had some $14 million for alternative energy in the budget that was funded -
          through AEA for work with the Denali Commission and others



          Fire Island Wind Farm $25 million Railbelt Energy



          There are others - this is off the top of my head and there is a breakdown between fiscal
          years and other details that you might need to have or we will had to provide once you
          discuss this - also, I have not been able to look back at last year's budget but the staff
          is working on this now -



          Will confirm soon!      Karen
