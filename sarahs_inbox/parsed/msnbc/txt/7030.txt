        MESSAGE:

        I was wondering if you would be interested in presenting the Balchen/Post

        Award to our airfield maintenance crew at the Anchorage International

        Airport?     The award is in recognition of our snow and ice control

        performance for the winter of 2006/2007. I understand that this is

        extremely short notice but the award is ready to presented to our crew and

        is on our manager's desk. Mr. Hartman brought this to my attention Friday

        in hopes that if you were traveling through the airport you might be able to

        stop in for a short time to present this award. if you are interested,

       please contact Mr. Dan Hartman at 266-2726, or 748-2301, or you can contact

       me.


                                                                1

        By the way , I left Mort Plumb and his staff out of this on purpose as there

         is a lot of political friction.
