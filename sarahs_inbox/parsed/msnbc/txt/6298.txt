             Subject: Sr. Executives from Williams Pipeline & Midstream asking to meet with you, Comm's Irwin, Galvin &
                      Marty R

           Governor,
           I just received a call from Williams Energy Company. Senior Executives from Williams (see list below) are asking
           to meet with you, Commissioner Irwin, Commissioner Galvin and me here in Anchorage, either Monday
           afternoon, July 23rd, or Tuesday morning, July 24th for 30 minutes. Williams Energy Company previously owned
           the refinery in Fairbanks, which is now owned by Flinthills. Williams is an energy company and their portfolio
           includes pipelines and other midstream assets. They are very interesting in participating in AGIA and therefore I
           would like to accommodate their request if possible. If you are not available I am sure the Commissioner's and I
           could meet with them, but it will not have the same impact. Furthermore, I am sure that if you could not
           accommodate these times, they would try to respond to your availability.

           The Williams attendees would be:
           Phil Wright, President Williams Gas Pipelines & Sr. Vice-President Williams Energy Co.
           Alan Armstrong, President Williams Midstream & Sr. Vice-President Williams Energy Co.
           Tim Penton, Vice-President Williams International

           Please advise how you would like to handle this request.
           Thanks,
           Marty
