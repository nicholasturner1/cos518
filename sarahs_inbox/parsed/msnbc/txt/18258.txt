          Dear Mr. Larson:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

           to swim against the flow, and keep unnecessary spending in check.



           No need to respond ,     just keep up the good work.
