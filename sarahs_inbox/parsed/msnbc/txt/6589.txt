        Dear Ms. Bettine:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control , manage our revenues and resources efficiently , and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        Just wanted to let you know that Mike and I are very proud of your veto pen. I just
        reviewed the 18 pages of cuts that were posted on the ADN page. What you did was a very
        hard task. I especially happy that you are interested in letting local government have a
        bigger roll in spending the state oil revenue through revenue sharing with local public
        comment.  This is especailly important with a state our size and the capital so far from
        the majority of the public. While I am sorry to see the Willow/Pt. Mac EIS funds cut, the
        Borough and the ARR can step up for such an important economic developement project for
        Mat Su.

        Thanks for being fiscally responcible!
