       We discussed the kids events before you left .... you said to work them in if you could get
       to FBXS and do them in one day. We could get you back to Juneau that night or early the
       next day.  Also there are two requests for Friday, May 4 in Anchorage, Anch International
       Rotary at Noon and Speech to Champions for children (Mat-Su Educators Assn, Janis Bishop)
       in Wasilla at 6:00pm Friday night that you were "considering." We just need to decide if
       you want to come back to Juneau or hop over to Anchorage after Fbx events. Then you go to
       Skagway May 6, Sunday.
