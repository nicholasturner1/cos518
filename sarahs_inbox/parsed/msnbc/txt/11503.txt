            There is a story in the adn today as well. It seems pretty clear to me that we need to
            better inform the writers out there that the royalty relief is tailored to kick in at
            lower prices and profits. Its not just a blanket relief.

            As for Conoco. . .Marty and I spoke at length on Thursday evening about what, how, and why
            to do certain things with Conoco. Due to their travel schedule back from DC, we are
            planning to have a conference call tomorrow.

         Privileged or I just got off the phone with Pat Galvin and the three amigoes are in Seattle.
            They are in agreement with me that significant thought needs to be put into the way we
            respond.

            On another speech related note- - the ADN has an article about how BP has reduced its
            spending plan for Alaska, will ENI ' s announcement come soon ? I've only heard it's in the
            works , not when they ' ll make it . ( Obviously , I won't talk about it in the FAI Chamber
            speech unless it's announced.)
