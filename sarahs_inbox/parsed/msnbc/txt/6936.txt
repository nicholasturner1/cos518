           Governor Palin,

           Here are a few things I came up with last night , although I know you and the writing crew already have some
           things in mind. Please feel free to pick and choose what may or may not work in your speech. It was great to sit
           down and write again . Whatever you say , Alaskans will be inspired by your message. This is your subject
           matter. These are the things you've been saying for years . These are just a few of the reasons I wholeheartedly
           support you and am honored to be a part of your administration . Keep up the great work, governor . Alaskans are
           proud of their leader. PS-I couldn ' t remember the exact biblical phase you mentioned , but I had "everything is
           fine" in mind when I wrote it.

           You're awesome.

           Ivy
