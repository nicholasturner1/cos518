          Next time put your little one in the pic, too! Nothing is more beautiful than a toddler.



          Keep up the great work.

         Thanks so much, Governor. That was a scene my 16-month-old and I came across on a hike on
         my day off (actually I did the hiking, while he kicks me in the back and pokes my head).
         The Turnagain Arm Trail is one of our special places. I'm glad you like the photo and
         really appreciate your taking the time to send me a note. I hope to get a chance to see it
         hanging in your offices sometime.



         Thanks again,

         Your fall colors photo that ran yesterday is the prettiest autumn

         picture I've ever seen.




         We're ordering a copy for the Anchorage office.




         You are talented - your talent captured that most beautiful scene.




         Thank you!




         Sarah Palin
