        We did ask Barbara Thompson to send the letter and she agreed. I will have to check to
        see if it is already out the door.

       Did the Educ letter go out already re: the college student loan issue? If not sent to
       margaret spelling pls hold on to it so i can study up more on the issue. Does the issue
       involve those points made in today's ADN editorial re: congrssional action on college
       loans' "middle men"?
