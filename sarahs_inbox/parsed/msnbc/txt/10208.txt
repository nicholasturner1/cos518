              Janice/Sharon,



              I spoke w/the Governor on the 12/5 press conference. We will stick with the clam time
              w/the Gov't class. The press conf should be no more than 30 minutes which will allow
              enough time for the Governor to get to the Captain Cook (5minutes from West) for her noon
              appt.



              We will just need to ensure that it starts and finishes promptly.



              Also Janice - I didn't receive the email you mentioned about the attendees for roll-out.



              Thanks

              Kris
