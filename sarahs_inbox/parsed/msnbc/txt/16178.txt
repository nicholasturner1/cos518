             MESSAGE:

             Just wanted to email a simple comment to you. I watched an interview with you the other
             day on Glenn Beck and I was very impressed. With the concerns we have regarding our
             economy and the other issues of the day I believe we do need you in the White House.




             Have a great one!




             Sincerely,




             Kimberly Mayfield
