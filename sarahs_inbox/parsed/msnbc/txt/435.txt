Subject :                State chamber


As a member of the state chamber, I just got the notic of Sarah's appearance

at their lunch meeting on the 22nd. Could be a great place to launch a

counterattack against the jim jansen and veco types. All this ties into the

corruption of our state by veco, and they still continue it through their

phony editorial page in the anch daily news. This could strngthen the

message, but I think the references back to statehood and control by outside

companies is very strong.
