              Subject: PPT
             We need folks to get together soon to strategize on PPT revisitation. Via teleconf, or email
             exchanges, or in person, we need to hustle on formulating plan to reassure public that we're on it.

             Included in this discussion needs to be PPT rate, PPT vs Gross, any violation of state laws in
             process of adoption of PPT last yr., etc.

             Thank you.

             Please be thinking about this, and consider my request to have independent auditors/investigators
             help us tackle this monumental issue.

             I will be responding to legislators in their request for special session on PPT soon. Want to make
             sure we're all on same page before responding to their call for my attention given to the idea of
             PPT Special Session. (BTW, I'm game for session on this in the fall if need be.)
