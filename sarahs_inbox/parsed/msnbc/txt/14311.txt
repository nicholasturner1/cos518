           Governor - the back up was due today but they have had to extend . Latest we heard is that
          we will not get the back up until the bill is transmitted . I do.not know when that will
          happen but expect it within the next week to ten days . I believe the legislature will want
          you to have to act while they are in special session.

            I thought back up info was due today? Also - when can I expect to be handed the budget,
          thus giving me the ticking 20 day clock for vetoes?
