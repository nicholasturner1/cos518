           Governor,

           It looks like they'll read-the bill across (from Senate Energy to Floor) and 2nd reading
           on Thursday, Third reading and Vote on Friday, with Reconsideration on Saturday. We are
           asking for a clean bill ( no amendments , including not asking for an immediate effective
           date) out of the Senate so that nothing needs to occur back in the House. This is for
           many reasons, not the least of which is that Saturday is the 60th day. We'd be happy to
           talk to you more about this either before or after the 9:00am meeting with the Minority.

           Marty
