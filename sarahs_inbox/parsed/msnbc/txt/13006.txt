                John: Once again thank you for your kind and well thought out comments on our game management
                practices. I am sure they will be discussed at our next meeting. I would never use the descriptive titles
                you assign yourself in this email, but hey, if the shoe fits! I do disagree with you that those descriptions fit
                most Americans. Just a select few who claim them for themselves such as you have. By the way, John, I
                have heard that the federal government has a predator control program in your state where they shoot
                coyotes from airplanes and also have a poison program for coyotes. I hope you are not to busy helping us
                to look into what is happening in your back yard. If you need any advice let us know. Yours truly. Bob

                --> Allowing the massacring of wolves and bears from planes because a handful of people get their
                jollies from it but against the wishes of a majority of Alaskans, who have voted twice to ban the
                practice, is the "real world" or "logical" or "reasonable"?!

                --> You call gunning down helpless animals from planes part of the "natural world," a "predatory skill,"
                "managing and competing," something that has gone on "since time immemorial," and, most
                ludicrously, "hunting"?!! Even most true hunters don't believe any of that bullshit! You're an even more
                despicable excuse for a human being than I thought.

                --> Inhumanely slaughtering wolves and bears from the air, or from anywhere, is part of the "natural
                world and God's plan" and opposing/denouncing it makes me a "hedonist non-believer"?! What fucking
                "church" do you go to or phony Bible do you read? Any doubt that you'll someday be rotting in Hell is
                now gone!

                massacring of other sentient beings, especially from planes, is "good work"?! Fuck you!

                My sincere dream is that every plane involved in this abominable endeavor crashes and bums, except for
                one that would be predatorily "managing" and "hunting" you! :)

                You should know by now that the zealots from America (Remember that place? Used to be known as the home
                of the brave and the land of the free ) have become completely dis-connected from the real world . There isnaTMt
                any logic a reasonable person can effect to debate such lunacy . Bottom line , John and his type are tyrants
                engulfed in their own self-righteousness.

                As a native born Alaskan , and more importantly a native born predator from planet earth ( I have no idea where
                aliens such as Sodrel come from ) I completely support the 100,000 plus years of hunting traditions inherited by
                me from my ancestors. That includes embracing the reality that my predatory skills derive from cognitive ability,
                not fangs and claws , and the concept that managing and competing for prey species is something that has gone
                on in the natural world ( something Sodrel obviously knows nothing about ) since time immemorial.

                If anyone in this discussion is going to hell, it is your antagonists who continue to hold close to the belief that they
                are somehow apart from the natural world and God9ET "" s plan. Their9ETMs is the way of the hedonist non-
                believers who in their arrogance believe they can erect heaven here on earth . As for me, I will continue being the
                natural born predator God created me to be , so keep up the good work.

                Eddie

                P.S. as in your case I am sure this idiot will respond to my comments . My advice to you and everyone else is
                donBET"'t waste your time paying any further attention to this kind of nonsense.

                Bob (et al.),

                a) You have no right to "manage" ( i.e., massacre) wildlife, nor does anyone else.
                b) Chasing down animals with planes and shooting them with shotguns is humane?!
                c) Wolves and bears killing moose and caribou is called nature, you dumbass.
                d) "Helpless" and "innocent" refers to you slaughtering them, not to their natural survival and hunting
                skills.
                e) I have no problem with people eating moose and caribou, so your whole infantile "Safeway"
                comparison is irrelevant and a crock of shit.
                f) The issue isn't people killing moose and caribou for food. The issue is some Alaskans barbarically
                slaughtering wolves (and bears) and lying about the reason why!
                g) You and your immoral, asshole buddies are doing all this in direct violation of federal law and against
                the wishes of a majority of principled citizens in your state.

                So, go fuck yourself and have fun rotting in Hell!!

                John : Thank you for your pleasant and insightful email in regard to our management of wildlife in Alaska. With
                informed citizens such as yourself I am sure all of the wild critters in your state are carefully and humanely
                managed . In case you are not aware 80% of the prey species in Alaska that die each year are killed by the
                helpless and innocent bears and wolves you refer to in your email. I suspect our moose and caribou don2  T^'t see
                them in the same light as you do, but then I am sure you are much more informed than they . As far as you visiting
                our state, I would have to discourage you from doing that as there are a number of vile , despicable and loathsome
                people here who do eat moose and caribou because they donfiT""t have a Safeway to buy meat from or have a
                slaughterhouse to do their killing for them . I am sure you have both so you can be a person of conscience and be
                nobler than these poor wretches . By the way, these vile people harvest about 5% of the animals each year. In
                regard to your wish for the disposition of our souls I hope you are mistaken , but if not I am sure I will see you
                there. Sincerely Bob

                Dear Alaskan wildlife officials,

                Just wanted to thank you for making my decision, and that of everyone I know, an easy one to never set
                foot in your state or knowingly support anything that has to do with Alaska. Your continued
                slaughtering of wolves from the air and otherwise, and decision to do the same to bears, is reprehensible
                in the extreme and will not be tolerated by people of conscience!

                I don't give a damn about your bogus, unfounded rationale of increasing ungulate populations for
                subsistence--read trophy and sport--hunting, only a vile, despicable, loathsome human being could
                approve of and/or participate in such a barbaric, inhumane endeavor. What the hell gives you the right to
                arbitrarily massacre other sentient beings to euphemistically "manage" them?!

                Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, but if we did anyone involved in and/or supportive of
                these decisions would suffer the same fate as what is being cruelly inflicted on helpless, innocent wolves
                and bears. Although I'm not a religious person, I take great comfort in knowing that all of you will one
                day be burning in Hell for your evil actions!

                Scornfully,
