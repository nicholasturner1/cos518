               Subject: Woldstad / Therriault Outstanding RR Issue

             Wanted to let you know that Randy Ruaro and I met with Bonne Woldstad today on their longstanding issue with
             the Railroad, right-of-ways, and potential eminent domain issues. Randy was on conference call and was able to
             get an initial briefing on what you understand is a multi-faceted and complex issue. There were a few action
             items and small steps for Bonne to take for the Therriault family homestead and Randy is going to research a
             point on the RR's Administrative Procedure which the Therriaults haven't been able to nail down. She continues
             to try to meet with Pat Gambell on their issue and will again voice their concerns over the issue at the RR Board
             meeting this Wednesday. Senator Therriault told me on Friday that he is trying to let Bonne and Ron carry the
             torch on working towards solutions.
