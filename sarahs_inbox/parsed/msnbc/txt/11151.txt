             Don't even worry about it! I heard the same thing and think it's absolutely ridiculous--
             and so does everyone I've talked to. She looks horrible and petty. Your going to watch
             your son graduate from boot camp, you've been more than accommodating w/ the Legislature.
             If Lyda doesn't show up it would be political suicide...on second thought.. .out with the
             old and in with the new.

             That Lyda!      Ugh...

             Tibbles told me she's threatening not to even show up because she doesn't like an opening-
             night, early State of State. He also told me Harris got grumpy (and petty) about it after
             talking to Lyda? Bizarre.



             Russ hand-delivered them letters about the sppech weeks ago and no one said boo. How in
             the world do things like this become "an issue"? Like Sharon said - 6pm is prime time, it
             shows we're early and ready to help these folks do their 90-day business with no
             hesitation.

             What ' s the beef Fagan is supposedly making over my 6pm speech? AP told me Lyda is fussing
             about it , said she may not come , Harris ( er, John Bitney ) reportedly wants a detailed
             explanation. AP asked if I really had a plane to catch- (how would they even know this?!).
             I explained the speech has been set for a month - and-a - half, no one complained back then...
             and my flt to travel to attend my son's graduation into the Infrantry was made AFTER the
             speech time was set.
