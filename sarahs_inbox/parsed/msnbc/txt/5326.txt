              Got it, thanks. I didn't remember the earlier money was set aside--was it actually
              appropriated or is it merely a part of our surplus? (The 300 million)

              We MUST, must remind that $300g has already been set aside by legislature for this - and
              we'll recoup contribution via lower tarrif its down the rd after contributing this amt.
              Amazing that the headlines are all about the $500g contribution.

               Hats off for this morning's 7:00 a.m. press availability!




               Pete Carran of KINY had the story on the air first, of course. And when Pete

               has something, KENI has it soon thereafter.




               (APRN had good coverage of the Governor and Marty in D.C. last night and the

               night before last.)




               To hear Pete's story, along with good quotes from the Governor and Marty, go

               Palin gas line proposal calls for one-half billion dollar capital outlay

               Governor Palin conducted a press conference in Washington ,             D.   C. this

               morning where she is outlining her gas pipeline proposal for members of

               Congress and federal authorities.



               The Governor says her Alaska Gasline Inducement Act will call for the state

               to make an initial capital outlay.



               The total capital risk is estimated at a billion dollars.
                                                                    3

               Palin ' s Natural Gas Line Team leader , Deputy Natural Resources Commissioner

               Marty Rutherford says the state will share that expense evenly with a $500

               Million outlay.



               She says that will go toward the cost of obtaining a certificate from the

               Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.



               Palin is scheduled to introduce her bill for the Legislature's consideration

               Friday.



               Developers will be asked to have their proposals ready by October . The goal

               is to select a proposal and submit a package for the Legislature's

               consideration by the end of January 2008 and to begin field work by that

               summer.



               Prior to selecting a project,      the process calls for a 60 day public comment

               period.



               Under her measure ,     applicants must provide for a minimum of five gas take

               off points in Alaska, commit to a local project headquarters in Alaska, and

               pledge to expand the pipeline project when new gas is available.



               Inducements for prospective gas line developers include lower tariffs and

               relaxed leasing laws.



               Palin is scheduled to return from Washington D. C. tomorrow .            ( Thursday)




                                                                   4
