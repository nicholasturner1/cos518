                Look forward to it. Just let me know if you plan to be in Juneau across the next eight days or so and I'll make
                something work. (I'll go to Juneau or meet you in ANC/FAI/Wasilla)

                Here's my schedule at this point for the next week (bottom line is I have flexibility to rearrange and be in a
                different town than designated every day but Tuesday and Thursday):

                Fri: Fly DCA to Seattle to ANC (could divert to Juneau if I hear before I get on the plane in Seattle tomorrow)

                Sat-Sun: ANC

                Mon-Tues :FAI (have to be in Fairbanks Tuesday for two speeches/Mon. can change)

                Wed-FRI: ANC (Thursday is Memorial Service in ANC at Ft. Rich)

                Sat FAI (AFN banquet substituting for you, I think...)

                 administer. Instead, adjust this figure.

                  §     The bill provides for more information sharing between DOR and DNR. This is good. However, the joint
                 administration proposed is unnecessary.

                  §     I recommend no changes because PPT was a great upheaval. Now, you should focus on stability to attract
                 investments . Wait until 2011 before changes are considered.

                        The economics of business investment are more important than government take and responding to corruption.

                        I applaud the administration's efforts to beef up the auditing.

                  §     Although the PPT and aggregation did not put Alaska in the category of a banana republic, another significant change
                 would do so-especially for political purposes. It was 16 years since the previous major change. Wait until 2011.You don't
                 have any good information yet upon which to make a dramatic change that will last for another 15 years.
