         The only word I have is that Ramras is an automatic "no" on aces because he claims we
         snubbed him on the Ethics Bill signing ceremony (even tho I thanked legislators and
         specifically called Ramras up to the podium to speak at the press conference on it...) He
         told Balash he's still ticked and will pro-actively campaign against aces. I told Joe the
         ceremony was set up by Bitney, it's a shame that the kudos we gave Ramras that day wasn't
         good enough - and he should take it up with Bitney if he's still so bitter about "who got
         to speak first" or whatever the issue was.




         I'll do all I can in reaching out to leggies on this.

         Thanks - and I'm going to get on communications folks for not letting me know where we're
         going with the outreach to leggies. Not good for me not to know.

          Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES. Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
         Majority going to ask for a similar briefing. If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
         deafening , Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.



           Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
         "details" of ACES before going all in.
