            Sarah,



              I saw you on the Glenn Beck program and it's so refreshing to see someone in the
            government talking common sense.  Please continue to do so and congratulations on your
            beautiful new baby boy. I love his name and know he is a blessing to your family each
            day.



            Sincerely,




           Anita Ray
