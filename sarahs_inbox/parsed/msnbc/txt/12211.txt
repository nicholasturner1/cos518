              I haven ' t heard from his staff - unless they 've called and the message hasn ' t gotten to
              me. But I do meet with him for a bit tomorrow morning here in Juneau. And it'll be
              interesting to hear what he says to leggies in tomorrow ' s (?) legislative update. Our DC
              office has encouraged his staff to keep him fully informed on AGIA so he doesn ' t go on a
              rampage based on misinformation.



             Had a good mtg with Shell CEO this evening . They're excited to be in Ak . They hit arctic
             villages this week , the CEO and his wife.
