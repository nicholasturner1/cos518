         The other consideration is revisiting the adopted PPT rate, of couse. And I'm sure you're
         discussing that internally also. it will be helpful to start getting a read on lawmakers'
         intention: revisit PPT with an intended outcome of changing the rate? Or scrapping it and
         taxing on gross?

         Alaska Day is October 18, 2007. Sounds like a grand day to fix a problem that must be
         addressed sooner rather than. later.



         The ideas expressed in your email reflect the promises I have made since even before
         kicking off my campaign on October 18, 2005.



         Look forward to hearing more .         So far,    sounds great . Thank you sincerely.
