             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,



            I really admire the work you've done for Alaska. The state needs someone like you with
            your vision.  Also, with your family being involved in fishing you know how important the
            environment and responsible hunting and fishing are.  Too bad you can't come to Maryland
            and be Governor. We need someone like you!




            I'd love to get an autographed picture if possible. I've been collecting pictures of
            people I admire for years and now that I've got a small daughter (Katya, she's almost 4.)I
                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0010262

              think it's all the more important I add more women I admire for their work to my
              collection so they can serve as role models for her.



              Keep up the good work and God bless.



              Sincerely,
