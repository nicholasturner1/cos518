          Subject:                 Bill Signing SB265 - Sen. McGuire


          Governor -




          Apparently Senator McGuire will be flying out of JNU tomorrow, Friday early morning flight
          and therefore would not be available for the Bill Signing SB265 - Criminal Omnibus at that
          time.




          The Senator is available today and we could add to calendar for 11:30 a.m. this morning if
          you are available at that time. Thanks, Janice
