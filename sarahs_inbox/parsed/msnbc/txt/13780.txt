            Anna has Denali Boro folks' info re: their desire to participate in statehood celebration.
            Nenana is site of Golden Spike w/the railroad construction, and of course the home of Jack
            Coghill. I told them we'd touch base - they have an end-of-July bluegrass celebration they
            could title "Statehood..." something, plus they may have other ideas on how they could be
            included. very nice people, very supportive of us via their Mayor and local elected
            officials (from Healy, Cantwell, Paxson, Nenana, etc).
