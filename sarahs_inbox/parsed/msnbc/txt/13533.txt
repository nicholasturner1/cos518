                Dear Governor Palin,

                      Former AG Havelock sent me the attached letter. So, I had lunch with him today. He
                reiterated his points in person and I listened . I do not confirm or deny what we are or
                are not doing to him and he respects my silence on internal matters . In any event, I pass
                his thoughts on to you, I think you have been doing most of what he suggests - it is
                interesting how he perceives things.

                        Have a nice weekend in the snow.

                        Talis

                              Dear Trais,

                              I know that you'And the gone or have access to far more information than I do on this
                              issue, so jam reluctant to offer my two, cents worth; but Ilats issue has been bothering me
                              for a couple of days and I thought it might be useful for you too hear a perspective "from
                              the st,,' as it we

                              The< r+ecetat aria©t5ac t¢nt t joint declaration by 13P,an : cotrrinco,, that tile. were going
                              to build the gas, pipeline added little to Cominco's previous press release on t topic
                              e ce pl tRat - F, r    t av on boar& Most of us reading the sma0`prmt c iaJd see that. the
                              commitment was otlly a commitment to do; what BP and; Cbmiuoo felt they wanted to do
                              ftom time to tithe.

                              Thus many of us read, the announcement as a power play, intended to detract from the.
                              Governor's plans toproceed with a special session. It was a' statement' that, 'what ver
                              the Governor says or does, we are in charge."

                              -Reading this I asked myself, "What would Egan have done?" Most likely he would have
                              publicly invited the presidents of the two companies to meet with him in Juneau, along
                              with the president of the Trans-Canada Pipeline Company, and maybe Exxon as well.

                              The reason for this call is that all parties seem to concede that no pipeline is going to go
                              without some·level,of cooperation among all these major players. The questions that the
                              governor wants to have answered include - Why don't we have this cooperation now?
                              How can the' state mediate this process and speed it up? The state's interest and the
                              national' interest are that this pipeline be built as speedily as is safely possible. Lack of
                              cooperation, for which there are ' many' symptoms at thus time, may well hold up the
                              construction of the line.

                              There is a subtext here that could .l more :importantz ,that:is, "No, Coroinco and 1W are
                              not in charge . The Governor of the State .of Alaska is in charge."
