        My son's teacher said their 5th grade class almost unanimously chose the grizzly and that
        she reported that information to the commission. My question is, who would that be? Can
        teachers call the information is? And are all 25 students being counted individually, or
        just as 1?

       Not necessarily. And our polling process isn't scientific. And I've been asking school
       students to give me their input which doesn't nec correspond with the email entries on the
       state website.

       Do we have to go with the musher?

       The musher is in the lead by at least 1,000 votes. This also tracks with

       ADN's poll.      We are not telling anyone. Meg & Sharon have a great unveiling

       strategy so we don't want this leaked out.



       The event is scheduled at the Alaska Mint. They are extremely excited.



       Sharon had a great thought on involving the kids with the actual release of

       the quarter in the Fall... inviting all schools to participate.           Also, I know

       Sharon is pulling out comments from students for the press conference.

       If anyone has a rough idea on how the coin design vote is going please let

       me know. Also if we don't already have a place to unveil the coin selection

       it would be great to do this with a bunch of kids around. I could easily do

       this with my brother's fifth grade classroom at Gladys Wood Elem. Outdoors

       unveiling the design, short and sweet announcement with a very large poster

       of the chosen selection would be ideal. Let me know. Thanks

       Many other schools and or classrooms would accomodate this too.
