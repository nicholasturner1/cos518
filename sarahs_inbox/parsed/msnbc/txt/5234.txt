                  Drue liked the first version - so I know she'll have no problem with Joe's final version. Her comments are
                  below - you'll appreciate them.

                  Sorry I was away from my blackberry. But tone is perfect and the big E needs a
                  voice like hers willing to take them on.
                  They want to operate the gas pipeline; don't know if she knows that. I've said
                  I didn't think AK would ever consent. We should talk. Are you comibg to DC?
                  Tell her, "Go, girl!" And to keep telling it like it is. Alaska shouldn't be a
                  captive of Exxon!

                  Drue,

                  What do you think of the attached? The Governor would like to know your thoughts.

                  Thanks,
                  Meghan
