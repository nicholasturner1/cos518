                Subject: In-State Gas concept paper for Monday's Press Conference

                Governor, Kris,
                Here is what I believe to be the "final" concept paper for the "in-State Gas" Conference on Monday. This
                paper has the blessing of both ANGDA and ENSTAR and this is the concept we are all working off. And,
                hopefully, their comments will be pegged off it as well. The following people will be at the press event,
                although other representatives from the entities may show up:

                ENSTAR:
                Gene Dubay , Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems (owner company of ENSTAR)
                Colleen Starring , Regional VP for ENSTAR

                ANGDA:
                Scott Heyworth , Acting Chairman
                Harold Heinze, CEO

                Administration:
                Tom Irwin, DNR
                Pat Galvin, DOR
                Joe Balash , Gov's Ofc
                Marcia Davis, DOR
                Marty Rutherford, DNR

                I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for 1 :00pm on Monday , July 7th, in your
                Anchorage Conference Room . They have also been advised that you will be announcing this formation of
                a project development venture (a public/private partnership) and will be laying out the concept, followed
                by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and Harold Heinze making brief statements . I have asked everyone to
                be at your offices about 15 minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into the Conference Room
                together.

                I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you, Governor. Should you wish anything
                else, please let me know. My cell phone # 317-4728.

               Also, we have identified a series of people to pre-message this announcement to and we will be making those
               calls on Sunday evening and early Monday.

               Thanks for all your support , Governor, and for your recognition that dealing with in-state gas needs is critical! It
               was a great insight that I believe will push the AGIA License over the edge!
