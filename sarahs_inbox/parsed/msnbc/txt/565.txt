   Subject : First Lady Maria Shriver's invitation to attend 2007 California Governor and 1st Lady's Conference on
             Women 10/23
  Hi Todd,

  This is your last opportunity to go to the First Lady's Conference on Women hosted by 1st Lady Maria
  Shrived! The deadline to register is July 9th. I asked Governor Schwarzenegger's scheduler about the
  conference when I was at the NGA Seminar she said it's mostly all women, but she said men do attend
  the meetings and of course Governor Schwarzenegger will be there. Here's a copy of the email that First
  Lady Maria Shriver's assistant sent me along with the website address.

  I didn't think you wanted to attend, but just in case you've changed your mind. :)

  First of all, thank you to everyone who has responded to California First Lady Maria Shriver's invitation to

  Conference will take place on Tuesday, October 23, 2007 in Long Beach, California
  (www.californiawomen.org). We will be closing our VIP registration on Monday, July 9, 2007 and would
  so appreciate hearing back from you. Thank you again for your consideration and please call should you
  have any additional questions.

  All the best from California - Trish Fontana
