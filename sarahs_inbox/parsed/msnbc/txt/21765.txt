               The house has the bill on the floor schedule tonight. However, that will be subject to
               the pace of the finance committee work this afternoon. Its possible the committee will
               drag on into the night.



               In either case , any floor action tonight will be procedural only. It is most likely that
               any amendments or votes would take place Sunday.

               I'm hearing the bill may actually get to the floor tonight? Should I try to get back there
               asap?
