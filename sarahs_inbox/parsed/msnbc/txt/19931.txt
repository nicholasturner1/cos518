                Looks great, if there's a way to hammer home 2000-acre footprint, please do.

               Subject: ANWR Op-Ed

                Governor,

               Attached is the op-ed that Kurt and I would like to submit to The Washington DC Examiner tomorrow. It is
               scheduled to run on Thursday opposite the Sierra Club.

               Below is what the editors would like to see.

               Unless we hear otherwise, we will submit this tomorrow by noon.

               Thanks,
               Meg


               We are delighted that Gov. Palin will do a Pro/Con oped for us on the topic: Should we drill in ANWR? Somebody
               from the Sierra Club (not sure who yet) will argue no, and the governor will take the yes position. The opeds will
               run in the San Francisco and Baltimore Examiners and appear on our website as well.

               We'll need 600 words by July 29 for publication on July 31, and a recent photo of the governor. Please email me
               your address so I can send a tearsheet.
