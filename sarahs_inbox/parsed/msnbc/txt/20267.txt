          Subject:                 September


          Needs to be "Conservation Month" (call it "September Savings" or something you clever
          people come up with) where we kick off a big public effort to conserve... using Juneau as
          that example of how it IS possible to save energy. Included in our efforts will be the
          conservation-measures card to be attached to energy rebate checks.

             Let me know how this will be rolled out with a rah-rah Alaskana community effort that
          shows public unity with this mission. Thanks

            (Kris- pls forwarded to Dan Fauske, he can help with this... then pls let me know who'll
          lead this charge)
