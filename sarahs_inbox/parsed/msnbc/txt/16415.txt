              You bet. And we'll make it much better -- this just gives us something to start with.
              Fagan's out of control.

              I told Rosanne that I'll look at this and we'll need to do some fact checking tomorrow. I
              really appreciate her getting right on this with us!

            Governor , here is my op-ed for Kris' signature . I've sent it around to

            others for their feedback, so there will likely be changes. Just wanted

            you to see what I've got so far.
