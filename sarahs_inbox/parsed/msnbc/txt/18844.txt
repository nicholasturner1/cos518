              Still trying to sit down with it- I have to today in between mtgs.

              Pls be thinking how to message back to Hollis who is insisting he knows there is internal dissent on ACES. Part of
              the response is: he needs to provide specifics as his allegations are political and unfair unless he names names so I
              can deal with this issue - if there is an issue. If there isnt he needs to quit stirring up doubts and just deal with ACES
              on its merits. There is no gag order and I hope staff will publicly debate this.

              I hate the politics in this, as ACES is too imp to be messing around with and I don't want anyone holding back if
              they have disagreements with the proposal.

              But please dont let anyone talk you into just letting this slide, and go unanswered. We do too much of that and then
              we have to "react" aggressively and try to unring a bell that critics have rung. Let's get on top of this one and I've
              asked Russ to call Hollis this morning, but Hollis has been so public about this the past few days we owe it to the
              public to answer Hollis' accusations.

              Did you want any changes to the speech?
