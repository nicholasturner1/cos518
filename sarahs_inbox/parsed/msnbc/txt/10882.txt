             A Servant Air flight carrying 10 people crashed about 100 yards from the Kodiak airport
            just before 2 p . m. today , according to Alaska State Troopers and the U.S. Coast
            Guard ." There are four people in stable condition , the other six conditions , I am unaware
            of," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane.



             In a voice mail, Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said little was known about the crash
            Saturday afternoon, but that some passengers had been killed.



             According to the Coast Guard, a Trident Seafoods floatplane recovered four of the
            passengers , while a Coast Guard helicopter recovered another.



             Those passengers were taken to Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center.



             "The remaining five are trapped in the fuselage . And as we ' re speaking, the Alaska state
            toopers and the Kodiak police just recovered the remaining five people on board," Lane
            said just before 5 p.m.



             "Originally the plane was submerged , and now that the tide has receded ,         rescue crews were
            able to recover the bodies ," he said a moment later.



             The plane, a Piper Navajo Chieftan , was headed to Homer , he said.
