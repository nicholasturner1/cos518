        We're still looking for something for both Privil and Privileg - and they've both been offered
        a few things and Privile was appointed to Post Secondary Educ Commission -^ was NOT
        gunning for Regents. Don't know who told you what - but my admin team and I know that I
        can't please everyone.

        I've heard through the grape vine (not from Pr1vil that

      Privileged d is disappointed in not getting the call for the

        regent seat.If you have any future plans for her,I

        think you should give her a call to let her know.They

        were both huge supporters from day one,unlike the

        many,who have received opportunity, who became.

        supporters after Aug 22.
