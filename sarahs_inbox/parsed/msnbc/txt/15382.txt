           We receive the extradition packed this morning and reviewed it for

           Governor Palin .     I am sending it to her now. She is in Anchorage and

           should have it tomorrow morning. It should be in the Palmer District

           Attorney's Office the following day.

           Might still be in Seattle . Tomorrow I guess. I guess " when it absolutely
