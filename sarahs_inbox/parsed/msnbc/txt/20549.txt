            Governor,



            we have all three bills being goldstreaked from our Juneau ofc to Anchorage. Tara is
            picking them up this morning for us. All should be good.



            Your press folks were given this update yesterday so they could plan your signing events.



            Kelly

           Can't answer those questions- I'll ask kelly and bill and others who were told it's a done
           deal.

           I see the article this morning about PFD payments going out on September 12. Do we have
           legislation back from the legislature to make that deadline? Have we told the press that
           we need . the engrossed bill sent to us by a certain date in order to make that payment?
