           Dear Governor Palin,

                                Hello!  I am the NRA Field Representative for Alaska and I am writing
           you today with an invitation for you and your family to attend our Ketchikan Friends of
           NRA Banquet on 12 Apr 2008. The NRA Executive Director of General Operations, Mr. Kayne
           Robinson, is flying in from HQ to attend the banquet a well. He is coming all that way
           just to congratulate the Ketchikan FNRA Committee on what an AWESOME JOB they have done in
           raising funds to promote the shooting sports.




           If you can make time we would love to have you there as well! We know you have always
           been a HUGE supporter of the shooting sports and we would love to have you attend our
           banquet and have a little fun!



           We look forward to hearing from you.



           Sincerely,

           Brad Kruger
