                  Subject: Special Session Strategy

                Governor,

                Mike asked for an outline of the current thinking related to the special session.
                Attached is an outline of issues associated with getting the needed votes . It was put
                together by Joe with input from Kelly. Also attached is the current schedule for the
                session. The legislature is planning on hitting the road on June 11 and going to
                Fairbanks first. We are circulating an alternative work plan for those legislators
                willing to stick in Juneau.

                Let us know if you have any questions, or would like a more thorough briefing.

                -Pat
