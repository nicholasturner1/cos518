               Also, when interviewing Morgan Christian for Supreme Court, she mentioned he is the reason
               she ended up staying in Alaska for her career, if anyone wanted to incorporate her in the
               presser.

               Oh shoot! That is sad - and you're right I was referring to him also wth ADN. He kept.
               inviting me and my family to go to dinner... I thought we'd really be burdening him, even
               if we had him over here , so I kept putting it off and putting it off. Shoot- another
               lesson learned and I could kick myself for not.



              Yes- we need a presser on this. He was so sweet and wise and every time I spoke to him he
              was a wonderful counselor. We lost a wealth of Alaskan knowledge last night, but can
              forever hold on to his Alaskan spirit and his guidance for the future if we abide by the
              constitution he helped create.

               I just received a message from Justice Carpeneti that Tom Stuart passed away tonight at
               Bartlett Hospital.  I think he was 88 years old. It made me think of the comment you made
               the other day to the ADN Editorial Board about how young Alaska is and how lucky we are to
               be able to talk to those that were part of the constitutional convention. We lost another
               historic figure tonight.



               I can work with Beth and Sharon in the morning to get additional information and prepare a
               statement for you.



               Mike

               These sure do make sense, so let's do them. And I'm trusting this is a two-way deal...
               that they don't say one thing to us, then something else to others - I've heard that's
               been the case occassionally but trust those aren't accurate reports. I do hope they also
               have a desire to have better communications so our residents are served to the best of all
               our abilities. Whatever we can do, we'll do. Thanks for thinking and working on this
               issue.



               Haven't heard back on my suggestion for joint pressers on Exxon case... surely there are
               other potential joint efforts out there like polar bear listing concerns, District of
               Columbia handgun ban in front of Supreme Court, etc.
