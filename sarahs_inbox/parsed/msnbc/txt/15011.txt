            I hadn't even noticed the bill prior to this but I just read it and have two

            Sheeesh- he did some injustice in reporting on the "pay raise bill" that was

            signed into law.., his account of the issue in today's Empire is certainly

           not the way I read the issue. I don't support raises for legislators or the

           Gov's or LtGov's positions... if I missed something with the bill that

            Forgey claims I "quitely signed into law" (intimating there's something

           sinister about the issue ), then I got snookered into something perhaps we

           should have spoken up against . Perhaps this one should have become law

           without my signature?
