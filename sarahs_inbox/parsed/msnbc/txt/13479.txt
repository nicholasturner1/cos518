            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,

           Greeting from Georgia. I just read the story of the birth of your 5th child.
           Congratulations!  You and your family have just been blessed like you could never believe.
           My youngest daughter just turned 7. She was born pre-maturely, 3 holes in her heart, and
           oh yes, with Down Syndrome. After a rough first year with the heart surgeries, Kristen
           has been such an incredible joy. My Mom said it best, I couldn't imagine our life with
           someone with Down Syndrome, now that we have Kristen, I can't imagine our life without
           her.  I'm sure Alaska has all the early intervention programs like the ones we got
           involved with, that is key. We had Kristen in OT, PT, still in Speech therapy at age 7.
           I know you are a busy Governor and over 3000 miles away and have 100s of people contacting
           you, feel free to use me and my wife and family as your long distance pen/email pals. God
           led me to your website to contact you. You and your entire family will be in our prayers.
           Believe me - get ready to sm

            ile and laugh like you never have before...I can't believe it's been 7 years for us!

           Brad and Heidi Holland.. Lauren & "Kristen"
