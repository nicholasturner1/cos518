                     Juneau, AK 99811

                     Dear Governor Pal in,

                     The City of False Pass and its residents would like you to know how important the
                     Design and Construction of Water and Sewer Facilities funding in the state budget is to
                     us. The community homes and other buildings are presently on individual septic
                     systems. Because the septic systems are quite old, 28 of the existing 32 systems have
                     failed or are failing to the point of ponding or accumulation of sewage on the ground.
                     This is a serious health concern to residents and one we are anxious to remedy.

                     We are about to the 85% design phase of a new community -wide sewer system. With
                     continued funding from the State of Alaska and the matching federal funds , we hope to
                     move to construction late this summer or early next spring.

                     As we have been working with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium but
                     successfully managing the construction of the water system improvements (completed)
                     and wastewater design project ourselves , we know that this project is being done as
                     efficiently as possible. It is a good project that brings health benefits and economic
                     development to False Pass. We hope that it will not be a veto target in the FY 09
                     Capital Budget.

                     Sincerely,


                     Tom Hoblet

                   PO Box 110001
                   Juneau AK 99811-0001


                   Dear Governor Palin,

                   We would like to thank you and the legislators for recognizing our community ' s need and for adding
                   $4,000,000 to the FY 09 Capital Budget to improve the runway in Chignik Lagoon.

                   As shown on the map, our gravel runway runs through the middle of a subdivision within our village.
                   The approach is at an incline and the runway ends with at a cliff that drops down to the water. In
                   addition, if a resident is crossing the runway as an airplane makes their approach , the plane must pull
                   up.

                   The 1800 foot runway is a serious health hazard because it barely accommodates a Caravan and the
                   Navajo is not permitted to land there . This makes us at a serious disadvantage during medical
                   emergencies. There are times when we do not get a plane for more than three days at a time due to
                   weather. The length of our runway in addition to the weather is not a good combination for safety.
                   Please see the enclosed letter from a resident who had an appendicitis emergency in the middle of the
                   night. She was fortunate, and we hope to never have an unfortunate incident.

                   The $4 million dollars will be used to extend the runway at least another 400 feet . The side roads will
                   also be improved and a light system added to alert the citizens on the ground of the approaching
                   aircraft. This will be safer for the residents and for the pilots.

                   In 2003 the village spent $50,000 to $75,000 and lengthened the runway from 1600 to 1800 feet on our
                   own. We have also improved the side roads and done all that we can to improve the safety and quality
                   of life for our citizens. This funding will complete the improvements.

                   This is a public safety project that will benefit our residents and visitors to our community. Not only will
                   those entering and leaving the village be safer, but our residents will be assured access to health
                   facilities, and the protection of our children will be enhanced. We appreciate your support of Chignik
                   Lagoon.

                   Sincerely,

                       Attn: Rodney Anderson
                       Dillingham , AK 99576

                       Dear Mr Anderson:
                                My name is Delissa Jones and I am a resident of the Bristol Bay Area . I reside in Chignik
                       Lagoon.
                       Last month a medivac plane was called to my assistance to get me to the nearest hospital for a
                       medical emergency . The medivac was ordered at approximately 3:50AM but I did not get picked
                       up until 12:30PM . I was in acute and excruciating pain that the strongest pain medication at our
                       local clinic just barely took the edge off. When I finally did reach Anchorage at 4:30PM, I was
                       diagnosed with ruptured appendix and went into surgery immediately.
                                 My concern Is the amount of time that it took for my medivac plane to reach me. I realize
                       that our airfield limits the type of aircrafts that can land and take off but it still took over 8 hours for
                       the plane to get here. Each resident in Bristol Bay should be taken care of and every possible
                       action should be taken to assure their health and safety . I want every person to feel safe and
                       secure living in our community . I ask that anything and everything that you can do to improve the
                       medivac system will be done for future emergencies.

                                Sincerely,


                                Delissa Jones
