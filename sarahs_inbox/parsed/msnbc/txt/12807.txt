           Hi Governor Palin,

               I am a professor at the University of Southern Mississippi in the field of
           International Relations. I feel that beacuse of your true conservative values you would be
           an excellent choice to run with Senator McCain as his Vice President.

                 Regards,

                        Robert Jordan
