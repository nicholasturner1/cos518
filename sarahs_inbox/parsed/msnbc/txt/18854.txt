          Bert says HORRIBLE communications skills from our office on this - he said the bomb was
          dropped on him just this morning... I asked him if he knew of Leo's speech

         Mike's about to send his best take on it. About the best gov can do is listen and give
         him the opportunity to express his view on this project he's worked hard for over the
         years.  What can't be lost in all this is that many good folks in KTN were genuinely
         jerked around with false hopes and political posturing. FHM could have let them down easy
         but didn't have the stomach for it.




          Some politicos are going to have to show extreme outrage over the course of the next week
         or so, in order to save face and we'll have to weather the storm without lashing out.

         Okay thanks for the update Russ .           Just keeping the Gov in the loop on this. I believe
        she just left a mssg for Steadman.

           At this point, Randy has called and left a message for the mayor. "We have returned the
          mayor's call but had to leave a message."
