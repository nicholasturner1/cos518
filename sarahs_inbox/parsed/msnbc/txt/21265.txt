               Governor,




               In case you have not heard, the General Government Unit (GGU) which is the State's largest
               employee union voted to ratify the state's contract.  Assuming the Legislature approves
               the monetary terms, the employees will be covered under a three year contract. This is
               good news.  We still have fiscal year 2008 issues to resolve with the supervisors' union
                                                                       1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0006637
