             MESSAGE:

             Dear Govenor Palin,

             Congratulations on the birth of Trig! Our son John is 9 years old, and has Down Syndrome.
             My other children say he is the light of our lives! You have so much fun ahead! Things
             will all come to him in time. Don't worry, just enjoy. Keep up your hard work for the
             State of Alaska, it's our favorite vacation spot in the world.
