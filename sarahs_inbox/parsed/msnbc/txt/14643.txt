              Joe- So how does this work with Ralph Samuels spending three days with FERC in DC
             recently? Any influence there?

             Sorry, I dont know what its about. I suspect it is one of two things, though. Either an
            announcement that they are filing paperwork with FERC under the pre-application process or
            that Enbridge is joining the Denali group.
