            Subject: SB 202 Information




            NOTE:      this letter will NOT be public until tomorrow.



            Attached is the letter Governor Palin signed today allowing SB 202

            become law without signature.        As I explained it to the sponsor's staff

            (George in Sen. Wielechowski's office), it provided a way for the

            Governor to make a statement and agree with the sponsor of the bill and

            still expand on additional concerns in the areas of privacy, the federal

            government forcing state's action and Alaskan's ability to oversee its

            own identification system.



            It is important to say the Governor agrees with Sen Wielechowski

            approach with SB 202; however the overall issue of REAL ID is still

           unresolved.



            In my opinion, this should be shared in a positive manner -- Alaskans

           are concerned about personal privacy and the Governor's agrees.



           Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks so much.

                                                                  1
