Subject: AGIA op ed published?
Meg/Bruce:

Did my AGIA op ed go out last night? Has anyone let you know when it would be published?

Bruce in answer to your question about pr strategy on AGIA, please coordinate with Meg and
her team and keep me in the loop on progress.

The more information the better - and the sooner the better - the Legislators and many in the
public are really thristing for more information. And some are getting quite impatient, no fault of
anyone's... it's just human nature to want more information, and I agree with them that the
gasline is the most important work we're engaged in right now - they want to know of the
project's progress ASAP.

thanks!
