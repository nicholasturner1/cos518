             We are so proud of you. All of Alaska is so proud of you. You hit that speech out of the ballpark - with only one
             hour to rehearse it? It was surreal for us as your staff to watch you on TV on stage with Sen . McCain ... like an
             out of body experience. We were in tears. God bless.
