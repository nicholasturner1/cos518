             Dear Sarah,



             I am sure you have heard about MAST discontinuing service in Alaska. I am very concerned.
             I am an $MTII in Anderson, we use MAST about twice a year to medevac patients out of
             rugged, wet, frozen or otherwise rough terrain. We will often travel to the patient on
             ATV's or snowmachines then call MAST to pick them up so the ride out to the highway does
             not further injure them. Please see what you can do to change the Army's mind on this. I
             have no doubt that without this service, Alaskans will perish.



             Thanks,

             Karen
