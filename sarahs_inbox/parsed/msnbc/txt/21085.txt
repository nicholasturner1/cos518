            Governor,

            Sandy and I want to invite you and Todd to join us for dinner in our home sometime across the
            next couple of weeks . I'd like the chance for the four of us to think together on Alaska 's future,
            if possible . It would be a simple , informal meal and I'd email Todd to ask him , as well, but don't
            have his address in my contacts . Perhaps you could forward to him.

            We now live close to Jewel Lake Rd. and Raspberry so we're close to the airport if needed. Let
            me know if I can get in touch with Janice to work on scheduling. Thank you so much.

            Sean
