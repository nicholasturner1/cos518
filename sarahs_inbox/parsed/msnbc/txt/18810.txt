        At least someone should ask him where's he getting those numbers, on the air... That holds
        him a wee bit accountable anyway.

        Called Kristan and Ralph, neither one of them know where that number is

        coming from.      The financials are not completed yet. Can't reach Joe,

        but I've left him messages. I'll work with Kristan on countering

        this ...asap.

        Now Rydell's touting "MatMaid is losing $26,000 a day". If that's true,

        we stop the bleeding asap and give an explanation to Alaskans, if NOT

        true we counter it asap and call him and AH on their bull.
