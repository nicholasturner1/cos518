            MESSAGE:

            I read your story today about your new baby (online article). I was touched that you
            didn't abort this beautiful baby after you found out that you were having a baby with
            downs.  So many times we "talk the talk but-don't walk the walk", but your actions
            definitely reflect what you say. I don't know anything about your politics or you as an
            individual but I wanted to wish you and your family the best with your new little one.
            Congratulations!
