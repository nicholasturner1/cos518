         I would still really like any opportunity to incorporate aces messaging in this trip- we
         will be criticized for canceling. Dont want to step on their ak day agenda (and I'd rather
         do theie "fun" agenda items while there!) but anyway to kill two birds, i want to do it.

          Subject: Sitka ACES briefing



          Governor:




          We'll be working on your schedule for Sitka this afternoon and Monday.



          I need your preference on going forward with the ACES briefing in Sitka.




          We planned the briefing so you would be present.



         But we've received considerable feedback from the community that it's too much to add to
         their scheduled celebration of Alaska Day on the 18th.




         When we discussed briefly in NY, you indicated you were committed to Sitka, whether or not
         we had the briefing that day.
