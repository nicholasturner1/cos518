            Kelly- I still haven't heard back from lyda on abortion bills. What did any of our
            friendly leggies say about their desire to see the bills addressed in a second sp session
            perhaps?

             Governor - We have been working individually with every legislative office getting their
            recommendations/priorities.   I believe Sheila was following up on the interaction between
            you and Senator Wilken near the end of session to talk about the budget. Unfortunately,
            Senator Wilken had very limited time available in May to meet with you before the bill
            deadline so I responded to Sheila to let her know that would be difficult to accommodate.
            I don't believe anyone has taken offense.



             We did not offer to arrange individual meetings - with lawmakers and you - given the very
            limited time available. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
            Privileged or Personal Material


             Many lawmakers have written letters urging your support for their projects and provided
            OMB with comments / backup, etc... I don ' t think any of them can accuse us of not
            communicating with them and the legislature certainly didn't give us much time to review
            given the early transmittal of the bill.     Kelly may have some thoughts on the request from
            Sen. Therriault for a meeting.



             We are also responding to hundreds of emails and letters from individuals, groups,
            communities all over the state seeking your support for these projects! Karen

            I can't tick off these leggies who are offering to help with budget - and don't want to
           be accused of refusing to see them , so let Gene know of my available times and we'll chat
           with him. I don' t know how the msg was given to Gary - or how it was received - but I want
           to make sure there's no perception of "she won't see us " from leggies.

            Governor - I just received a telephone call from Senator Therriaults' office. Senator
           Therriault is in ANC on Wed. 05.14 (afternoon) and Thur. 05.15.08. The Senator is
           requesting to meet with you in regards to Capital Budget. Per your direction last week on
           the Wilken request - I regretted and asked if they would like to send something in
           writing.  They then contacted Karen as you can see by her response below.   Please let me
           know how you would like me to follow up with Senator Therriaults request.



             Thanks, Janice

            Thanks Sheila - it is a HUGE job! We are working hard going through every project, all
           the backup, working with departments, legislators, communities, and trying to come up with
           recommendations for the governor.  As you know, the governor has until May 23 to take
           action on the capital budget. I am planning on heading back up to Anchorage next week and
           the following week to work with the governor on the budget. Unfortunately, the dates that
           Senator Wilken is available and not very good for where we are /need to be in the process!
            I know that Mindy let the governor's office know about the interaction between the
           Governor and the Senator, but I think it will be very difficult to actually get something
           scheduled under the circumstances.



            You probably already received a call from one of the OMB budget analysts on projects
           specific to your district. If you, or Gary, have any specific recommendations to share on
           other items, I would appreciate it very much! We are going to try to do the best job we
           can in the very short period of time we have to do it in! Thanks! KJR

            Hi Karen,



            Good luck with the huge task that is before you - analyzing the largest ever capital
           budget.  If anyone can do this massive job, it is you. I wish you the best.



            I mentioned to Mindy Rowland a couple of days ago that Governor Palni stopped by to visit
           Gary, along with Todd, a week or so before the end of session . At this meeting Gov Palin
           indicated that she would like to meet with Gary and other members of the Senate minority
           when the capital budget was finalized to get their perspective on the merits of the some
           of the projects.



            I can only imagine how busy Gov Palin ' s life must be with the birth of Trig, but if she
           still would like to meet- or if you would like to meet - with Gary and others, I thought
           it might be helpful for you to know Gary's prior commitments for the next couple of weeks.



            Gary and his wife Sue plan to attend an out - of-state wedding of a close friend's son and
           will be gone from Alaska May 14-20 with an important local Fairbanks event on tMay 21.



            Right now Gary is hauling his boat to Valdez and plans to return to Fairbanks on May 9.
           Therefore , as far as Gary ' s personal schedule goes the following dates would work for him,

                                                            4




                                                                                                         PRA GSP01_0017380

           if the governor or you would like to visit re: capital budget.



            May 10 - 13

            May 22 - 23



            Once again , good luck.      Please let me know if I can help in any way.
