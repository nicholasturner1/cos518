            Huggins unwillingness to work with us on anything and everything makes me very un-enthused
            about meeting with him last-minute on his priorities.

            Yes I've spoken with his staffer twice today and told her in the last call that I'd stop
            by in the morning. Huggins has concerns over Brenda Rebne of Ahtna, the nominee for the
            Big Game Commercial Services Board. I'm hopping on my flight here but plan to see Huggins
            personally in the morning. I told Janice that I"d report back if he still needed to see
            you.



            Concern is over Brenda's closeness to Ahtna (which she works for) and whether she'll be
            able to represent other Large Private Land Owners. Brenda has said she would, but
            something in the way she answered the question in Friday's confirmation hearing raised the
            concern from both Huggins and Wagoner (whom I have a call into as well).



            FYI also, Brenda comes to town Wednesday and will make rounds to Leg's.
