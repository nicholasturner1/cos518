               Heads up for the Gov-

               During the reception at the residence tomorrow night with the Commission on Aging, the
               folks want the Gov's support for their existing program FACES=Family and Community Elder
               Supports $1.5 million in operating and $2 million in capital for home and community based
               grant services for older Alaskans. If not in her budget amendments, would she be willing to
               quietly behind the scenes lend support in their legislative efforts.
