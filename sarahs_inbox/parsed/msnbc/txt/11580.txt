              I'll get these to you and I'll        see if we can tell who forwarded to Maher. This incident
              exposed the fact that we don't        retain content long enough to easily get these kinds of
              answers . The new ETS Director        and I discussed how to resolve this and he will be getting
              back to me after he talks with        the Microsoft Exchange staff in ANC.

               Annette- I didn't grab the backup documents from you re: the recepient list of the email
              that got leaked. Pls leave those with me - and please follow up on who sent the email to
              Maher. He wasn 't on Sunny's distribution list, correct?
