            Studded tire tax is scheduled for Sunday!



            I'll get Russ a hearing request-hopefully he has the back-up that                         Suzanne is requesting.

           We do need the back up information for it. He threw it on Sunday's calendar and that is
           when we realized that we didn't even have a hearing request for it. Anything you all can
           get us would be good!

           Thanks!

           Suzanne

           Suzanne,




           Thanks for the email. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Rep Meyer-he's one of my
           favorites.  I wouldn't reference his name without first talking to him about it.



           Would Rep Meyer hear HB 106 if he received a hearing request?

           Ivy,

           Thanks for the phone call yesterday. We appreciate it. The funny thing is, I went back
           and looked at hearing requests that I have received, and we haven't even received a
           hearing request from the administration for HB 106.



           Suzanne
