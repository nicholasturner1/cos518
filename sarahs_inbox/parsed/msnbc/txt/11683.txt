             Hate to bug u Kris, or anyone else: but do u remember we did the letters of
             recommendations for Britta Hanson? Her mom needs more copies of it, I can sign new copies.
             If we don't have it anymore , can someone print off a few copies of Elle Fuller's letter of
             reco , replacing Britta ' s name in it ? She needs it for college scholarship apps . Thank you!
