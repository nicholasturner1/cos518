        Sounds good. We've been meaning to ask you and Todd for some time. I know your schedule is
        hectic and fluid so we'll work with you guys to accommodate. Also, if you're schedules
        require a different time of day (during school hours or before flights??) we can be
        flexible with our timing.  We'll wait to hear back.. .thanks.

       Governor,



       Sandy and I want to invite you and Todd to join us for dinner in our home sometime across
       the next couple of weeks. I'd like the chance for the four of us to think together on
       Alaska's future, if possible. It would be a simple, informal meal and I'd email Todd to
                                                            1

        ask him, as well, but don't have his address in my contacts. Perhaps you could forward to
        him.



        We now live close to Jewel Lake Rd. and Raspberry so we're close to the airport if needed.
        Let me know if I can get in touch with Janice to work on scheduling. Thank you so much.
