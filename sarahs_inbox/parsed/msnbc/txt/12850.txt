                I spoke to Denise again and she called Bill McAllister and she also spoke wlGinger in Green 's office . I called
                Ginger as well and told her that I don 't appreciate Senator Green 's quote in Bill McAllister's blog . It is not true and
                I want a correction . She said that she hasn't read it; she doesn't read blogs . And, I said you might want to read
                this one considering it is Channel 2 News . I read the paragraph to her about the no veto pledge . She went on to
                say that they never said anything about no veto pledges but that the Governor said she would revisit the project.
                But then later said she hasn 't had an opportunity to talk to the Senator since the meeting this morning . I told her
                to read the statement, it is a quote from Senator Green and I don 't appreciate having our names tied to lies. She
                told me she would talk to the Senator and call me back.

               Hello,

               My name is Jon Schoepke, and I am the producer of the Big Wild Radio Show
               www.thebigwid .com. We are an outdoors show based out of Madison , Wisconsin
               that is syndicated on 19 stations throughout 56different states (MN, M, IL, NE, MI, and IA).

               I would like to make an interview request for Sarah Patin.

               The phone interview lasts for 13 minutes and it happens on Fridays from 10 AM
               to 1 PM Central Time.

               We would like to interview Sarah in regards to her fishing experiences ) If she would like to talk about anything else outdoor related as well that would be perfect

               The Big Wild has been in syndication for five years and we pride ourselves
               In being total screw upst Unlike most outdoors shows we are NOT experts, we
               laugh at our short comings . We've had on such guests as Jeff Foxworthy, Ted Nugent, Joe Boucher, Charlie Daniels, Marty Stouffer, and Jim Fowler.

               Please call or email if you happen to be available and if those times don't
               work out, we can always reschedule to fit your needs.

               Thank you for your time and consideration.

               Jon Schoepke
               Producer of The Big Wild
