  Subject : Call from the Governor
  Kris/Mike - I just talked with the Governor regarding her request to come into Juneau on Tuesday
  evening, 07.31 instead of Wednesday morning so that she does not miss the reception at the Mansion.

 I explained that Todd had requested that the Governor take the afternoon flight with Willow to Juneau on
 the afternoon of Wednesday, 08.01 so that she could take Piper to basketball camp. I assured the
 Governor that the afternoon flight would have her arrive here in Juneau in time for the 4:30 p.m.
 reception. The Governor agreed to leaving the flight as arranged on Wednesday, 08.01 (afternoon).
 Thanks, Janice
