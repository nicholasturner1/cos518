               I asked the question for Karen to look up, as you can see there has not been any serious effort to fill
               these vacant trooper positions.

               I tried to call but got your voice mail - here is what I was able to pull quickly - this does not include ALL
               vacant positions in DPS - it is just troopers , corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, majors - and
               these are snapshots in time

               6/30/2008 - 56 vacant
               12/31 /2007 - 58 vacant
               6/30/2007 - 65 vacant

               Bottom line is that it doesn 't appear things have changed much in a year 's time - hope this helps! Randy,
               are you attending the event at the house? KJR
