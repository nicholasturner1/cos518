           We / and they certainly can't set the agenda until we know if the Governor is going to be there.
           The trip will not happen at all without the Governor because the LG was already there and it does
           us little good to send the Cmsr w/o the Governor. However, that being said, the main event would
           be an AGIA town hall meeting. I know that Barrow residents and NS Borough residents would have
           other ideas, too - including a luncheon function, a whaling function (just to snowmachine and see a
           camp or two). It will accomplish, at the very least, an AGIA resolution promoting passage and good
           will among the residents who were very excited the first time around. If the Governor goes, Cmsr.
           Irwin and Joe Balash would go. They are available on these dates - Fairbanks on Thursday and
           Barrow on Friday.

          Before we go forward, the Governor wants to know what the agenda is, who else is going , and what will it
          accomplish for her to go out there? Please advise!

           Can I move forward with the Barrow trip? Did you receive any other feedback to the contrary from
           the Governor?
