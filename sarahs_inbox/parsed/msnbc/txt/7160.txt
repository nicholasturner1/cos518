            Would you approact Karl Clauson about this please? Again, I hate to see what may be coming
            with the criticism of this great church if it's truly being perceived as receiving favors, as some are
            speculating in the public.

              This in response to your query re sportsdome--

              I have stayed out of the discussion since I am a member of ChangePoint (except to clarify that the church
              does not to my knowledge have a financial stake in the dome).

              I think your idea of calling on the private sector is sound--you'll want to think in terms of your criteria for
              the entire capital budget so you make consistent calls like that throughout, however.
