           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,




           First, congratulations on Trig's arrival, he is one lucky guy.




           OK, I live off of Fairview Loop.

           It is.a sad reality that most people in this area,have to get in a car and drive somewhere
           to enjoy the outdoors, or have a safe place for children to play.



           For years, residents have worked hard to get a pedestrian path on Fairview Loop.

           We are in the fastest growing area of the borough, yet there is no safe way for ANYONE to
           get from one street to the next, let alone walk or ride a bike to school.



           We have no shoulders, no cross walk and not one street lamp in front of Snowshoe
           Elementary.



           Yet, we in the fastest growth area in MSB.

           We had been looking into grants when this $22 M appeared on the Go bond. Got excited, then
                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSPO1_0016073

           I heard that

           some would like to make this a truck route to Pt. Mac., I dropped the idea of a safe
           walking, and have

           been trying to find out the truth about plans for out area. Of course I've gotten
           nowhere.



           We have a beautiful growing community here with a lot of history, we need to preserve and
           bring up the standards of

           life here.  We need to get Dad's off the couch and out riding bikes with their children,
           and have a safe place

           for older folks to walk their dogs and listen to the birds.



           Could you please take this into consideration during projects in our area??




           Thank you so much for your time,




           Sabrina Shaw
