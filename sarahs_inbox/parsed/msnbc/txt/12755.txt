            And there were as many repubs as dems at their town hall meeting it was good.

            Sharon, yep- it was our second movie we've seen together in the last four years. After all
            the Iditarod events on Saturday we dropped off Piper at Sarah's sister's house because we
            had two hours before we attended the Spenard town hall meeting (hollis and lyndsey holmes
            and mike doogan invited us) so we went to see Juno. Then we spent and hour and a half with
            the legislators and their consituents at the spenard rec center. I'm glad the ear asked
            about this because Sarah's happy to get to tell her that she and I spent all that time
            with the legislators who invited us to meet at spenard rec. It was great being there.

            A couple of locals tell Ear they went to the movies last Saturday after the Iditarod start
            ceremonies and found themselves standing in line next to Sarah and Todd, who bought
            tickets for Juno (great movie, by the way, if you haven't seen it yet)



            I'm inclined to believe them but . .
