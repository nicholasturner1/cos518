           Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to
           the citizens and get bills introduced in the state legislature in california florida and
           elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they should split the revenue stream
           with a specified amount (maybe half) going to the citizens as a direct benefit

             How much does each alaskan get?

             What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the
            citizens?

             Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?

                                                               2

               Sharon is working with Bill Mcallister on coordinating getting out the statement about the 2007 annual report and
               the other statements from COS Nizich and commissioners. Did you have any edits to my draft statement about
