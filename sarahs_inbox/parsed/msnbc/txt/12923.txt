           I'm in Anchorage on Monday if that's better for them. The closer to plane time on Monday,
           the better.

           Subject : WAIT- ANCSA meeting




           Just spoke with Chair of CEO board, Sheri Buretta. She said Tuesday WAS best, but we
           waited too long, too crunched for them to arrange travel/schedules. She said they now
           prefer first week of April. No hard feelings, she understood this was a busy week, etc.
           Anyway, please let me know when that week we could do it, in Juneau.



            Thanks,

            Bruce

            Hi Janice,



           Just spoke with the Governor, and she is fine with (in fact desires) a meeting next week.
            Tuesday is still best for Tom and me, and for the CEOs I have spoken with. Please let
          me know time ASAP so I can let the CEOs make their travel plans. Thanks!
                                                                 1

           Do me a favor- give McAllister a hard time for this situation: while he's covering that
           boring of budget stuff in Juneau? He missed the fireworks around Southcentral today!



           And I'll call Lay re: budget.
