            That's always the best case, that's for sure. I told him yesterday no interview because we
            hadn't gone through the details. When we spoke again last night he said that he would keep
            it at a high-level regarding the questions below and then if he had specifics, he would ask
            Karen independently. Never hesitate to say - Kyle, we have the Governor here, let's get
            through those questions first. With the last-minute timing and accommodations of working
            through varying schedules, this was the only way to handle it this time.

            Thanks, everyone.

            It went for over 45 minutes and was excruciating. He hadn't spoken with Sabra or anybody else... nor had
            he spent any time in Juneau during this past session , but went on and on at length trying to get us to
            explain the process.

            A suggestion ... budget-related interviews should either talk with OMB or the Legislative Office prior to
            speaking with the Governor so we can get through all the details/numbers/etc. first... and then narrow
            down the time necessary to get comments from the Governor.

            Thanks!
            John

            I just wrote Sharon to see where it is and get it moving. Does 11am work for people -
            shouldn 't be more than 20 minutes. I know the Governor has a noon for police memorial.

             So Kyle is only looking for broad sweeps on capital budget right now - similar to what you said
             during the press conference today . (And I walked through some of those comments - you need to
             get the team together and start working through - that you haven 't seen everything yet - you
             want to look at everything on their merit and see what 's good for the state .) Kyle would like to
             know what your philosophy is? How will you look through the spending lines and projects ? Will you
             take out your veto pen? How about the process itself? The 180- page document is unveiled with a
             couple days to go ( his facts , not mine ), could that truly be enough time for lawmakers to peruse
             and vote on ? Is that process fair?

             He would like to talk to you , Governor - as well as Karen re : capital budget. Karen, he would
             actually like to talk through more specifics with you.

             I'd like to set up for the morning . It could either be together or separate - whatever works best.
             But Kyle knows to keep it high level.

             Thanks,
             Meg
