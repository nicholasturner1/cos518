            Would you like to invite your Cabinet and senior staff to the Prayer Lunch? Shannon from John Bitney's office
            was inquiring if they were expected to attend. I wouldn't think that they're expected to attend, but they are
            invited.
            If you would like to extend a verbal invitation, that would be great. If you'd like for me to email them an invite so
            they have all the information, just let me know.

            Next year, it will be smooth sailing ... as it will all be routine by then.

           Easter
           Would you like for me to pick up baskets for the girls? Stefani has candy, but if you want I could pick something
           else up.
           On-line gift certificates for Old Navy, American Eagle, Abercombie... I'd need credit card info. for that..
           Tanning coupons for Bristol...?
           Movie passes

           No problem using the plc. Erika! And your questions are no bother at all!

           Remind Steph that I boiled all the eggs that I found in the fridge last night - sorry I nabbed them if she needed
           them for anything today.

           Thanks!

           Hello Governor,

           The Governor's Prayer Breakfast (Lunch this year) would like to run a TV. ad for the event. Would it be okay with
           you- to use your official picture? Andy Mills is sending a few other pictures over. The advertisement would
           basically show a few pictures and say something like.."Come join us as we honor, support, and pray for Governor
           Sarah Palin" followed by the information for the event.

           I apologize for bothering you with questions , we just don't want to over-step our bounds or use something that
           we shouldn't.
