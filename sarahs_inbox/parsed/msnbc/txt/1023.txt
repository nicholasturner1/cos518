Yes, they all should be working. To view them you should be able to access them through the icon
on your computer (Pelco). I will follow up as soon as I get to work.

Tom- did the Security alarm ever get re-set after you explained to Todd last week that something was
wrong with it? And the security camera doesn't show on the tv or home computers anymore. I.ask
because it's 1:40am and someone's ringing the doorbell again and I can't see who it is without going
down there (same thing happened Sunday). All is fine, but haven't heard if something happened with
security camera outdoors.
