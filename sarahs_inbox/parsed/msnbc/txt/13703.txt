             Kris:



             A letter from Sen. Kookesh is attached along with a draft response from the Governor. I
             tend to write in "legalese" a bit so feel free to edit.



             When edits are complete, please print and give to the Governor with a copy of his initial
             letter for her review.



             Thanks,



             Randy
