             Governor,

            We won't have the projects start in May and I'll work with Mike Nizich for scheduling.

            Thanks,

             Erika

            Erika:  Special session may be throughout May, so pls don't have water shut off in the
            house during that month. Pls work with Mr. Nizich on timing of the water repair issues,
            thanks.  We should know more on sp sess timing soon.
