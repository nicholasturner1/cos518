  Hi Todd,

  Here's your flight information for tomorrow and your return to Anchorage
  (3/2).  When you check in please check to see if a better seat is available,
  sorry-there were only middle seats left. On your return to Anchorage (3/2),
  the Governor is seated in 14A, so you're in 14B, there are window and aisle
  seats available, but they're in a different row.


  Congratulations again, on winning the Iron Dog!
  Erika
