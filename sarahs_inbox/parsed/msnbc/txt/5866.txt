            Subject: wolf kill language

            i still need the language re: two previous advisory votes that passed, saying "no" to airplane
            shooting of wolves. what were specifics? banning F & G biologists even from using aircraft to
            cull?

            i am still asked why I'm "violating the will of the people" and need that ballot language to futher
            explain my position.
            thanks!
