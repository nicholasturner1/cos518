              Good Afternoon,

              In light of the Governor's recent announcement to address long tens solutions for sustainable energy
              infrastructure, and the completion of a first draft for possible legislation to address this issue, Mayor
              Whitaker would like me to schedule a meeting next week on Tuesday or Wednesday to include
              Speaker Harris, Senate President Green, The Governor, Steve Haagenson, Joe Balash and the
              Mayor to review the draft legislation and discuss the specifics of a 360 degree-win on this issue for the
              upcoming special session.

               Our office will arrange travel once we have solidified a time and location.

               Please do not hesitate to call my cell phone at 907.388.7951 if I can be of further assistance prior to
               meeting.

              Thank you,

              Jennifer
