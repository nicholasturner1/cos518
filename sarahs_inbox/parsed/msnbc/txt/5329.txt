              All,

              Obviously, if the ADN is only willing to print one op-ed piece it

              should be the governor's. Second ,         if they run two then mine should

              follow the governor's.



              Finally, if the ADN doesn 't run mine... let's look to other newspapers

              (Newsminer ,   Frontiersman ,    Clarion) that might carry it. Thanks.



              Sean
