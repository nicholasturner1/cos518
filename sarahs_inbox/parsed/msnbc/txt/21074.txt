          We'll need to do the checking ourselves , but run by Tara Rhonda' s name.



          I have to meet with a few folks this morning who are working on the house, so if you guys
          can contact those few names that'd be great. Let me know if you cant.

        Privileged d
                  . Also I thought about Gloria O'Neil and Ken Johns. I can call Margie. Perhaps
          Tara J. can be trusted to check w/folks?
