                      Habitat Department Transitions from Natural Resources Department

                July 1, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today praised the work of state
                officials in completing the transition of the Habitat Division from the Department of Natural
                Resources (DNR) to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G). The move, initiated
                by Governor PaHn earlier this year in Executive Order 114, reversed a decision by the prior
                administration. After extensive discussions with community leaders and after hearing the
                concerns of numerous Alaskans, the Governor decided that the division belonged in what
                had been its traditional home at ADF&G.

               "I appreciate the cooperation between the two agencies as this important transition comes
               to fruition," Governor Palin said. "The professional staff of both departments demonstrated
               their commitment to the state's mission of responsible resource development and
               conservation."

               Under DNR's management, the office has continued to fulfill its important statutory
               responsibilities. That will not change as the division moves back to ADF&G.

               'We recognize the importance of balancing habitat protection and resource development,"
               said Tom Irwin, Commissioner of DNR. "It is an essential part of the state's
               responsibilities."

               ADF&G Commissioner Denby Lloyd echoed Irwin.

               'We are pleased that the transition is going so smoothly, and that all of the state's habitat
               biologists and permitting staff are back under one roof," Lloyd said. 'Our commitment to
               responsible stewardship of Alaska's fish and game, as well as responsible development of
               our natural resources for the benefit of all Alaskans, Is stronger than ever."
