            Also, Joe, the Ethics Bill just passed unanimously in the House. This is very good.

            Things are good here! Despite the continued rain in Juneau!

              Hello Joe:

              Glad the word is out there that we have to take a hard look at the Mat-Su Prison plans.

              The only criticism I've heard about today's coverage of the issue is that no one informed
              Lyda of the concerns we had, and that she wasn't informed of any of this. I have a hard
              time believing that's the truth because I seem to recall hearing that we've briefed her or
              her staff anyway.

              So, if she's been briefed, either she or her press person (Jeff Turner) needs to be called on
              this. We'll suffer the wrath of Lyda and/or her supporters if she's let people believe we
              didn't inform her of concerns over this monumental issue. I don't want them to spin this
              into: "They're not communicating with us."

             Who knows what the motivation was when the reporter was told we didn't keep Lyda in
             the loop with her project, but it needs to be corrected so folks know we're not
             purposefully doing anything to undermine her project - we're just trying to be sensible.

             Thanks!
             Sarah
