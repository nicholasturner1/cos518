           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin:




           It seems the House is toying with you and the residents of Alaska. I would like to
           suggest to either hold them over in this session or immediately call them back for a new
           special session.  Those legislators need to learn to work together.  May a session on
           negiotiating win-win compromises?




           Well, I just needed to express my feelings. I WILL be using my voting power come election
           time to show my feelings.




           Thank you for your time.

                                                                 1
