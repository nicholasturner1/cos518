          You may be asked why we're taking these allegations so seriously , but some people believe
          we're not as committed to looking into all these corruptions trials.

          Dear Governor , Ramras seems to be getting a media bump . The News Miner and a mining
          trade publication have both asked us if we are looking into his letter . We have said yes
          and no more. Talis
