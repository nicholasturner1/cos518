           Governor,



           Bruce is jammed until about 7pm, which at that time he will cull together what we
           discussed this morning. I hate to delay, but I'd better commit to getting you the draft
           tomorrow instead of tonight.



           Meanwhile, Marty's went on KTUU camera for tonight, Sharon was correcting KTVA's piss poor
           reporting, and she also sent a letter to Fagan regarding he and Andrew's "scoop".



           F
