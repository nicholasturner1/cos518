        MESSAGE:

        Dear Governor Palin,




        I am a District Director for Soroptimist International of the America's in the
        Northwestern Region. Soroptimist are professional business women committed to improving
        the lives of women and girls, in local communities and throughout the world. District 1
        covers all of Alaska and Western Washington. We currently have 40 clubs with about 1500
        members.




        On October 6 & 7 we will be holding a District meeting in Fairbanks at the Princess lodge.
        I'm asking you if you might have the time to address our members at our up coming meeting.
        Our Federation recently had an article in our "Best for Women" magazine on women in
        government, here in the United States and around the world. You have shown what can be
        overcome by women in a polically male dominated position. Your presents at our meeting
        would give our members the feeling of accomplishment and encouragement.



        We would appreciate you taking this into consideration.



        Thank you for your time.


                                                               1
