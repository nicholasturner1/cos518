            I bought the AK Magazine today for my b-day when I saw your face at the checkout stand!

            Great article!     It's fun to see the kids in the magazine too.

            Carter and I spotted Piper's artwork on your desk. When Kyla gets home from b.ball
            practice I'll show her Willow's photos.

            I hope it's okay to send an email like this?

            Keep up the great work!

            Lesley
