          Governor,



         I have a call into Katz to further explain the riders issue . I talked to Privile ed o this
         morning and will be working to see what other positions we can figure out for her to work
         in. As for security , I am waiting to see what options Mike wants to go with as laid out in
         the security proposal.

         Not sure what this msg is about - before I contact Katz do you guys have info on this
         topic?



         Also, as I sit with Karen R today on budget cuts I'll be reducing Mansion staff and
         Security amounts so want to make sure you guys have folks prepared for that. Thanks!

         Alaska -

         With all of this in mind, I want to see whether there is anything = further we can do to
         help.  I know the situation in the House. = So, I'm not expecting miracles, but I'm
         hoping that there's a way for us = to give a good accounting of ourselves.



         Any information you can provide would be appreciated. If a = telephone call is easier,
         let's do that.



         Sorry to bring all of this to you on Monday morning.
