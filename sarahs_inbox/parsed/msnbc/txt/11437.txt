              MESSAGE:

              Gov. Palin -

             I supported your election for Governor and voted for you. I am now asking for you to
             consider endorsing the only remaining true conservative in the Presidential race, Mike
             Huckabee. We have a loyal movement across our great state, but Mike's supporters in Alaska
             could use a boost from a true Republican like you! I know that the Lt. Governor has chosen
             to endorse another candidate, but I hope that you will consider Mike Huckabee! If you want
             to learn more about our grassroots campaign here in Alaska, please go to
             www.alaskansforhuckabee.com



             Most Sincerely,

             Cate Chatman

             Alaska State Leader for Huck's Army

             Assistant Organizer for Alaska's meetups for Huckabee
