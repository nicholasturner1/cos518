           Governor - Bill Clarke from Chugiak ( Craig Williams ' s father ) called and wanted to speak
           with-you directly and "Thank you" for what you have done for Craig. He explained that
           this would only take 60 minutes and that he owed this to his son. I explained that due to
           your schedule I could not promise a return call but that I would make sure you knew of his
           call and his thanks
