           Good afternoon Governor,



           What a great day for a drive - you couldn't have picked it better.



           We are working on finalizing the bill signings for next Tuesday, June 24th. You are
           scheduled to sign HB 373 (sch bond debt reimbursement) by H FIN at the Chamber at noon.
           would like to propose you also sign HB 297 (veterinary residency) by Rep Neuman at the
           same time.



           My reasons are two-fold. First, if we hold the vet bill signing at gam (per Neuman's
           request to ensure Martin Buser's attendance) then you have too much time on your schedule
           between events.  Second, I don't think the media will show to both events and will more
           than likely attend the Chamber luncheon.



           My gut says to wrap them together in one event but we can handle it either way. Please
           let me know your preference and we will work with Neuman's office.



           Thanks so much.



           Kelly
