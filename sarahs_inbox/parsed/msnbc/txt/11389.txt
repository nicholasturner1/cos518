             Sharon : Heartbreaking to know someone would have leaked my email this morning- Sunny said
             it had to have been sent to ADN within the first hour . I think it would do me good to ask
             Kyle how he received it - he won ' t tell me , but he 'll know that I know how improper it is
             for internal emails to team members to be leaked to reporters.
