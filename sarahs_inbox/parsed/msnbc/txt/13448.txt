             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin, I am here now visiting your beautiful state, my husband and I will be
             moving here in July,(Company transfer) I want to congratulate you on your new little one,
             who is as you said "VERY SPECIAL." It was 47 years ago my mom, after having 7 children,
             was blessed one more time, this time with a "VERY SPECIAL" little lady named Ms. Eva, who
             is Downs also, she is the love of our lives. My Mom always told us the Lord only gives
             "SPECIAL CHILDREN" to "SPECIAL FAMILIES", she was right, her children know that it also
             took a "SPECIAL MOM" to help Ms. Eva thru life. There were many challenges my parents
             faced with her, but I know they would not change a thing they did to help Ms. Eva become
             the sweet caring young lady she is today. Today, my Dad & Ms. Eva help care for my
             "SPECIAL MOM" who is 88 yrs old, & bedridden, she sometimes forgets what day it is, where
             she is & sometimes mistake her children for her siblings, but she always recognizes, Ms.
             Eva.  As my "SPECIAL MOM" wo

            uld say "HE" saved the BEST for last, that "HE" did. Your children may want to read a
            book, my children read called, "The Man Who Loved Clowns" By June Rae Wood. Feel Blessed
            for your "SPECIAL CHILD" & May you enjoy him, for he will Love like no other child. God
            Bless you and your family. I Thank You for your time. Kathaleen Lopez Hammons
