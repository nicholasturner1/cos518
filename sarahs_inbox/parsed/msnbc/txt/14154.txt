                 Dear Governor Palin,

                 I would like to weigh in , regarding the below text, to making sure that Residents under 16 years of age are
                 allowed to hunt over bait stations in Unit 16 . I have 3 daughters . The two oldest are 10 and 9 and are
                 soon to join their dad in taking black bears over bait in Unit 16. Please assist the Department of Fish &
                 Game in making sure that this is possible for my daughters and many other families who participate in the
                 Alaska Lifestyle that we know you hold as dear as we do.

                 Thank you,

                 Gary Olson

                 Hunters,

                 It has come to my attention that ADF&G or the Board of Game have efectively eliminated Residents
                 under 16 years old from hunting over bait stations in Unit 16.
                 I have a feeling this was done by ADF&G, not the board.
                 I am confident that the board did not intend to eliminate residents under 16 from hunting over bait.
                 The traditional 'sport hunting ' bait station permit has been eliminated for resident hunters.
                 The only option a resident hunter has is to get a Predator control permit.
                 ADF&G should maintain the normal bear bait registration for residents , as well as have a predator permit.
                 This is 100% contrary to ADF&G's policy to'keep predator management and hunting seperate'.
                 Children under 16 years old are not allowed to participate in the Unit 16 bear predator control program.
                 The wolf control programs have no age limit, so it makes no sense to have one for bears.
                 This area has been hunted extensively by families with the use of bait stations for decades.

                 I have been told it is too late to change this for this year, I don 't buy it!

                 Dear Governor Palin-

                 I am writing to you requesting your support/assistance on scheduling hb200 to be heard in Senate
                 Finance. The couple of times that we have spoke with you on this bill you have expressed that you would
                 support it. It is a much smaller bill than the original draft. We have worked closely with Representative
                 Dahlstrom and her staff who have been working unremittingly on this legislation.

                 The 90 day session has us worried , this is our fourth year working this issue and I believe that we have a
                 piece of legislation that has the potential to pass.

                 We are 1 of only 9 States that don't have some sort of presumptive legislation for Fire Fighters.

                 I am planning on being in Juneau Monday through Friday next week if you would like to meet with me.

                 Thank you for your support, and keep up the great work!

                 Respectfully submitted,
