            Here's why pro-CON repeal folks can't get their hopes up... even our friends like Stoltze
            are sending mixed messages about who's to blame for sitting on this. We'll keep working on
            it today.

            I went by last night and Meyer was in a meeting, Chenault was out. It's #1 on my list for
            this a.m.



             I'm getting conflicting information from Stoltze, also, and dropped in on him last night
            but he was mtg with another leggie. I asked staff to let him know why I stopped by and
            that I'd follow up this a.m. We'll get it cleared up today.

            Mike- we didn't get to finish our conversation on Nancy's bill re: firefighters. I
           haven't acted on it, but I don't oppose it. Haven't seen a fiscal note on it, but if Nancy
           asks for our help on it I will help her out.



             Also, anyone know why Meyer and Chenault still won't schedule the CON bill? I tried
            calling both offices this evening but it was after hours. I'll try again tomorrow so that
                                                                    1

            I'm on record , again, as asking for hearings and action on the measure. I'm still 100-
            percent committed to repeal , and am perplexed and disappointed with their lack of
            progress.
