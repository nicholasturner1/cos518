Sure thing, Governor - I'm just headed to the office now and should be there in about 20 minutes.

I'll zip by the office on my way to kenai- I'll let you know right before I get to the office so you (or
someone) can meet me downstairs on the street with the kenai bill signing folder that I left on my
desk. Thanks!
