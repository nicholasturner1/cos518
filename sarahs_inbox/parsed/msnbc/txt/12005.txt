               Dear Governor Palin,
                   Last week you enquired about the Homer shooting . The Criminal Division established a panel to review the
               issue and recommended that there be no State of Alaska prosecution of the officers involved in the airport
               shooting . I thought I would have a written report confirming that before it was announced but now I see that
               Public Safety has been informed by the criminal division and in turn is advising the Homer police . This is to let
               you know the message is apparently out. Talis
