           MESSAGE:

           Dear Ms .   Palin:




           A number of Idaho residents have expressed great interest in your running with McCain as
           the Vice-Presidential candidate.  This would appeal to conservatives, women and a lot of
           other types that McCain currently has difficulty persuading that he's the man to vote for.
           I am a retired attorney and would gladly head up some sort of organization here in Idaho
           to set those wheels in motion. I know you're busy being the Governor but I, and a lot of
           other folks nationwide, really believe you could make the difference between a Republican
           and a Democratic White House this year. Please give it some thought.



           Thanks.



          Steve Dreher
