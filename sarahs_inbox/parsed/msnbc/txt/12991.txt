            Right on. Thank you. I'd think some press in southcentral AK will want to know more about
            what happened there too. If they ask, we'll have a good answer after working together on a
            reply before publicly stating how we feel about this. Thanks.

            The reason the IBU portion of this settlement is so late is that I was so mad about it at
            the end of the session last year that I held on to it and didn't submit it to the
            Legislature for funding.  I talked with our attorneys at Law on each of these settlements
            - Labor Relations Specialist Nancy Sutch's comment in the Empire comes the closest - we
            don't like having to pay.

             We are trying to amend the contracts, and you'll see the kind of pressure the unions will
            attempt here in the next few weeks.

             I'll work with Mike and Annette - clearly, this happened a long time ago - and we are
            working to get better language in the contracts so we don't end up in this same situation
            if something like this happens in the future. Karen

            We'll need a better explanation for the public ' s understanding ( than what was reported in
           news)... as I don't believe the story explained that this was not our doing, nor our
           choice to pay out these union demands . Thanks

             Governor - the funding in the supplemental request is based on an arbitration decision
            for monetary damages payable to the union for alternate service following the grounding of
            the LeConte in 2004. We did not receive the decisions in time to address this last
            session , so they are in the FY2008 supplemental request we submitted to the legislature.
            Commissioner Kreitzer can provide more information on the details of this if you need them

             Talis- did Mike get a chance to talk to you about this after my response to his question
            on EVOS yesterday? I'll forward my response to you that I'd sent him. I will defer to the
            board's desire to proceed on evos projects, based on my assumption that we've studied each
            proposal and it's the prudent (and fiscally conservative thing) to do - but for the record
            I do not know what the proposals, projects or purchases are.



             Also- Annette or whomever can answer: Juneau Empire reports on a nearly $5008 settlement
            from ,04 ferry grounding... it's in our budget - but I have not been told of this - if I
            am asked I do not have an answer . Please explain before I am asked. Thanks

            Dear governor palin.   Larry Hartig. Denby Lloyd and I have been meeting all day Saturday
           and today in preparation for a trustee meeting tomorrow. Monday. On the agenda tomorrow
           are several votes on habitat acquisition of several parcels for several million dollars.
           We will be asked to vote. These funds are from a habitat acquisition fund. The trustees
           have been making such purchases for years. Can the 3 of us get the green light to act in
           our best judgment tomorrow which in most of these would be to vote for the purchases? Can
           you just email the three of us a yes to proceed as we see approriate on these parcels. We
           are reluctant to vote until we know you have no philosophical objection. Talis.
