          Governor Palin-




          I just wanted to write you and let you know that people care about you and your work in
          this great state. I have friends who live across the country who see your work as an
          inspiration. We will all be praying for you asking that the One who has all the answers
          (even though social progressives and hard core Democrats don't want to admit it).




          Good luck in all you do-




                                                               I
