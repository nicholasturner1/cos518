              Governor - we need to confirm up and purchase flights for MN as flights are filling up fast with the
              thousands attending event Your first speech is Sept. 2 (evening). Your second speech will be either
              Sept 2 or Sept 3 (they are leaning more towards Sept. 3). The flights listed would put you in MN the day
              before the first speech on Monday, Sept 1. The return would be on Thursday, Sept 4 the day after your
              second speech. RNC is covering the airfare cost for you.
