             We need the response asap. Sharon/Beth, we need the response asap.

             Funny the leggies didn't communicate this to us before going to the media...

             And remember the ads I was in two yrs ago for All-Alaska and was roundly criticized by
             these same folks when I got elected for being "biased" towards? Hmmmmm

            Yes...and they waited for a POLL to push 'em to do it. If response is presented right
            will make them look extremely weak and reactionary.

            Wanted to give you guys a heads up from Don . He was in the ANGDA office and saw a
            resolution that the House and Senate are going to support .  The resolution calls for
            amending the special session agenda to include in-state gasline proposals to be
            considered . Don asked for a copy of the resolution , but they wouldn ' t give him one.



            Not sure if and when this is going to happen , but wanted to pass along . I just looked at
            the House and Senate floor calendar and I don't see it on there, nevertheless it could
            come up.

             What the Senate is doing on the floor is a JOKE. I'm speechless watching the public safety
             and infrastructure projects get eliminated by all but Therriault's minority Republican
             group... while Lyda and Stedman's group packs in frivilous earmarks for their own gain. If
             Alaskans knew what was going on in this building they'd be outraged.
