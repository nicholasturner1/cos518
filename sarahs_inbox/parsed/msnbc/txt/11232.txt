              Could we set up a re-cap after today on communication flow and getting accurate message
              out? I think its good to say that we've pulled some good lessons out of the last few
              days.  Very important that Anchorage and Juneau be working together on setting the record
              straight.  Communication is key, and we have a lot of tools available to utilize.




              15-30min should be sufficient.




             Thank you.




             Frank
