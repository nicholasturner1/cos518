            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin and Family:



            I have just read of your recent birth and wanted to congratulate you and wish you all the
            best.  I have a two year old son, Sam, who is also down syndrome . I can only tell you
            that he is a happy, healthy, wonderful child. He is my fourth son.   He has been a
            wonderful addition to our family and, quite frankly, very much like a typical child. The
            only difference has been that he is just a little bit delayed. We wish you all the best
            with your new family member.



            Sincerely,



            Ann and Ken Rudman
