               Sharon / Rosanne:

               Mal claims Forgey's story left out a lot of what he said to him. How do we deal with this guy and a newspaper
               editor that seems more than content to let poorly written and investigated stories be printed?

              As you suspected, Forgy only took snipets from Mal.

              Leo & Frank,
              For the record, today's Juneau Empire reported only half of what I said. What I said was, The permit is in its final
              stages. When received we will go to the commissioner with the permit and the project status and ask for direction.
              We do have the first segment ready to bid. He asked if that was a 23 mile segment and I said a 5 mile segment.
              He asked if it was to "draw" the expected law suit and I replied it could be.
              None of what he asked Reuben or I on costs, either roads or ferries, was used.
