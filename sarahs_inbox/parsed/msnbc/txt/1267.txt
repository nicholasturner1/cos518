MESSAGE:

Governer Palin,

Congratulations on the birth of your son!!!! He will bring many smiles to you and your family. I myself
have a 5m/o son who has Down Syndrome and every day he reminds me that he is more like my
other children than he is different. It can all be very overwhelming at the begining and as time goes
on you forget he has Down Syndrome because he is just like his siblings and you will wonder if the
chromosomal studies were correct. God bless you and your family!!!
