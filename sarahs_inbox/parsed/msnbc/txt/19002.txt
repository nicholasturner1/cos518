         Dear Governor:



         Sorry to bother you in the midst of a very hectic day, but I needed to ask you about this
         because the deadline for DOT to submit the State ' s proposed Highway Safety Plan is coming
         up next week .  The Plan has to be signed ( which to me means approved ) by the Governor or
         her designee ( Leo Von Scheben).



         Based on your earlier concerns , DOT amended the part of the plan saying the state will
         seek to pass legislation making wearing motorcycle helmets mandatory to encourage
         motorcycle riders to wear helmets.



         The only 2 other items I see that could cause major controversy:


       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




        I have asked DOT to hold off submitting the plan until close of business next Tuesday, so
        you would have time to consider whether to ask them to delete or amend these.



        Thanks



        Randy-
