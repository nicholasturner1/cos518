        Had a good talk with

         Lisa . Of interest, she has been working Village Safe Water projects too (particular
       focus on Buckland). Very frustrated but thinks she's making progress . I am going to hook
       up my staff with hers so we can get more info and better coordinate.

          AGIA: I told her of my trip and she was happy to hear of more interest. She raised
        concerns about tone of a PPT special session . She suggested that your message continue to
        be one of fair share relative to other jurisdictions (and steer away from the punitive
        talk of the Dems given that we want more companies investing here (and PPT hits more than
        just the producers). It was a good meeting, much too short.



           On airplane for SEA now . I will overnight there and finish to Houston tomorrow morning.
