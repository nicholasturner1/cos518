             Another priority I forgot to mention to ktuu is Thomas' $500 rebate from surplus... Sounds
             like his bill is the last one left with any breath and I 'd like to see it adopted this
             session - it's more fair than the income-based bill(s) introduced by others.

             Is it safe to say Stedman has still not shown us everything in his multi -million dollar
             spending bill that the House is adding on to... or have they released the item list but I
             just haven ' t seen it yet?
