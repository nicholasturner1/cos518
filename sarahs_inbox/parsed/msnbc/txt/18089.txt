        I was also asked by Stefan if the delay was a statement of opposition or spite, I
        immediately said absolutely not. This is about summer travel. That's why the Governor has
        more time to sign bills in the summer so that the work schedules and travel schedules can
        be met.  We had just hoped that the timing would work out and it cannot.



        Thanks,

         Meg
