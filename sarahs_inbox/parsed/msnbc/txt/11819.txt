              MESSAGE:

              I am writing to encourage your endorsement of MIKE HUCKABEE .  He is am amazing man with an
              amazing group of supporters who believe strongly in him.   We further believe your public
              endorsement will be critical to his campaign.



             Of the two left you have mentioned , Governor Huckabee is the only one who supports
             drilling in ANWR.



             Please consider making a public endorsement SOON ...... before it's too late!



             Sincerely,



             Tammy Gadbois
