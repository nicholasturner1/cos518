                  Subject: kenai
                 I was careful in my words re: Kenai flooding,, making sure people knew my belief that it's government's
                 role to get in there and repair public infrastructure damage... our role in the private property damages is
                 to make sure government doesn't get in the way of permitting the private property owners rebuild efforts.

                 Hopefully the Kenai reporter (though his headline was misleading) understood what my opinion is on this.
                 The headline made it sound like I stated blind support for government rebuilding private amenities like
                 docks, staircases, etc.
