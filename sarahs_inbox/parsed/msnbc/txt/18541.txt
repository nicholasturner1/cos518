         Thanks- and really they don't have to go through you to communicate all this! All I need
         is another set of eyes to look at my op-ed and correct anything that needs correcting.
         They can email me directly and then we move on to the next issue. It'll save a lot of
         time and then you can get on with your Saturday.



         Again, others can pen op-eds to include additional info for the public, including Sean,
         Anthony, etc.

         Bruce will be speaking to John Iversen in a few minutes . They will review and respond
         soon . Bruce is attempting to reach Pat but has not been successful yet.

        Thanks- mike and others can cc me in and/or come directly with me on their edits so we're
        not bugging you... and Joe has a similar suggestion to mike's re: Privileged orP so if all
        are cc'd in we can knock out the edits asap and get this over with. I'll make that change
        to the copy.
