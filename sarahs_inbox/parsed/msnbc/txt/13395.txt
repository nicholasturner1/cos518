             Our daughter has downs as well, she is now going on 11 in July and is the youngest of
             four.  She was a huge surprise and needed open heart surgery @ 4 months... later... a
             pacemaker @ l0years old . Lots of therapy and milestones in the middle as well as a major
             struggle with ASD and our "differing" opinions of what is best for Cierra.



             You are very correct in the statement that you were given Trig. Cierra has been the
             greatest joy of our entire family, she has taught our children how to be kind, generous,
             patient and compassionate . She has the best disposition and because we have 3 other
             teenagers and all of their friend around she is quite " mainstream " in most ways.



             You will always enjoy the gift of your son. Our oldest daughter Aerial graduates this
             year and our 16 year old Autumn will graduate next year, then our son Quest 3 years
             later... .they will all leave. I am glad Cierra will always be close.



             Good luck and enjoy your son!!
