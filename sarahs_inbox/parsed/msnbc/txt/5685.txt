             Governor Palin,

             I wanted you to see this email. I know it was rushed today when I asked you about this board so I've held off on
             contacting Privile ed or until we know for sure which direction we want to go. First thought from Bit, Tibbles,
             Nizich wa Privi is the right choice. Take your time thinking about it. We don't have to know today.

             You're awesome.

            Thanks Commissioner. I agree with your assessment of f rivileged or Legislative confirmation is required by
            statute, but not permissible under the Constitution ; therefore, we don 't have to send a name down . I will talk with
            Mike and the Governor to see which direction they want to move so we can expedite this appointment.

            Thanks again for reminding me of this board.

            Ivy

             Ivy:
             I don't know if you are aware of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), but it is a fisheries
             advisory group headquartered in Portland Oregon that deals with information/data and other issues, but not
             regulatory management, important to Alaska and Pacific Northwest fisheries. Alaska gets three appointed seats
             on the Commission, all chosen by the Governor and confirmed by the legislature . The three seats are: an officer
             of ADF&G, a member of a legislative resource committee, and a citizen at large.

             Currently the Alaska members are Sue Aspelund (sitting for the Commissioner) from ADF&G, Sen. Ben Stevens,
             and Stephanie Madsen. Obviously, Senator Ben Stevens' s seat needs a replacement. We recommend you
             consider the following legislators , in rank order:

         Privileged or Personal Material Ra'




             As for the citizen seat, Stephanie Madsen's current term expires Nov. 8, 2008.

             FYI.

             If you need more information, please let me or Sue Aspelund know.

             Thanks, DL.

             Denby,
             Here is the response I received from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission with regard to our
             vacancy for the legislative seat. The in-state meeting is held each spring in Juneau, and this year the
             Annual meeting is to be held in San Diego, CA in late August or early September.

             Herman:
             Governor Frank Murkowski appointed Senator Stevens to the Legislative
             Seat, and Stephanie Madsen to the Marine Fisheries Seat on November 8,
             2004.

             Following is what I have as the Alaska Statue regarding this matter:
             Sec.16.45.020 - Alaska Statute:
             "The term of each commissioner of the Pacific Marine Fisheries
             Commission is four years.   A
             Commissioner holds office until a successor is appointed and qualified,
             but the successor' s term expires four years from the legal date of
             expiration of the term of the successor ' s predecessor . Vacancies
             occurring in the office of a Commissioner for any reason or cause shall
             be filled for the unexpired term, or a Commissioner may be removed from
             office as provided by the statues of the state concerned. Each
             Commissioner may delegate in writing from time to time to a deputy the
             power to be present and participate including voting as a representative
             or substitute, at a meeting of or hearing by or other proceeding of the
             Commission."
             Sec. 16.45.030 - Alaska Representatives:
             "In furtherance of the Compact provisions, there are three members of
             the Commission from the State of Alaska, appointed by the Governor and
             confirmed by the Legislature in Joint Session. One Commissioner must be
             the administrative or other officer of the Alaska Department of Fish and
             Game charged with the conservation of the state' s marine fisheries
             resource; another commissioner must be a member of the legislature of
             this state who is a member of the committee on resources ; and another
             member must be a citizen of this state who has a wide knowledge of and
             interest in the marine fisheries problem."
             Sec. 16.45.040 - Terms of Commissioners:
             "The term of each commissioner of the Pacific Marine Fisheries
             Commission is four years.    A Commissioner holds office until a successor
             is appointed and qualified, but the successor's term expires four years
             from the legal date of expiration of the term of the successor's
             predecessor .   A Commissioner may be removed from office by the Governor
             upon charges and after a hearing. The term of a Commissioner who ceases
             to hold the qualifications required ends and a successor may be
             appointed.    Vacancies occurring in the office of a Commissioner for any
             reason or cause shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same
             manner as for a full term appointment."

             I hope this is the information that you need.
             I apologize for taking so long to get this to you.        Things here are
             incredibly busy,  good, I guess.
             Let me know if you need something in addition.

             Hello Ladies,
             Could you please remind me again how I go about having the
             Commissioner ' s Seat from Alaska that is the legislative seat re-filled?

             Senator Ben Stevens held that chair and he did not run for reelection.
             Beautifully clear and a whopping 4 degrees out in Juneau today. You
             should be here!
