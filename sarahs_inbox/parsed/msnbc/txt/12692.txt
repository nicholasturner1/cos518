           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,



           Jason Lewis, Rush Limbaugh sub, announced today that you would a viable Vice President
           candidate. It is said that you want growth in oil production. It is my understanding of
           the conversation that the Republican Party is too deep into global warming hence the rise
           in gasoline prices.

           As a veteran, I love our country and want a government for the people and by the people.

           With your permission, I would love to send communications to Senator McCain voicing you as
           his pick for Vice President.
