 Confirmation of the Remarks/Ribbon Cutting for the American Cancer Society's
 Relay for Life was confirmed on 04.14.08. The Governor may not be available
 to attend and would like Todd/First Family to participate in this event. I
 have notified Karen Layton to let her know that if the Governor was not
 available to attend that the First Gentleman and First Family would be
 attending on the Governor's behalf.

 Also, I let Karen know that the Communications Department - Kate Morgan
  (possibly) would be contacting her directly in regards to this event. I have
 only confirmed the remarks and ribbon cutting from 7:30 - 7:45 p.m. on Friday,
 05.16.08.  I declined the tour of the race, etc. that they asked if the
 Governor would like to do beginning at 6:00 p.m.
