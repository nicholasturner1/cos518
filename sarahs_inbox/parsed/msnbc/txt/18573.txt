             Governor,

             Mike Tibbles asked me to forward the attached proposed letter from the DC office drafted by
             John Katz, Diane Barrans , and Larry Persily for your consideration.

             It relates to the proposed federal rules covering the relationship between lenders and colleges
             and universities that could hurt the ability of the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary
             Education to provide the best services and lowest -cost loans to Alaska students (an
             unintended consequence of the federal crackdown on sweetheart deals between some
             lenders and some schools) which is exactly what the commission is told to do under state
             law.

             Lynne
