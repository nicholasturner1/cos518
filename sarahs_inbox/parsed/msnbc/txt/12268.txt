              Governor Palin,

             I just read the press release on Todd's accident. My thoughts and prayers for a speedy
             recovery are with you and your family.

             HESS has had numerous presentations on Traumatic Brain Injury , as well as many families
             advocating for early intervention with individuals who have suffered from TBI. This injury is
             hard to identify (symptoms may resemble the flu, dizzy , etc.) and wearing a helmet or body
             armor does not guarantee that an injury hasn't occurred, that said I hope you will consider a
             follow up when Todd is back home.

             If you would like more information our office would be happy to track the information down for
             you and forward it to your office.

             Sincerely,

             RcpresentativeAnna Taiiv1                  jfi
