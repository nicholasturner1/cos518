             That would be great. Kris Perry can help on my end with scheduling a time. Thanks!

            The Senator indicated to me that he wants to spend as much one on one time as possible
            discussing issues with Governors this weekend. If you like, I'm happy to set this up.



              Look forward to seeing you Governor.

             And is there any possibility I could hear from McCain on Alaska' s resource development
            issues ? (ie. why is he opposed to ANWR oil drilling, why is he hooked up with Lieberman on
            a few anti-development initiatives?)



             If anyone can help me hear from him on that, our state would appreciate it. I'll have a
            tough time explaining my support for him until I can say I spoke with him about my
            concerns re: any pro-environmental stands he's taking that could hurt Alaska.

              Governors,



              I'm looking forward to seeing many of you this weekend. I know how tightly these
            weekends are scheduled, but I wanted to make sure all of you were aware of a gracious
            invitation we just received from John McCain.  He is hosting a governors and spouses only
            reception at the Willard prior to the Statesman dinner on Saturday night where he is our
            special guest.  I know your RGA briefings have already gone out, which is why I wanted to
            personally highlight this addition and ask you to attend. The reception will be at
            6:15pm.  I'll be sure RGA gets your schedulers more information on this.



              The other ask I have of you is to stay in Washington for the Gala on Monday night. It
            is President Bush's last RGA dinner and we will all be sitting on the stage as he delivers
            his remarks.  Over the years the President has been a great friend to RGA and he was
            active as a governor so I want to make sure we are all there to express our appreciation
            to him.  Another important reason we need you to attend is this is our biggest fundraiser
            of the year for RGA.



               I hope you will consider these two requests . See you soon.



               Rick
