              Half a million (493,000-plus) qualified Alaskans will receive the 2008 dividend directly deposited
              into their bank accounts on September 12, historically early. The Department of Revenue's PFD
              Division will be mailing checks to all remaining eligible Alaskans on September 30, with those
              checks expected to arrive within two weeks.

              Seven out of 10 Alaskans (456,795 out of 641, 000) used the Internet to file for this year's
              dividend . Many Alaskans have said that the dividend itself has allowed them to acquire a computer
              in their home and to become connected to the rest of the world , whether they live in a city, town
              or remote village.

              $17.2 billion has been distributed to eligible Alaskans since the dividend program began in 1982.
              The first dividend was $1000, covering three years. Individual Alaskans eligible for all 27 dividends
              have received more than $30,000.

              Dividend Information Offices are located in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau and are responsible
              for assisting applicants who need help completing their applications or need information about the
              dividend program.

              Please remember that the Alaska PFD and the new Alaska Resource Rebate are taxable income for
              Federal Tax Returns. Be sure to set aside enough to cover your tax bill, or consider making an
              Estimated Payment when you get your PFD. For more information on how to report the Alaska PFD
              and Rebate income on the Federal Tax Return contact the IRS at 1(800)829-1040 or visit the IRS
