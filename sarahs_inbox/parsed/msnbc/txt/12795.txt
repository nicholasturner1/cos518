           getting over the top with this. Thanks, Janice

            address: 13209 Collingwood Ter Silver Spring MD 20904




            MESSAGE:

            We understand that you have been discussed as a possible choice for the Vice Presidency.




            As people who support the democratic process and care about protecting our wildlife for
            future generations, we want you to know that we don't believe people in our states would
            vote for you for any office if they knew your record on these issues.




           It is troubling that you are now working to deny more than 50, 000 Alaskans a vote on
           aerial killing of wolves and bears with legislation now being considered in the Alaska
           legislature.




           it is deeply concerning that last year you proposed using helicopters and a $150 bounty to
           spur wolf killing in specified management zones -- despite strong scientific opposition to
           the state's aerial hunting program and the lack of reliable information on how many wolves
           actually exist in these areas.




           And it is baffling that you appointed your high school basketball coach -- a man with no
           relevant experience -- to the state's board of game, and have condoned a $400,000 state-
           funded propaganda campaign to convince Alaskans that wildlife biologists from around the
           world are wrong when they say that the state's shooting of wolves and bears from airplanes
           is scientifically unfounded.




           We sincerely hope that you will recognize the importance of respecting the democratic
           process and protecting Alaska's wildlife in the future. But until then, you will not have
           the support of those of us who care about the democratic process and protecting our
           natural treasures for future generations.
