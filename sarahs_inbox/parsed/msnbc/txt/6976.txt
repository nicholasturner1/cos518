            Governor:
            Everyone on our end so appreciated the event. Sorry we ended up having technical
            difficulties - the crew did two run throughs ahead of time. You sounded great,
            despite your cold and everyone in ANC enjoyed the recognition and the fact that you
            were there.

            We debriefed a bit and the group will do a pre-planning event for the next one next
            year. Sorry it was so crowded in the conference room, but we were led to believe a
            smaller crowd would be there and didn't know the other commissioners would be
            there.

            All in all, folks seemed to think it went very well. Hope you were happy with it, too.
