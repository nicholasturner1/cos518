             Marty- that was an excellent response letter to Ramras. You'd think it would go a long way
             in explaining our committment to in-state use. And the assurance that not only does AGIA
             not compete with in-state line(s), but it encourages and facilitates it via the 500 mcf
             no-compete provision.



             If Ramras chooses to NOT receive that message, then he's just pulling a Ramras on us.



             Thanks for the good letter to him.
