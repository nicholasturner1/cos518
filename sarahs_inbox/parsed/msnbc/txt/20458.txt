           MESSAGE:

           Dear Sarah,



           Our 7/ 8th grade TEAM at Goldenview Middle School is concerned about the lack of
           professional development available in our state and would like to attend the Middle School
           Conference in Denver , Colorado from October 29th -November 2nd.   Seldom are classroom
           teachers given the opportunity to participate since minimal professional leave is given
           out per building and no grants or funding is available for plane tickets, conference fees,
           or lodging .  The four of us would like to attend this valuable meeting this fall so we can
           learn the latest trends and techniques in our subject areas .    This opportunity is
           invaluable to us since our building has not attained Adaquate Yearly Progress under the No
           Child Left Behind legislation for the past two years and want to learn more about our
           " students in the middle " during their critical teen years.



           Sincerely,



          Kim Barnes, Science




                                                                 1
