    Hello Willow and Bristol. The Palin family is invited to have dinner on the Cruise Ship Mercury
    on May 20 at 6:00pm. They have also invited you to bring a friend or two with you! I need to
    supply the birthdays and driver's license numbers (if you have one) of any guests. Picture ID will
    be needed to board the ship (I hope that doesn't mean Piper!). Please supply this information
    about your friends to me by Monday if you'd like to invite them. Bristol, I have your b/d but not
    your driver's license number. Thanks. Kari.
