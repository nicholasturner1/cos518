             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,




             I can't help but be troubled by media reports that say if you were asked to be a vice
             presidential running mate for John McCane, you would consider it. With all the your
             perceived dedication to improving the state of Alaska---I feel that your political
             ambition outweighs your focus on Alaska. Alaskans voted for you to lead our state into a
             fiscally sound and prosperous era and you are admired and adored by your Alaskan populous.
             of course, I know the likely hood of you becoming a vice presidential running mate is not
             likely, but how do you think Alaskans would feel if you are already considering moving on
             to a more glorious pursuit.   We love you Governor Palin---- please hang around while and
             help our state----you are young and I'm sure that you have a promising political career--
             just spend a little more time building a legacy for Alaskan..and yourself here in the 49th
             state. Cathie Lynn Russell
