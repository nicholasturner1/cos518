             Yes.- the update on the King Air is that it will not be available until Wed. We have all
             commercial flights through Mon. That are listed on your calendar. Hope Todd is feeling
             well after yesterday - Janice

               Just fyi- we ended up with one too many rooms because the rollaway can fit into the
              second room- so I cancelled the one.

               And again to confirm we're not looking at the king air for tomorrow, don't know it's
              status for Monday's return to Juneau but assume that will be commercial also?
