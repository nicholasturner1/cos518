             Congratulations on your new baby! We heard about your precious gift and wanted you to
             know how happy we are for you and your family .  In a world where some people would have
             chosen a different course , we are so happy to hear of a woman who chooses the gift of life
             over what others might erroneously consider a burden .  Happy Mother ' s Day . Lorraine
