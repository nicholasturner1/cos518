           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin.,




           First let me congratulate you and your family on your new addition to your brood,Tyrg.
           Thank you God for little Tyrg.




           I watched the interview with Glen Beck and I wanted to let you know as an Alaskan since
           1962, I am so very proud to call you our Governor. You are articulate and know what you
           are talking about. You represent our great state with intelligence and class.




           I'm sure most Alaskans support you in your endeavors on this most important issue of our
           energy resources being locked up while the whole nation slams our President about gas
           prices and the economy.




                                                                1
