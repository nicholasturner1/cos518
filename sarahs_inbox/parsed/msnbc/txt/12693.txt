           Dear Gov Goddess,



           If asked are you going to be the VP of the USA?

           You would be an incredible asset to the Republican ticket.



           I married a girl who out shoots me on the fire range, I would be so proud to have a woman
           VP that would and could out shoot me and our current VP ;-)



           Let us know as soon as John McCain asks you. I will be happy to help out in any way.



           Sincerely

           John Apostoli
