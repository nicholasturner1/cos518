          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,




          I would like to know if you would consider a vice presidential bid in the republican
          party .......... if asked. You are an outstanding governor with conservative values. You are
          just what the republican party needs in this election.




          I know you may not respond.... as I am in PA and I am sure you are a busy woman. You should
          at least know that leaders like yourself are appreciated the country over. We need more
          men and women like yourself.




          Sincerely,

                                                               1
