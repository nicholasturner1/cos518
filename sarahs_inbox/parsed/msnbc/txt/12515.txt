            Subject: interview requests




            Governor -



            Channel 13 is looking for an interview on your            NGA trip. Fox Business News is looking for
            another Exxon. Valdez interview - at this point           we don't have satellite confirmation so I'm
            not sure that will work. And Steve Quinn wants            to know if you can call him after hours to
            talk about the state republican convention and            Ben Stevens serving as national
            committeeman.
