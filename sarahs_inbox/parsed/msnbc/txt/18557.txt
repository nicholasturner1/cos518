                Hello Governor,

                If you ' re up to having the Colony team over after the game-
               We could order pizzas and make some brownies , plus use up the leftovers from the DOA reception. We
               have 3 boxes of brownie mix and Diane said she could make them Thursday , so they're ready to go. She
               really loves to bake and do that kind of stuffl

               Just let me know what you and Molly decide - and we'll make sure it happens! :) If you want, I could just
               coordinate this with Molly.

               Thanks for having us over for dinner , we really enjoyed spending time with you and your family! Your
               parent' s home is definitely an Alaskan treasure !!! It was fun seeing the kids in their own stomping
               grounds.:)
               Erika
