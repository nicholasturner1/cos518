              Good Afternoon Governor -

              I have switched over all of your appointments from the OnTime Calendar to the Outlook Calendar this
              afternoon . I will be using only the Outlook Calendar for all appointments from here forward. You should
              be able to view your calendar on your BlackBerry at this time. It will show under the "calendar" icon. The
              BlackBerry will not show appointments in color.

             I have kept the color coding that I was informed that you preferred : Red for all your meetings , Green for
             holidays and any personal appointments ; Black for FYI. There are many color options and these can be
             changed to your preference.

             Those that have "read only rights" for your calendar as of Monday , 07.09 .07: GOV, Mike Tibbles, Sunny
             Cayce, Kris Perry.

             I have the only "scheduling rights". I am always available by email and phone - 321-2423.

             Thank you for this opportunity to work for this Administration . Janice
