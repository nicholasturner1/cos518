               Dear Governor Palin:

               Deputy Chief Michelle Weston would like to extend an invitation for you to ride on the Fire Department's
               wildfire helicopter (Rotor 1 ) sometime this week at your convenience. It will take about an hour- flying
               over the greater Anchorage area.

               We look forward to hearing from you.


               Ronda Robison

               Anchorage Fire Department
