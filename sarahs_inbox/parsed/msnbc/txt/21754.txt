              Subject: Update: House Finance




              House Finance just voted ( 6 to 5 ) to bring the rate back down to 22 . 5, per an amendment
              introduced by Rep . Chenault .  The result is a bill that will move to the floor with a
              22.5% rate and 0 . 4% progessivity . The vote went as follows:



               Yeas : Chenault, Meyer, Hawker , Foster , Joule, Thomas

              Nays :     Kelly, Stoltze , Crawford , Gara, Nelson



              By the time they were ready to vote we knew Joule wasn 't going with 25, but we still knew
              Thomas and Nelson were in play. Neither was making any commitment to us. Nelson
              ultimately voted for 25, so we 're encouraged by that and what it says for the floor vote.
              Thomas was a bit more complicated.



             Before Thomas voted, he stated very clearly that he was ready to vote for 25 UNLESS Gara's
             retroactivity amendment was adopted on the floor (in which case he would go with 22.5).
             Thomas' rationale was that he didn't want the state to get "too greedy" by raising the tax
             rate AND collecting taxes retroactively.  Note that the retroactivity amendment had just
             failed in committee and both Kelly and Gara pointed that out, hoping that Thomas would go
             with 25.  It didn't matter, as Thomas still wound up voting for 22.5. Thomas maintains
             that he is comfortable with switching back to 25 when voting on the floor-if retroactivity
             is not part of the bill. It can be difficult to guess where their heads are at times, but
             thiswould at least give us some expectation that Thomas is with us on 25 as long as
             retroactivity stays out of the bill.

              We knew it was always going to come down to the floor vote .  We hoped the bill would go to
              the floor with the 25% rate for the sake of momentum , but it wasn ' t a necessity . Our vote
              count for the floor still shows us with enough support for 25% .   We now have to focus on
              those that could flip for any number of reasons . We'll huddle - up tonight/tomorrow and let
              you know if we have any names for you call.
