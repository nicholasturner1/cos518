           Governor,

          We wanted to be sure you had a heads-up that DEC and HSS will be holding a joint press
         conference Monday morning to announce new consumption guidelines for Alaska fish.
         Basically , pregnant or nursing women, teenage girls , and children under twelve should
         limit consumption of sport-caught yelloweye rockfish, halibut, and lingcod to two meals
         per week.   We have worked with the agencies to be sure they emphasize the overall positive
         message about the health benefits of Alaska ' s fish while providing the necessary
         information to the public about recommended consumption limits for certain species. We
         have also held meetings with fishing industry representatives to give them advance notice
         of the announcement.

          Cora
