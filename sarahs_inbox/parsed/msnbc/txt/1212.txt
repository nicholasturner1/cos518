Dear Sarah and Family .. . Cong rats on the precious baby boy ... How lucky he is to be born into your
family , and how lucky you are to have him . Yes there will be some tough times ahead . I've worked
with so many " Downs " kids and I can tell they are truly amazing little ones - so full of love and joy and
happiness and isn 't that what each of us wants for our children . We are so proud that you brought
that baby boy"home " to be born . Can't believe you got on a plane in Texas and flew home so you
would be here to deliver him ... Sarah you ROCK!!!!

If you're in the valley and ever need a baby snuzzeler , I would be honored...

HUGS!!!!!!

Yvonne Peterson
