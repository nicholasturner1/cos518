          Dear Mr. Miller:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

         I was delighted to see you actually follow through and veto some of the more egregious
         examples of budgetary lard. Your stated criteria of "not a State function" is a good one.
         I would have been even more happy to see you go even further - in particular I would have
         liked to see the Morris Thompson " culture" center on the list.



         But it was a good start.
