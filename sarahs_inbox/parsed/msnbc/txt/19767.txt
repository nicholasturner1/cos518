           Walt was in the valley yestereday (ironically, I assume be Glass and Lyda are in the
           valley)... Word getting back to me on that makes me wonder- did lyda ever meet w Wlat
           during his tenure? She didn't support him be of his concealed carry positions and budget
           issues. It would be telling if she is meeting w him at this controversial time, if we have
           info showing she never wanted to meet w him before to help w DPS missions/issues.
