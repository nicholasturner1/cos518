                Subject: Letter from Mayor Alsworth seeking support because of No Barge fuel Delivery to Lake Iliamna
                         Communities this fall (Energy Needs)
               Dear Governor Palin,

               Mayor Alsworth requested I send you the attached letter from Lake and Peninsula Borough seeking your
               support for runway improvements within the Lake and Peninsula Borough as it appears flying fuel into
               many of our Cities and villages is going to be the norm in the future and most of the State operated
               runways within the Borough need to be lengthened to accommodate this task except for Iliamna and Port
               Heiden. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

               I have also attached the Borough Map to show the locations of each community within the Borough. If
               you or staff needs additional information please let us know.

               Sincerely,

               Marv Smith
               Community Development Coordinator
               Lake and Peninsula Borough
               Phone 907-246-3421
               Fax 907-246-6602
