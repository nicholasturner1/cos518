           Tonight ' s great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and
          still be successful . There ' s a Costco in Juneau , if you know what I mean. And my family is
          quite capable of setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

           Great idea!  Please all decide what is best for AGIA. But if time doesn't matter
          tonight is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.
          Again decide what is best for AGIA. Tom

            Cool! We should cook it for whomever needs to have that get-together/reception
          opportunity tonight, tomorrow, or wednesday. I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good
          opportunity to have folks over for informal gasline chat.
