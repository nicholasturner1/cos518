  Hi Todd,

  Are you interested in attending the NGA 2008 Spouse's Seminar in Jackson Hole, Wyoming?
   It's not until September 21st, but they're asking for a response to their questionnaire by October
  19th. They're not asking for a commitment, they just need to know if you're interested so they
  can begin preliminary planning.

  Thanks!
  Erika
