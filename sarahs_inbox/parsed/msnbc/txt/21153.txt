          Spoke with Rick Solie today. He indicated he thinks ConocoPhillips will keep its head down
          in the special session environment, indicating he doesn't think they will be super visible
          walking the halls. In his words, "We're just going to let the sovereign do what the
          sovereign is going to do."



         He also indicated that he doesn't agree (and I couldn't tell whether it was him or if he
         was sneaking for COP) with the high dollar ad camnaian currently being run in print and on
         tv. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
