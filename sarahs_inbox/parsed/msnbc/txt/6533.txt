          Are you guys in the path of Hurricane Flossi (Big Island, Hilo or South side)? Hope you
          have more sun than clouds. Pls keep me informed if you change plans or need anything. Just
          not sure which island you're on. (I called Mike when I read the news but I'm not passing
          it on).
