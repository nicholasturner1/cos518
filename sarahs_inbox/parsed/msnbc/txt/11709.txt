             Sharon's been trying to set up an editorial bd mtg with NewsMiner while I'm here for the
            session . Sounds like they want to wait until I'm in fairbanks - for a personal visit,
            which is ridiculous since I'm the one offering, inviting myself to face the firing squad
            sooner rather than later. She's still trying.



              And I'm trying to find time in an afternoon to call Dukes. I'll ask janice to try to
             sched that sometime next week.

             Governor,  as we just discussed yesterday if you have time call Michael Dukes. You / we
            all couldn't ask for a better source of getting accurate info to the public.   I just
            heard from Senator Therriault that after his visit to the Fairbanks Daily Newsminer
            Editorial Board he thinks it would be worth your while to visit. May or may not be
            pleasant but we still want to communicate with them.

               Sounds good. I'm usually not a wet blanket, but I'm sure hoping we haven't already
             missed the boat on some of the messaging - based on what supportive legislators have
             shared with me, and supportive confidants in my personal life. After feeling like folks
             were getting tired of hearing me nag about the need for proactive , aggressive messaging,
             my own "fired up - ness " sort of climaxed some weeks ago. We ' ll hopefully catch up some with
             the message that , " Yes, believe it or not, we do believe we know what we're doing on the
             gasline".



              .I hadn ' t seen any Fairbanks request for any mtg or call in - had I known I'd have
             answered that of course I could call in while I ' m in Fairbanks.



               Thanks!

               Governor,




              I just wanted to express to you the angst I have been feeling in recent weeks to GET OUT
            THERE, and PLAY OFFENSE on messaging AGIA.  I am elated to tell you that I have a green
            light from everybody on the AGIA Messaging Plan, and that I am implementing it
            IMMEDIATELY.  A few short-term high points you'll see:
                                                              3




                                                                                                        PRA GSP01_0011130

               1.  The National Plan is in swing .  Kurt and I are traveling to DC to begin laying the
             groundwork on.obtaining endorsements from key trade groups , consumer groups , environmental
             groups, etc.   Katz has offered us full support, and we'll use it.   We will get the
             procurement out for a communications consultant to set up your east coast media blitz,
             probably around the time we announce the licensee.



               2.  Dan Saddler is going to join the team. Dan will monitor the Alaskan dialogue (print
             and airwaves), field and traffic calls from reporters relative to AGIA (freeing Sharon and
             Beth from that), joining me in issue-spotting for the team and adding written pieces to
             the FAQ I got posted to the AGIA website, etc. His TOP PRIORITY is to facilitate a
             statewide radio blitz for Marty/Tom/Kurt NEXT WEEK .  In this way, we will be reaching tens
             of thousands of Alaskans, an excellent complement to the relative few we can touch at the
             Town Hall meetings . We'll also get. on the VERY NEXT agenda at Commonwealth North,
             Alliance, Chamber, etc., to deconstruct myths and advance the positive messages we need
             out there.  And note, these appearances will not be a one-time blitz, they will be an
             ONGOING dialogue with the public: as new issues (from Halcro/Murk/Bowles counterpunches)
             reach a pitch, a new radio blitz week will be orchestrated to get the truth to the people.




               3.  Rhonda is on board to help with Native group messaging. BTW, Tom and I will be
             addressing the ANCSA Board CEOs on 2/15 - I have been working with Janice, but REALLY need
             to hear if you're able to call in for 10 mins at the beginning of that meeting, around 9;
             I know you'll be in Fbx, but hopefully that can work).



               4.   Joe is heading up the Juneau messaging, assigning us as needed.



               I am fired up, and itching to take the fight to the people. We cannot afford to sit
             back, we MUST defend this process vigorously, because it is what Alaskans deserve and
             need . I am sick of Wentzel and Halcro being the only voices in the room. We can engage
             them and we can beat them. Why? We are smarter and more committed, and more importantly,
             we are RIGHT.
