                  Subject: MSNBC Interview for Tomorrow morning
                 MSNBC is doing a segment on listing polar bears as Endangered Species. It begins at
                 9:30am (East Coast time).

                 On the program , they will have the World Wildlife Fund . Producers wanted to know If
                 anyone from the State would be interested in joining in on the discussion since we oppose
                 the listing . The alternative is to provide a statement ( I did forward the Governor 's letter to
                 Secretary Kempthorne so they understand the rationale behind our thinking).

                 Are any of you interested ? It would be great to be a part of it . We could certainly bring the
                 AGIA into it, in that at a time when no human interaction is impacting the bears , we need to
                 provide a safe, secure energy supply for the nation and listing the polar bears could disrupt
                 that need.

                 Need an answer soon , please....

                 Thanks,
                 meg
