                Dear Representative Johnson,

                My name is Ariel Hyams and I'm from Anchorage.
                I support the State of Alaska appropriating funds to match the $2 million Anchorage Pool Repair Bond.
                Pools are important to the safety and health of all Alaskans. They are also Incredibly important to me. I
                have been swimming competitively for 11 years and I have a hard time imagining what else I would do if
                the pools were to close . Please support the pool bonds and keeping our pools open!

                Sincerely,
                Ariel Hyams
