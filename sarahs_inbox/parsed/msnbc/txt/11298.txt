            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov. Palin:



            You are my hero! I greatly appreciate and respect all you do for the Alaskan people.
            (Meta Bottjen is my neighbor and good friend in Seldovia.) I know you support the funding
            of the AMHS.



           My husband and I own and operate this on-line newspaper. Sending the lead article "AMHS in
           Crisis" in this week's paper for your review.
