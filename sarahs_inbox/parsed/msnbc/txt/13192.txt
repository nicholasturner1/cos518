               Update:

               AIDEA/AEA and DMVA/EM flew out to the avalanche area on Friday afternoon to survey the damages.
               AEA is working with AEL&P on both a short term and long term fix.
               AEL&P and AEA are considering an above ground transmission line to get the community back on Hydro power
               and off diesel generators.
               AEL&P and AEA are trying to find a possible source for this cable.
               FEMA and SBA will be in Juneau this week to survey the situation.
               AEL&P is working on digging out the snow from the foundations to make sure there has been no damage to the
               foundation base.
               General Campbell will be calling for a DPC this Wednesday to go over all the information we know and make sure
               all agencies are thinking about all possible options and solutions.

               Will know more later
