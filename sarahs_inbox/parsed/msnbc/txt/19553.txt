                   Congressman Ralph Hall (Republican, Texas ) = called this morning to seek your support for draft legislation
                   (pasted = below) that would convey the Coastal Plain of ANWR to the State of Alaska = in order to facilitate
                   oil and gas development there. The Congressman is working closely with Congressman Young = on the bill
                   and says that he has discussed it personally with President = Bush, who would sign the legislation If it gets
                   to his desk. =

                   I was non-committal pending this communicat= ion to you. There is no question that the Palin
                   administration = supports responsible oil and gas development in'the Coastal Plain.&nbs= p; Privileged or P
                  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                  The legislation would also require a 50/50 = revenue share between the State and federal governments and
                  would impose a = prohibition on oil exports . With the exception of a = few Alaskans , most people believe
                  that these requirements are = inevitable in any ANWR bill that has a chance of passing.
