          Dear Mr. Roy:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

         Thanks for sticking to your guns and keeping the legislature in check.    While sme of the
         projects may have been personally lucrative ( I'm in.construcion),     None of the vetoed
         items are critical at this time.



         Thanks again,       keep up the good work,
