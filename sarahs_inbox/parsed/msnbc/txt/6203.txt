             Governor,

             I have two extradition orders here that I should sign . One is for a fugitive in Alaska who committed multiple
             offenses in the State of California including 2 counts of selling a controlled substance , possession and operating a
             vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance . The other order is for a fugitive from Washington that has
             been charged with burglary in the first degree , malicious mischief in the first degree , theft in the first degree,
             felony harassment , possession of explosives without a permit , and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.

             To authorize the extraditions , I do need to sign an affidavit stating that I have personally talked to you by phone
             and you authorized me to sign the orders . I was unable to reach you on the cell but if we could touch base briefly,
             I can get these back to the criminal division for action . Thank you.

             Mike
