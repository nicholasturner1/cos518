                Subject:       Please forward attached to Governor Palin ASAP
                Importance: High
                Mindy,

                I sent the attached letter in the mail but want Governor Palin to see it as soon as possible . Mike from my
                office called your office and was told they could not give out the Governor 's email address and that
                emailing it to you would be the fastest way to get it to Governor Palin . Please ensure that she sees it as
                soon as possible.

                Thanks for all your help.

                Kevin Meyer
