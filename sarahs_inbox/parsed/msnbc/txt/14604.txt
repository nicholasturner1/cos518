               Governor,

               Here is all the info on tomorrow 's event, as well as your remarks . Kris will hand -deliver your briefing packet to you
               tonight. The seniors are very excited to see you at the event - one, a retired nurse and professing Democrat,
               said she loved you so much , she even voted for you@

               A few things to be aware of

                 1. The Senior Center will be presenting you with a gift at the end of your speech , and I suspect it was made
                    by seniors . So linger a little, as it may take them a little extra time to make it to the podium@
                 2. You will be leaving the event before its conclusion (it is a TWO HOUR LONG EVENT ), and the event
                    sponsors are aware and very much understand. They will explain at the beginning of the event that you,
                    Commissioner Jackson , and Mayor Begich will all be leaving after your remarks are finished.
                 3. My suggestion is that you open the gift in front of the seniors , thank them, and then exit the room to your
                    left, shaking seniors' hands as you pass by . You should be able to get in and out , especially as Mayor
                    Begich is speaking directly after you; the seniors are SO excited that you 're coming.

               That's all for now. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance . Thanks!
