           Subject:                Wooten


           As confirmed in Molly's attorney file (Bobby Irwin), there have been NO complaints filed
           by the Heath or Palin family, Jason Moore stated we filed 15 complaints and only three
           were substantiated. KTVA claimed we filed 36 complaints! And John Cyr stumbled on that
           question with dead silence when he was asked about it... There have been no formal
           complaints.

              If Walt tries to go there, my response is "nice try", he can try to deflect from the
           reasons he was let go by blaming it on the Wooten issue, but he knows it's not true and
           perhaps he doesn't want a public discussion about his administrative skills being made
           public.
