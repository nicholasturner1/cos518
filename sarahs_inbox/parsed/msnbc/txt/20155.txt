           He did say "yay" to our gasline. Pretty cool. Wrong candidate.

           I've been monitoring the 'net to see what he says today (TC folks have

           been working on his campaign people and were hoping/expecting him to say

           something positive about the Legislature's action).



           I'm on it.

           He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole

           out Energy Rebate $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking

           points, etc. So.... we need to take advantage of this a write a

           statement saying he's right on. (Glad he's flipflopping on OCS, too.)

           Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction" to

           some of Obama's good points this morning?
