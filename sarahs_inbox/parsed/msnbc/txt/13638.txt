           I think janice said the focus is on energy- these guys want to know about our resources,
           it's not the educ/ethics kinda crowd.

           We're finishing up your remarks for the Governors meeting in Texas. You

           have two sets of remarks -- one is a 15-minute speech and the other is a

           three-minute overview of accomplishments and happenings in your state.

           On the three minute remarks, we focused on AGIA, ethics and education.

           Would you like to include anything else , or have us change the focus?
