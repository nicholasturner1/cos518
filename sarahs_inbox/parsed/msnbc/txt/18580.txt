         Subject:                  Glen B


         The last time I spoke with Glen, he expressed no displeasure with any of your policies and
         commented that he thought you should be governor for eight years. I was completely
         surprised to read about his performance on the Fagan show. So, bottom line, nothing I can
         figure from my conversation with him would have precipitated the exchange with Fagan.
