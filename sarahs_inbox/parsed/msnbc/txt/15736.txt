               Governor-

               Kyle Hopkins would like 10 minutes with you tomorrow to talk about the Knik Arm Bridge. He
               spoke with Randy about where the project stands now. He would like to ask you about how you see
               the project fitting into Alaska's future . It sounds like it is a pretty long feature that will run this
               weekend . Please let me know if I can schedule this.
