           Forgey is not answering the phone. I will be driving out to the Juneau Empire and talking
           to him.

           In the meantime, he needs to be called on his mistakes/omissions in his lastest reports,
           esp the facts left out in the Juneau Rd story that Randy pointed out this morning. It's
           not so much making a stink as it is "educating" him... we've had to learn too many lessons
           these past two years re: reporters, bloggers, radio hosts, etc getting it WRONG and we
           haven't had the means to stay on top of their mistakes and untruths... but with more
           people on board now we will make a greater effort to correct their mistakes. This is the
           right and fair thing to do for Alaskans so our constituents aren't led to believe

           If we make a big stink with either he or his editors, we only make it worse. We do need to
           develop some long-term strategies at improving our relationship with him - to do whatever
           we can. I'd be happy to spend time with him when we're in Juneau. Not sure if the issue is
           he has an ax to grind or he's incompetent.

           Mal claims Forgey's story left out a lot of what he said to him. How do we deal with this
           guy and a newspaper editor that seems more than content to let poorly written and

            Leo & Frank,




            For the record , today's Juneau Empire reported only half of what I said. What I said was,
            The permit is in its final stages. When received we will go to the commissioner with the
            permit and the project status and ask for direction . We do have the first segment ready to
            bid. He asked if that was a 23 mile segment and I said a 5 mile segment. He asked if it
            was to " draw" the expected law suit and I replied it could be.



            None of what he asked Reuben or I on costs , either roads or ferries , was, used.
