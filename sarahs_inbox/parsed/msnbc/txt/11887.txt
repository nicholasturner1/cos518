               Dear Governor Palin, Texas has acknowledged and thanked us for our support . A press release is something
               of an issue. I have been in contact with Sharon but the problem is that Texas has not released their brief to the
               press because they are still gathering support (like our endorsement) from other states and will probably tweak
               the brief before they file it and release it themselves . We should not release their brief before it is final or
               released by the author. It is clear that we are on board . I will be back in touch with Sharon after I hear more
               from Texas about how they feel about a press release . In any event, we are on board . Thanks Tails

               As you can see below, Texas has received our endorsement. (I will follow up with them regarding an answer to
               my separate inquiry about a press release.)

                Dear Deputy Solicitor General Jordan,



                The Attorney General has read your brief and both he and our governor are in full support of your position and
                wish to join it.




                Our AG should appear as:




                TALIS J. COLBERG

                Attorney General of Alaska

                P.O. Box 110300

                Juneau, Alaska 99811




                We greatly appreciate your excellent work on this issue of great importance . Indeed, this case has attracted a
                great deal of interest and attention in Alaska , so much so that we would like to issue a press release
                announcing that Alaska is joining your compelling brief . I assume that you would have no objection to such a
                press release, but I wanted to ask the separate question of whether you would have concerns or objections to
                our making such an announcement before you actually file the brief on Monday or issue your own statement.
                Obviously, in such a scenario we would not release the draft you circulated, we would just reference your
                general position and express our strong support. Alaskans, like Texans, are especially interested in this
                matter and Alaskans are eager to have our assurances that Alaska is standing with Texas and the "XX" other
                states to defend their individual rights.

                 Thank you for your consideration of this inquiry . And once again , we are very pleased to be joining your brief.



                (On an entirely mundane note, I believe I saw a typo on p. 22. In the first sentence of the last paragraph, "and"
                should probably be "had".)
