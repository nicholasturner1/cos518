            Governor Palin,




            I am a high school teacher as well as a retired member of the United States Army. Even
            way down here in the deep south, we have heard your name, along with our own Governor
            mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate. I have not seen your name on any of
            the recent "short lists", however I think you could do alot for the Republican Party and
            would be an outstanding chice. Is this within the realm of Possibility?



            God Bless!

            Everyone has to be on the same page on this before I'm brought in so I'm not in any kind
            of mediating, "in-between" position. So, until the whole team is wholly on board with
            whatever the plan is, I'll stay out of the circle and wait until all experts hash it out.

            Governor, I just got out of a meeting with Commissioners Irwin & Galvin,

            Marty, Bruce, Meg and Joe. They have a communications plan they want to

            roll out to you ASAP that involved a phone call, tomorrow, to the

            national presidential campaigns.



            I would like to talk to you about this at your convenience, Governor.
