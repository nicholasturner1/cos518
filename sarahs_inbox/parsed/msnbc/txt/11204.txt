             I bet McCallister or Quinn would want to scoop something like this . . . provide them the
             original transmittal letter from dec., show the original BASIS meeting time for the senate
             to convene ( 1:00pm ). I mean if you look at the flippin flight sched for Jnu-8 , 1,3,7. What
             do you mean members couldn ' t get here in time? Nobody took the 3 o'clock milk run and
             nobody is on the evening flight.

             Anyway, you're going to do awesome tonight, that's all that matters.

             Well you've said it before : means nothing to have internal meetings where we decide how
             right we are , but then fail to get the word out by every means possible.

             Some in the office aren't real aggressive about ever setting the record straight and
             putting their foot down , are they? Drives me nuts . Thanks for helping on this- it ' s crazy
             that we're blamed for " squabbling ". We know that we know that we know we didn't do
             anything wrong here.

            it would be great if Russ or Mike gave an accurate account of what happened to the media.
            Especially since they have been the ones dealing with harris and green on this .       Bitney's
             (intentional ) screw up ( the fact that he gave a - late - memo with the wrong time ... hmmm),
            Lyda's lies, bogus flights excuse , etc.    Harris quoted saying he is caught in the middle.
            Well Bitney put him there.



            Sorry to add but this whole thing, UGH. I'm also sorry you're having to deal w/this crap.
            Whats important is that all of us around the state will be watching you kick butt,
            cheering you on!

             It will be interesting to see who couldn't make it in for the already-scheduled 1:00 gavel
             time. She's full of bull, Just like she was last week on the fund raiser invitation. Just
             like she was on MatMaid " assistance ", just like she was on telling reporters I was gone
             "for many weeks" at the beginning of last year' s session , etc etc etc. She needs to be
             called on her lies.

             Lyda changed their floor session this afternoon... supposedly for those who couldn't fly in
             on time for 1:00 p.m. In reality, it was one more chance for her to complicate things.

              Yep- the "prime time" for media was never a factor. And I doubted that anyone "refused to
             give a reason"... it's not like I was ashamed of my son's graduation and would hide it.



              But at what point did Lyda change the gavel- in time from 1:00 to 6:00? Just today?
             Who's she waiting on?

              Governor,

               Bitney said they had a problem with it last week, but then Harris changed his mind and
             said 6 : 00 was o .k. In the meantime Bitney still sent the 7:00 invite to the Senate. That
             put this all in motion, because Lyda had all she needed for ammo .   The question remains,
             why should you change your travel after 6:00 was already approved a month ago?



               We NEVER refused to provide a reason for 6:00. When they asked, we told them. Bitney
             pretended he needed a reason for 6:00 because he thought it might make us sweat. He then
             admitted he knew about the graduation all along. He had told Tkacz early last week.



               I've been consistent since last week (when Tkacz was the first one to say he knew about
             the graduation) that you had a flight to catch to go see your son graduate. I never said
             anything until it was obvious that the word was out.



               The only real bad part of the story is the quote about the prime time slot. This was
             never a factor as far a I was concerned. I'm not sure why that even came up. Never heard
             that was a consideration of ours. It seems to run counter to the explanation that we
             needed 6 :00 in order for you to catch a plane.

              ADN is reporting "we" knew the 6pm was going to be. a problem a week ago (I did not),
            leaving the impression I could have changed flights. Who knew it was a problem a week ago?

               Also says I "refused " to give a reason for wanting 6pm so both House and Senate said
             7pm. Who "refused " to give reasons ( unless Bitney is spreading this, to cover his butt for
             not working with his boss - Harris - on this back in December)?
