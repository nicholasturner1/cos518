Todd - The book was delivered here in the ANC office for Trig. I did not ever hear back from Patti or
Greg Winegar on meeting you at the Capstone Signing. I had given Greg your cell also. So, the
book is here in the ANC office - I just wanted to let you know that it has been received in the event
you see Greg at the event. Thanks, Janice
