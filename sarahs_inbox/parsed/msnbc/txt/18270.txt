         Dear Ms. Gibson:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

        Governor

          Dear Governor Palin,

               I want you to know that Sam and I support your cuts to the budget. We know that some
          people have gotten accustomed to having government ( taxpayer money ) support many things
          that are not set forth by the constitution and they may not be happy with the cuts you
          made - but you did the right thing.

          KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. You made two "supervoters" from the Kenai Peninsula very pleased
          with the budget cuts. Thanks.



                                           Susan and Sam Gibson
