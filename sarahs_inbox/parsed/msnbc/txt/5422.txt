        Dear Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles,             Today' s news slips from Lynn

        Castle include a story about the new USDA grants for a specialized dairy

        to be operated in part by Rob Wells .            This is part of the picture

        regarding Mat Maid.        With only six dairy farms in the Mat Valley, the

        federal grants to build a specialized dairy will create further pressure

        on Mat Maid. Talis
