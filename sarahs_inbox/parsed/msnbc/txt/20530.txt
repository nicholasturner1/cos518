               Yes, we'll get direct deposits out Sept 12. Those getting paper checks ("warrants") will get them
               around Oct 3, which is 6 weeks earlier than usual.

                     a certain date in order to make that payment?

              Know that I'm here to support you in any way that I can. I do apologize if my email before was more
              frustrating then it was helpful. : \\

              I'll continue to pray for wisdom, discernment and peace as you walk through this.

              You and Bristol have been on my heart. She's a smart, capable and caring gal- I'm proud of your
              daughter for taking on the responsibility- and do hope that she holds her head high and thoroughly enjoys
              the miracle of her child. Trig will have a little buddy to grow up with and Piper will be beside herself with
              joy!

              Although not what you had originally planned, but God has a way of making all things good - not always
              easy, but goodlll

              4 more days and Ryan gets his license back . :). We have good kids- too bad we just couldn 't control all

               It was only Kami Clark who went into the master bedroom and Todd 's office and she was only at each of the

               To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd floor.

             Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor's office computer folks and
             they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the
             time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned back to the house. All
             of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend. I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

               Got the bills then- does that mean DOR guarantees the Sept 12 date?

              Can't answer those questions- I'll ask kelly and bill and others who were told it's a done deal.

              l see the article this morning about PFD payments going out on September 12. Do we have legislation back from the
              legislature to make that deadline? Have we told the press that we need the engrossed bill sent to us by a certain date
              in order to make that payment?

     I
               Governor, attached below are Ed Fogel 's quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right
     {         away. Ruth is already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to
               decide the right course of action.

               We still feel that DEC. Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


               To: Tom, Marty,

               The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several
               specific examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25 ,000 appropriation, but also several other
               election statutes, and a 1992 AG's opinion . The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the
               ballot measure should have some level of agreement to our website.

               The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website
               language that is mutually agreeable , or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that
               they find objectionable. We have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm
               tomorrow. the Commission will either then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

               The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state
               officials cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at
               2:00. The Commission made no mention of the Governor 's statement at the press conference in their order.

              Ed
