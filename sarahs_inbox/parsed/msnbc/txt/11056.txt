                 Iditarod is closing in and still wondering if you are interested in riding my 2nd sled out of Anchorage?
                 The other option is an Iditarider which rides in the sled but is chosen by the highest bidder.all
                 proceeds go to Iditarod Please let us know ASAP and we can get into specifics or I can choose
                 some one other than yourself if you are unable. Lance
