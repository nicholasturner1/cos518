         Governor,



         Kevin Banks is working on a draft for all of us to read .       Bottom line I

         think drilling anywhere in Alaska shows this is a good place to be.

          BP sanctions Liberty development



          This morning BP said it has sanctioned development of its Liberty oil

                                                          4

          prospect, which is offshore northern Alaska in the Beaufort Sea.



          The $1.5 billion development plan for Liberty entails the drilling of

          six ultra-extended reach development wells from existing near-shore

          facilities at the Endicott satellite island under the Beaufort Sea to

          the Liberty reservoir, which is some five miles offshore the North

          Slope. The drilling'would involve horizontal departures of 34,000 to

          44,000 feet, requiring the use of a purpose-built rig that will be the

          largest land rig in the world, BP has said.



          Using the Endicott satellite island allows BP to produce Liberty without

          building a remote offshore island and pipeline infrastructure, thus

          significantly reducing the environmental impact of the new development.

          First production from Liberty is expected in 2011.



          BP expects to recover about 100 million barrels of oil from Liberty. The

          company has said the reservoir is "high quality with wells capable of

          delivering 15,000 barrels of oil per day or more initial production."



          Liberty was discovered by BP in 1997, and is one of the largest

          undeveloped light oil fields in the BP Alaska portfolio.



          The BP-operated Endicott field is east of Prudhoe Bay. It came online in

          1987 and was the world's first producing offshore Arctic oil field.

          Endicott is linked to shore with a 1.5-mile gravel causeway.
