             Subject: President's trip

             If the opportunity arises, I would suggest mentioning progress on the = gas pipeline to the
             President, although my guess is that this subject has = already occurred to you. You might also
             want to indicate your = support for the request made by 10 US Senators that the President =
             authorize seismic work in ANWR (see attached letter).

             My guess is that this request will be opposed by the national = environmental community on the
             grounds that seismic work is exploration, = and exploration is prohibited in ANWR without
             Congressional authorization.&= nbsp; But, a good argument can be made to the contrary based
             on = seismic work done previously.

             In my opinion, mention of these two subjects would have both = substantive and political value,
             as you will undoubted be asked by the = media what you mentioned to the President.

             On another subject, Governor Schweitzer of Montana has also approved = the theme for the
             NGA Natural Resources Committee - Energy Infrastructure.&= nbsp; So, we will proceed with
             NGA and his staff on that basis in light of = your approval last week.

             I hope you enjoy your interaction with the President.
