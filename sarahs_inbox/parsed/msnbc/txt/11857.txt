             Governor:



             I spoke with Leo and central region director Gordon Keith last night and

             this morning after cabinet.        Gordon meets with Mr. Abbot, (the public

             works person for MOA) once a month. Gordon said this topic will be

            discussed at the next meeting in about 3 weeks .               They will also discuss

            the brick pedestrian crossing the Mayor wants .            I will follow up with

            both Leo and Gordon after that meeting.



            Thanks



            Randy



            Katie:
