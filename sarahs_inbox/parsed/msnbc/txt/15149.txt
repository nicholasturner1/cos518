            Hi Governor Palin, congrajulations on your new baby. God bless your child and thanks for
            working hard to keep the State of Alaska in great shape. I hope that you help us here in
            Juneau. I have six children and our three jobs are not enough to buy the clothes because
            all the money goes on food and gasoline and now aelp is over charging us. Please help us.
            Thanks again you have my vote and support for your other 6 years of governor.
