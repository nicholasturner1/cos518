                Dear Ms. Rosso:

                Thank you for your email. I certainly understand your concern for the impact of high energy costs on school
                budgets. The legislature did include some additional funds for school districts in the recently passed budget to
                help with these costs. Governor Palin's resource rebate legislation and several other ideas are being debated by
                legislators in special session. You may wish to provide testimony to the House or Senate Finance Committees or
                to your district legislator regarding energy costs for school districts.

                This issue is of vital importance to all Alaskans . We are hopeful that there will be some relief provided during this
                special session as we work on long-term solutions to bring down the cost of energy in our state . Thank you again
                for writing.

                Karen Rehfeld

                Subject: energy rebate suggestion

                I ask that you consider the energy rebates for all children age 16 and under be given to local school
                districts. School districts must receive energy assistance. School district budgets have been hit hard by
                gas and diesel increases.

                Consider that rural school districts are paying $5+ a gallon for fuel to run the generators that power the
                lights and heat for the village or town school. Schools also serve as community centers. Generators
                must run twelve hours a day minimum usually.

                Consider that the larger school districts like Anchorage, Fairbanks, Mat-Su and Juneau transport
                students over many road miles. Utility costs have also increased. The energy cost is now way over
                what districts originally budgeted.

                A family with four children needs assistance for their schools. Do they need four rebates all to the same
                household, or could the rebates be more effective at the school level? Setting the age at 16, allows for
                rebates to go to 17 or 18 year olds who may be driving, or who may even be working.

              If school districts do not receive extra help, the added costs will reduce school budgets for educating our
              youth - and this is not acceptable.

              Thank you for your leadership on this,
