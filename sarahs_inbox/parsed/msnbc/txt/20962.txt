          Shoot - that's horrible. Thanks for the head's up - we no doubt will know him, or someone
          who knows him.

         Gov,



          I just received a call from Cam Toohey at Shell regarding an incident that occurred over
         the weekend.  It resulted in the death of a sincontractor's employee, Kirk Shivley of
         Wasilla.



          The incident occurred on the Kulliq drill ship that's in Canada right now.



          I believe that the DC shop for Shell is going to be speaking with Katz about it, too.



          Joe

                No big deal, but I didn't know we were behind, according to him.

               Don't mind Jeff questioning me, just hate for anything to reflect on you . His process is unique . Just so
               you know timeline that we discussed this morning:
               His nominating committee convenes Oct 11th, they set up strategy for accepting ads which will run
               through end of Oct. They'll interview candidates (include the ones we have and will give them) and be
               ready to get with us early December. We can appoint prior to session . He has Privil s name.

              meeting on Friday . I'm so glad to hear we're all on the same page there in recognizing it's long overdue to change
              some structure and bring in new energy to address the huge energy needs in Alaska.

                       Bruce Anders and Marty Rutherford are also working on a plan to address comprehensive energy needs
              throughout AK. I'm ccing them so they're in the loop also.

                       I'll be out of pocket for a few hours as I do two speeches in the Valley , then Anchorage, but feel free to
              email and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

                        Thanks for helping on this. I 'll cc Mike also so you two can communicate on this.

                        I sincerely appreciate your passion on this Emil. Thanks for moving forward.
