              Very sad. Very sad for the innocent who had their livelihoods washed away.



             And it is "justice delayed is justice denied" considering the passing of thousands of
             litigants... while Exxon plugs along with its masterful litigation.



             Thanks for letting us know.



             Sharon- we'll no doubt be asked about this today, so send the reporters my way. Thank you

             Subject: Exxon/US Supreme Court




             I just heard that the US Supreme Court has accepted Exxon's appeal of some , but not all,
             of the issues raised in the cert petition filed by Exxon.

       {
             The three questions are:




             * Can a ship owner be held liable for damages in the circumstances of this case, where
             much has been done to prevent the type of behavior which caused the accident?

             * Can the courts create a judge-made remedy of punitive damages in the Clean Water Act
             when the statute does not specifically provide for such damages?

                                                                    1




                                                                                                                     PRA_GSP01_0007157

             * Does the damage award fit within the limits of maritime law? The court is refusing to
             hear the question of whether the damage award amounted to a denial of due process, per
             other recent cases.



             So, the saga continues.  The first two questions seem to raise issues of statutory
             construction, but the third might also involve the factual question of how much is allowed
             under the maritime laws. In these circumstances, it is not hard to visualize litigation
             that will continue for quite some time.



              I read somewhere that over 25$ of the original plaintiffs have died. Therefore, this may
              truly be an instance of justice delayed is justice denied.



              I think that Exxon is better at this kind of litigation than almost any litigant I've
              seen.                                         _
