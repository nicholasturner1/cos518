              Good morning Governor,

              I understand you may be headed out of Juneau this evening. If that is the case, it looks like we may need your
              signature on two proclamations late this afternoon. Dept of Law is drafting the language which would amend the
              call to include changes the Legislature has made to the energy bills.

             My guess is that after 2pm we will have the finals ready for signature. Someone can run them to the residence for
             your signature and then we will hold them in our office and only submit once we know what the final legislation will
             include.

             Will this work for you?

             Thanks, Kelly
