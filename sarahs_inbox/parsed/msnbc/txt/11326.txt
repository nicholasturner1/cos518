                  Subject: Passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones -

                Governor -
               Nick Begich just called to let us know about the passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones , the last native speaker of the
               Eyak language. She was 89 years old. Mr. Begich ' s wife is Sheila Slate who is the adopted daughter of Chief
               Smith. Sheila and Chief Jones met the Governor at an event at the Alaska Native Heritage center just a month or
               two ago . Chief Slate thought the world of the Governor, and so her family just wanted to let the Governor know of
               her passing . The funeral is this Friday, with a viewing from 1 lam-fpm and funeral service at 1 :00. Then they'll
               have the traditional potlatch after 40 days.

               Note: We have short staff in ANC so I don't know if we want Colleen or I can check w/Lt. Governor on attending
               this service . Privileged or Personal Material so we will be down to Abbey , Colleen in office on Thursday and
               Friday - 01. 24, 01.25. 1 Thanks, J anice
