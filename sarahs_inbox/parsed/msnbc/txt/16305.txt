               Dear Gov.,



               My name is Diwata Fager and I'm the mother of Charlene Bernardo,you've met my daughter
               Charlene last December at the Dimond Walmart,you shopped with us(you have your daughter
               with you).My daughter have the brain cancer.?Maybe you'll remember her from
               that.Well,anyway,my daughter's cancer spread to her spine and lungs now and we're her in
               Seattle for more treatments, and I'm writting to you for some financial help.I try to
               contact our case worker for our foodstamps but no answer.I've been trying to get a hold of
               someone for the past month now and no answer.My husband and I quit working to be with our
               daughter as much as we can, to spend quality tome with her and so as her brother and
               sister,make her happy as can be. But we can't help to also think that we have some
               financial responsibility as well and that's the reason why I am writing to you,maybe
               there's some asistance for housing(rent payment) and maybe food asistance as well.I would
               really appreciate anything at this point.I really d

               on't want to write about something so I would say stupid like this because I know you have
               more important stuff to take care and do but this is the only way I could think of.Again
               sorry for taking up some of your time but I also thank you.
