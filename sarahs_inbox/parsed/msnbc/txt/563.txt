Hey Meg,



Weather permitting, Jason Moore can visit our site

Friday morning and ASMI could stop buy in the

afternoon.



The site is about three miles down the beach from

where we launch our skiff, it's a short ride.




If you have any questions please email or

call 842-2460.




Thanks Todd
