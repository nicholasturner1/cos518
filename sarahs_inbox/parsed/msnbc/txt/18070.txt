         We have so many on our list of people who want to help - let me ask kris or mike and/or
         others to help. Go through that list to plug in people who have been very supportive, want
         to stay supportive, but many may be losing patience as we dont tap into that support base.

         Governor Palin wanted me to ask you if you can recommend anyone working

         in

         higher education that would be a good fit, for the Community Service

         Commission.      The function of the board is to develop the statewide

         community

         service plan, and award federal grants to state non-profits.
