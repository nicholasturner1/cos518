           Budget expected to glide through

           ON TO THE HOUSE :        Supplemental measure adds up to $4 .3 billion.




           By ANNE SUTTON

           The Associated Press



            ( 03/08 / 08 03 :11:28)



           JUNEAU -- A $4 . 3 billion supplemental budget is expected to move quickly through the
           Legislature despite its prodigious bulk and unconventional makeup, according to House and
           Senate leaders.



           The bill, scheduled for the House Finance Committee on Monday, covers more than
           unanticipated spending in the current fiscal year , which is what ' s typically found in a
           supplemental budget.



                                                                   1

           It left the Senate bearing a $3.6 billion savings plan , $ 180 million to cover three years
           of revenue sharing , $ 300 million in weatherization and energy efficiency rebates and $50
           million in capital projects that were vetoed by Gov. Sarah Palin last year.



           The last item has drawn sharp criticism from Palin , but finance committee co-chairman Rep.
           Kevin Meyer , R-Anchorage , said he doesn ' t expect that will delay the bill or jeopardize
           its other elements.



           "The supplemental is moving fast," Meyer said . "( Palin )    could choose to veto the capital
           items and everything else could still go forward."



           Meyer said the House committee does plan to swap out some of the Senate projects that may
           not meet Palin ' s guidelines for education , safety and transportation infrastructure
           improvements.



           Meyer said $ 300,000 for a Sitka ball field and $ 10,000 for a Fairbanks climbing wall
           probably would not survive House scrutiny . while a $10 million expansion of the Port of
           Anchorage and $1 . 4 million in Juneau airport safety improvements probably would.



           The list also includes traffic improvements in Anchorage , community center renovations in
           rural villages , computer lab upgrades at schools , and water and sewer improvements.



           House and Senate leaders have said they are in general agreement over other key elements
           of the bill , such as the savings plan , revenue sharing and weatherization grants.



           That bodes well for the more conventional items awaiting critical funding , such as $18.5
           million for senior benefits that lawmakers passed in special session last summer.



           Lawmakers approved income-based monthly payments of $125 to $250 for about 10,000 low-
           income seniors . They did not appropriate the money for it, however, leaving that task for
           the regular session.



           The state has made up the difference with money borrowed from the Adult Public Assistance
           Program . Now that program will be out of money by the end of the month , according to state
           officials.



           Funding for senior benefits , labor contracts and inmate health care are just a few of the
           governor ' s supplemental requests for the fiscal year that ends June 30.



           Meanwhile , the Senate Finance Committee will take up the House version of the state
           operating budget on Monday . Discussion of the capital budget is expected to begin later in
           the week.
