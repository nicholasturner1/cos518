             MESSAGE:

             I had dinner with Bob and Barb Bettisworth last night . Barb mentioned that she and Bob had
             both donated $500 to your campaign , and never received any sort of acknowledgement or
             thank you.




              I know that this must have been an oversight, because my husband donated a mere 25 dollars
              and received 3 different thank you notes.




             Bob is an old time Fairbanksan who served in the Alaska Legislature . I am sure you will
             want to thank them . Their number is 907 - 479-5283
