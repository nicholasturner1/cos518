             Yesterday would have been perfect. I'll look for events in places outside of southcentral
             as it's impt to get out of Anchorage for some of these.

            The bill sponsored by Sen Huggins has been transmitted to the Gov and in our possession.
            I'll work wl Comm Campbell to find a suitable event for this signing in the next 10 days
            and will get back to folks with ideas.   Kelly

             What event is being planned for recognizing our uniformed Alaskans who'll now receive the
            hunting / fishing licenses that we worked on this session ? These troops are worthy of a good
            event to announce the benefit they can receive.



             Pls let me know when and where we'll do this before their fishing season really kicks
            off. Thanks



             Also- Randy- any word on what happened yesterday with the missing proclamation at the Mem
            Day ceremony?
