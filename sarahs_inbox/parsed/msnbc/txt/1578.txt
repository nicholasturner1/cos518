  Subject: NGA Survey of FGOA attendance
  Hi Todd,

  If you'll let me know what you'd like to attend I'll fill out this survey for the NGA meeting. I've
  already sent your SSN, DOB and middle initial (hope it's M) for security clearance to attend the
  dinner with the President.

  Thanks!
  Erika

  Final Notes ( Please complete online survey re: attendance by Friday, February 16)
  To help the NGA staff in our preparations for the meeting, we are asking the favor of
  your time and assistance in completing a brief survey (click on link below), indicating the
  planned attendance (for you and your Governor's Spouse) for each of the Spouses'
  Program sessions.     Please note that all spouses' business sessions, including
  breakfasts and luncheons, are open to the spouses' accompanying staff. Because of
  the high security associated with the Spouses' Luncheon on Monday, February 26, with
  special guest First Lady Laura Bush, the U.S. Secret Service is requiring the personal
  data (Social Security # and Date of Birth) for each attendee. This information can be
  included in the survey form, which is protected and will be kept confidential.
