             I believe that because it would be considered a government to government gift I think we
             just have to report it under the ethics code. If there was some concern on the use of the
             plane as a gift to the state we could always reimburse them for it, I don't think we have
             to reimburse them. As for the cost to the state if we were to reimburse for using it,
             it would be calculated as a regular commercial fare per seat from Anchorage to Barrow. I
             will check with Linda and if that changes I will let you know.

             Did linda Perez say we'd have to pay for Barrow's jet to be allowed seats on it tomorrow?
             How much will it cost the state to reimburse them if we fly their aircraft?
