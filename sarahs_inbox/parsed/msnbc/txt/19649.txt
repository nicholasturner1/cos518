             Importance:              High


             We did not cut dps budget- if there were cuts, were they not made by leggies, as I have
             been told? Ktva reported that Admin cut the budget and has hurt troopers with our cuts.
             This needs to be corrected asap, Andrea Gustry was the reporter- theier story re-runs at
             l0pm. Pls let me know who's correcting it.

             Who talked to Hawker and told him that we would not answer his questions about wait? His
             quotes on the news were brutal.
