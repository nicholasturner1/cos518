          Hello everyone... pardon me for this late entry. I see that there were some ema ils I
                                                                                      ^_

          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            Thanks for everyone's flexibility and quick set-up - and a Copper River King, too!



           Thanks,

           My recommendation is that we invite Privileged or Personal Material   Redacted                      My
          rough count is 22 ppl. We could do it tonight at 5:30 or 6:00

            Great idea ! Please all decide what is best for AGIA .  But if time doesn ' t matter
          tonight is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.
          Again decide what is best for AGIA. Tom

             Cool! We should cook it for whomever needs to have that get-together / reception
          opportunity tonight, tomorrow, or wednesday . I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good
          opportunity to have folks over for informal gasline chat.
