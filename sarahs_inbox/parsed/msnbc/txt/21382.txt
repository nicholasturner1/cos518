              It would be like Kaia going out with one of your buddies a decade from now. That's how
              warped Ramras is in his personal life.

               Pat,

               Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
              committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
              guys anyway I can!
