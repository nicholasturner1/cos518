          Ok let's add to your agenda while you're up: would you meet with Sharon and Beth (Meg
          isn't back from baby yet) and we can get a refresher on when to jump, when to chill.



          If our offices are full, camp out in my office. I have the conference table.

          Actually, I will be in Anchorage this week for some personal stuff (two crowns and a panel
          discussion on my former life as an ombudsman investigator). I'll be in town late Wednesday
          night through early Sunday morning. I believe I'll be in the office at 11 a.m. Thursday to
          participate in a phone meeting with Katz and the lieutenant governor and aviation issues.\

          I'm in New Orleans for IOGCC. Rick Perry relinquished his chairmanship and I inherited.
          I'll type more later.



          When are you coming up?
