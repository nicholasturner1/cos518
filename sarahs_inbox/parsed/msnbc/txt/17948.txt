         Subject:                  GOVERNOR END OF SESSION SPEECH


         Attached is the proposed speech for the press conference tomorrow,

         tentatively scheduled for Liam.           Please look through and provide any

         input as quickly as possible. I believe it reflects a conversation

         with Karen, Sharon, and Chris post press availability early this

         morning.



         I have a meeting with gasline members at 8am and will not be available

         until 9am. Unless you are the Governor, please only make factual

         changes at this point, as everyone most assuredly would have other

         changes as well.



         I've added a few possible Q&As at the bottom - if they need amending,

         let me know. Any changes that you make and forward, please cc: all so

         that we know what's been said and we don't have numerous versions out

         there.



         Thank you!

         Meg
