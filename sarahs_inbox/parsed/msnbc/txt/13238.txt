             From talking to Sharon, she is pretty confident that Sheila could do it in an effective
             manner. I agree.

             That helps anyway. Thanks. She can handle it light-heartidly, knowing her column... and
             maybe it would go a long way. I wish I could shame people into ceasing such gossip about a
                                                                  1

             If we're going to do anything else on this, the only place I would recommend is in Sheila
             Toomey's column.

            Am I hearing right on Fagan?. He is disspelling rumors about Trig and chastising hate
            mongers. Wow. Said the Governor's office is flooded with calls about rumors.

            Hate to pick at this one again, but have heard three different times today the rumor again
            the Bristol is pregnant or had this baby. Even at Trig' s doc appt this morning his doc
            said that's out there (hopefully NOT in their medical community-world, but it's out
            there). Bristol called again this afternoon asking if there's anything we can do to stop
            this, as she received two girlfriend-type calls today asking if it were true. Sent from my
