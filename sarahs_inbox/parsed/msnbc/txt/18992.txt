         I will get these things set up .   I spoke with the Juneau Coach and they will not know the
         team until this Sat. evening .   It will be either Wasilla , Colony, or North Pole . He will
         let me know.



         NEA will be set up on Oct. 1 as Bill Bjork is out of state through the end of this week.



         I will send up the letter of endorsement that was drafted here in Juneau to Kris and it
         can be run out for your approval/signature.



         When you know what flight times you would all like please let me know. Thanks, Janice

          Who's Juneau playing? Dinner on friday sounds good. ATIA speech should be short and sweet
          - we've disagreed on cruise taxes and they're not super fond of our admin (but we can talk
          about attracting tourists and changing our image).



         HUB sounds good. We"ll do the letter.



         We also still need to sched NEA leaders who've been asking for mtg.

         Governor - I spoke with the Juneau Football Coach - Bill Chalmers this afternoon. Mr.
         Chalmers would like you and the family to be the "Honorary Coaches" for the Saturday
         evening 8:00 pm. play off game. You would all be recognized and be able to stand at the
         side lines with the coaches.  Mr. Chalmers also asked if the dinner could be Friday night
         instead of Thursday.  We would like to bring you down on Thursday so that you could speak
         to the Alaska Travel Industry Association Annual Convention. I am asking for an afternoon
         speaking time.  This includes 500 Tourism Leaders throughout the state. Friday would be
         meetings here in the Juneau office with the football dinner that evening from 7:30 p.m. -
         8:30 p.m. at the Mansion. Saturday would be the play-off game. Then Sunday you would
         travel back to Anchorage on morning or afternoon flight. Another family consideration for
         Juneau would be to view the HUB youth center. Pastor Rose is asking for a letter of
         endorsement for the HUB project, to be used in their fund raising efforts. (We have one
         drafted for you). Thank you for your consideration, Janice
