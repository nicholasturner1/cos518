           MESSAGE:

           I reside in North Carolina but admire you and what you stand for. I'd love to see you one
           day consider running for president. I know rumors are abundant about a possibility of you
           being John McCain's running mate. We need strong republicans in the white house. My
           biggest fear is he might not pick someone who will guarantee votes but when I heard you
           were a consideration my fears were diminished somewhat. I know you recently gave birth to
           a wonderful little person who needs you more than ever right now. I just hope whoever
           McCain's running mate is will have a similar platform to yours. Hugs from an RN, busy mom
           of 3, wife to a busy orthopedist! Gina Rowan
