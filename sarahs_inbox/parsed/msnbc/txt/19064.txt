         Walt- could you provide me any documentation regarding the state's settlement of Trooper
         Spitzer's case (I saw it on the news last night - I hadn't even known that this trooper
         was in trouble again. He's the same one who was stationed in the valley and had a bad
         reputation along with his fellow trooper whom we've talked about before, and this is at
         least the second public case involving Spitzer and allegations of his abuse of power).



         What I need is just the factual info that proves this was a DPS issue and I was not a part
         of any settlement. I was not advised, nor requested to participate in this... as is the
         appropriate way of handling such a case. I ask because I've already heard the accusation
         that "I" settled with a bad cop.



         I'd like to explain factually what an elected official's role is in cases like this (that
         being, I had no role in this).

         Thank you.
