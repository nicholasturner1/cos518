              Governor,

              As I mentioned earlier, Bob will have your briefing booklet waiting for you in your car when you get into Anchorage
              this evening, but I'm sending this to you as back-up. I've printed your remarks onto cards for you in both 12 and
              14 point options, as well as on a single page , just in case. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to
              call or email me. As I'll be staffing you at the event, I'll look forward to seeing you Sunday(

              Have a good weekend,

              Kate
