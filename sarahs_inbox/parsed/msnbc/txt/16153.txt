           Governors Urge Congress to Support Energy Security Programs




           June 17, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin and Governor Joe

           Manchin III of West Virginia are urging Congress to support

           federal-state programs that assist states in promoting energy security.

           Governor Manchin is chair of the Natural Resources Committee for the

           National Governors Association, and Governor Palin serves as vice chair.




                                                                 1

            Given recent energy price increases and projected long-term growth in

            energy demand, both governors are calling on Congress to support efforts

            to conserve energy resources while actively seeking to diversify

            supplies by expanding renewable resources.




            In a joint letter, Governors Palin and Manchin urged members of the

            House and Senate Appropriations Committees to fully fund the Energy

            Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.




            "We can't afford to just talk about energy security," said Governor

            Palin.    "In these uncertain economic times , states must leverage

            investments to promote efficient renewable energy projects."



            The National Governors Association promotes visionary state leadership,

            shares best practices and speaks with a unified voice on national

            policy.    Its members are the governors of the 50 states and five

            territories.
