             Web mail from: Ms. Deb Bydlon

             MESSAGE:

             Dear Ms . Palin,



             I am an Alaskan mom with 5 children , and I am writing to urge you to officially endorse
             Mike Huckabee , Former Governor of Arkansas , for President.




             Governor Huckabee is and always has been staunchly pro-life. He is the most consistently
             and fervently pro-life candidate in the race. He believes that Roe v. Wade should be
             overturned. He is opposed to research on embryonic stem cells. He supports a Human Life
             Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and he passed pro-life legislation
             while governor of Arkansas.
                                                                      1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01 0010458

             In addition, he has calmed fears about his electability. Finishing first in Iowa, third in
             New Hampshire, third in Michigan, and a very close second in South Carolina, he has
             clearly proven to be one of the main contenders for the Republican nomination.
             Furthermore, he is either leading or competitive in the polls of numerous states which
             vote on Super Tuesday.



             With the constraints of a modest budget and a lack of inherent name        recognition, Governor
             Huckabee would benefit tremendously from your support. Moreover, as        Super Tuesday
             approaches quickly, when over twenty states, including Alaska, will        choose their
             candidates on the same day, Governor Huckabee needs as much national       media coverage as
             possible. You could greatly assist in this area with an announcement       of your endorsement.



             Thank you for your time. I sincerely hope that you will choose to endorse Governor Mike
             Huckabee for President of the United States.
