                  Ref: My opologies;
                  I forgot to include the dates of the currently held reservations for the Marston Theater when i
                  sent the comments and request for you to -have your staff or another agency host,hold, and make
                  happen, an Energy Forum for public participation to be conducted here in Anchorage while you
                  were visiting the rural areas in prepartion to your return to Anchorage and subsequent anticipated
                  meeting-s..

                  A reminder; The Marston has a direct live video feed hookup to GCI cable control room and
                  these hookups are not located just anywhere.

                  The Marston is reserved for May 8,9, and the 10 and he needs to be notified pretty soon, say mon
                  or tuesday of this next week to hold those dates.

                  May 8, thursday 7 am to 5pm
                  May 9, friday    7 am to 5pm
                  May 10, saturday 7 am to 12 noon

                  Those were the only real dates that were not all chewed up or unavailable. They may have some
                  mechanism for holding availability that i am not aware of.. this is not uncommon in the
                  business ,, i think,,,

                  Well, again my opologies for the omission..

                  Thank You,

                  Paul D. Kendall
