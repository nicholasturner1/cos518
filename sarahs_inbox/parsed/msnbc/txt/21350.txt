              Mike- i'll need you to travel to sitka to meet with the mayor (and any other community
              leaders) to hear their serious concerns about the ferries. Again, as I explained when Beth
              and I returned, it was unexpected (and inexcusable) to have been bombarded with the
              residents' concerns expressed everywhere we went.



              It would be good for you to get out and about Alaska anyway! And since it's just a puddle
              jump over there I ask you (I'il have Janice do so) to schedule in the next couple of days
              a visit to discuss with sitka all of their concerns. (It's ok that their leggies won't be
              there... Randy and Russ can follow up with leggies.)



              There are any issues we can't keep putting off - this is one of them.



             Thanks mike, appreciate you doing this and look forward to giving you more opportunties to
             travel to other areas , as you can tell it's impossible for me to be everywhere at once and
             you can step in on some of these. Thanks!
