             I had a veteran approach me today and ask where you were Thursday. I didn't

             say anything except to inquire further about why he was asking. He said that

             you were listed on a program and invite at a Lions Club conference or event

             on Thursday to give Welcoming remarks, perhaps in the Valley??? Not sure how

             they didn't get regrets or have someone from the group stand up and

             acknowledge that you weren't able to make it, but thought I'd pass this

             along to you.
