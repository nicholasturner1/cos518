          Message:"Dear Gov. Palin,




          I am protesting your cut of &quot;the Anchorage Covenant House expansion -- $1.1
          million&quot; and putting in &quot;UAA sports arena planning and design -- $15 million.
          &quot; This doesn't make sense at all.



          Why are you investing $15 million into the UAA Sports arena and taking away more potential
          rooms for homeless teens? How do you sleep at night knowing you're probably leaving a lot
          of homeless teens in Anchorage homeless in the cold? Please re-instate the $1.1 million
          for the Covenant House expansion.



          Thank you




                                                                1
