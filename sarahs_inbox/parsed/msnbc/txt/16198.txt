             Governor,




             Joe and I just got off an energy phone call and issues have surfaced we need to speak to
             you about ASAP.  We know you are headed to Juneau tomorrow so figured today might be our
             shot to see you.



             Pls let me know - we are still at the ofc. Thank you.
