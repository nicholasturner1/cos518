Your address tomorrow could be a great platform to thank the House for their understanding.. let
them know you look forward to working with them ...it could just be something informal before you
begin-kind of a shot over the bow making the other body and their leader look foolish and petty.

Good! This is so wrong . Petty, petty politics at play...which will come back to bite. Said on the news
that the reason she is giving is not all will be there in time . How does that make any sense with one
hours difference and flight schedules ? I like Frank's idea of sending the senate a DVD copy. :)

What next? What a way to kick things off...



I really cannot believe this situation. I pray that what the enemy means for evil, will turn out for good.
