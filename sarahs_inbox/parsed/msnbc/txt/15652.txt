             Kris- if you read the article this morning you'll see something's fishy about it be the
             creamery claims it' s'success is due to Lyda's support- and everyone under the sun was
             there at the grand opening incl Stevens, Young, local elected officials, etc. Are we sure
             we didn't get any invitation to attend?

            Weeks ago I had emailed franci and others offering our support at the new creamery's grand
            opening - we'd cut the ribbon or whatever - I see in adn they already did it. Did Beus or
            anyone ever invite us to kick this off for them?
