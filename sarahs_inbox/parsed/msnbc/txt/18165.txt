             Subject: Swan Lake Intertie
             Just got off the phone with Commissioner Irwin. He's going to bring it up at the Cabinet
             meeting, but thought I would pass along as well right now. The two Senators in our
             Congressional delegation asked to pass a message along to the Governor asking to preserve
             the $46m funding for Swan Lake Intertie and not veto it or any portion of it. Supposedly,
             they've been inundated in D.C. with Alaska visitors asking for the full $46m as well. I
             mentioned to Irwin that with Swan Lake - one thought process Is that if the project will take
             many years, perhaps funding could be spread out over time. He said that he heard that
             perhaps the concern is that the price tag will be more than originally estimated.

             Thanks,
             Meg
