             Governor and. Mike,

             Just a followup to my prior email before the next Gov health initiative working group
             meets regarding funding parameters for spending on a Gov's health initiative for a FY2010
             roll out? I need to communicate the general funding parameters to the working group at
             our Wed meeting.  Dr. Butler is the primary working on this with me and others.



             Please advise.     Thanks Anna
