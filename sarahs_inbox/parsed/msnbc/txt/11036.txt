              Not through me. She is unbelievable. Her cat must have forgot to pass it along.

             Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
             again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
             lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
