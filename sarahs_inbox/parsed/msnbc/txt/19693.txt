            until it was essentially too late. That's why we need tro hustle now. Thanks

                From my understanding Randy has incorporated her comments /tone and prepared another draft since then . The deadline was
                missed, but Sharon said she thought this was taken care of before she left Anchorage so I've asked her to clear up the cluster
                w/Rosanne (and Meg Holland). We will get the polished statement to Meg tomorrow . Again, sorry as I was just venting
                about how all this went down and no matter how much I tried to resolve and help - it was still a cluster.

               Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt , and his claim that it was only four.
                I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception , every trip, phone call and face -to-face that I had with
               Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                 Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                 Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS , Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER
               refused any request to meet with any of us. He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in
               "communications" with me.
                Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.

               My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a press
               conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with
               him? If there are any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.
                 He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good Alaskans say that
               this is NOT a good situation he's in.

              Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and his claim that it was only four.
               I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone call and face-to-face that I had with
              Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER
              refused any request to meet with any of us. He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in
              "communications" with me.
               Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.
              And pis pass on the Bill McA. What's his email addy?
                Janice- pis look through sched to prove these points. Thanks

              I just talked to holland on phone, essentially quoted Meg's statement and incorporated randy's
              points - she says she'll try to get it on line... pray that it goes in the paper too (she doubted that)-
              she was shocked to hear of cabinet meetings, three trips sitting by him to rural communities, etc.
              He insists it was four times in 17 months. I restated that I and cos, dep cos and sp assist Randy
              also spoke with him about direction we wanted to go w recruits, alcohol, etc i-
              RESULTS/ACTION not just "plans".

               But she did NOT have my answers. That's the difference. What's megan's phone number?

               Don't mean to sound sharp , but no one let me know of this issue, nor any press deadline until it was essentially too
               late. That's why we need tro hustle now. Thanks
