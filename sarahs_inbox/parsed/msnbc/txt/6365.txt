        Let me know if you'd like a rewrite and what direction a rewrite should take . Thanks!




       On another picnic-related note , for future reference , I noticed that the governor referred
       to borough assembly person Lynne " Wood" in her comments . Her last name is "Woods ." Also,
       "brigadier" (as in brigadier general ) is pronounced with a hard G, as in " brig ", not with
       a soft G, as in "bridge".

       Mark,




       Can you please draft a letter of response from Governor Palin to the Burgess letter to the
       editor in today's ADN? Below is a response from Cheryl Metiva who is submitting. I've
       also asked that Bert Hall respond as well.
                                                        3

         In response to the editorial by Pat Burgess in the ADN:




        Please rest assured that Governor Palin , her staff or the many volunteers who facilitated
        the Mat-Su Governor ' s picnic did not arrange the theme of Military Appreciation as an
        exclusion of military or guests .   Historically, a Governor ' s picnic is hosted in many
        communities throughout the state each summer .   Commissionors & staff of the Governor
        assist in the serving of food and picnics are held in close proximity to the same weekend
        so that it is a statewide event .   The Friday night Mat - Su picnic was held for Mat-Su
        residents and although guests could come from anywhere to enjoy the event, the Anchorage
        picnic was held the very next day (Saturday) to accommodate her residents .     The Greater
        Wasilla Chamber of Commerce has hosted a Military Appreciation Day to honor active service
        men & women ( and their families ) from the Valley for over eight years .   Our Military
        Appreciation Day has never been designed as a statewide event nor a memorial service. It
        has truly been a " thank you " to our Valley residents serving in all branches of military
        service and to provide loved ones the opportunity to receive a blue star flag and
        acknowledgement of support .   Our Chamber decided to combine the Governor ' s picnic and
        Military Appreciation Day into one event to provide our community with one large picnic
        without duplicating the efforts of sponsors , volunteers and attendees.     As you can see,
        the Mat-Su picnic was a labor of love that the Military service men & women , families,
        friends and greater Valley community enjoyed and appreciated.
