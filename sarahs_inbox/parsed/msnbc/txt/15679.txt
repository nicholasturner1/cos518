            Subject: Juneau Delegation Letters on Energy Situation / Confidential




            Deliberative Process Privileged / Confidential



            Governor:




            A draft response to the Juneau Delegation's letters (May 5, May 20) on the energy
            situation in Juneau is attached. If the preference is to not respond, please disregard
            the draft. If the choice is to respond, please send edits to me. As enclosures I have
            the RCA letter orders and the Empire article citing June 8th as the estimated date for
            restoring hydro power.



            Thanks



            Randy
