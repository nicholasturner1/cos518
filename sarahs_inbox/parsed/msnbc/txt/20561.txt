           MESSAGE:

           Hey Sarah! This is April, I met saw you at the Birth Center's grand opening.. .1 had that
           121b baby!  Haha!




          Anyways, I am writing you because I am thinking about reclocating to Wasilla. And who
          better to ask what Wasiila is like than you! :) I've been looking at some places online
          and I am just amazed! I am kinda nervous, I love Juneau but the cost of living here has
          motivated me to move. Its difficult to find a reasonable rental and being on Alaska
          Housing doesn't help.  So, I'm looking towards Wasilla/Palmer. What is it like there? Is
          there any farms? I've always wanted to join a CSA. I know they have the fair in Palmer
          (always wanted to go). How's the crime? How are the elementary schools? Schools is a
          big one for me since I have 3 kids. What's the population in Wasilla? Palmer?




          Ok, I don't wanna go overboard... Love to hear back from ya!
