             Williams from ketchikan. But I guess williams from kenai (who we meet with quite often)
             also griped about lack of access today too.

             is this mayor williams from kenai? If so- he has a meeting with the 3rd floor tomorrow or
             Thursday and anne sutton knows that because I told her ARCH! I haven't read the article
             yet - having trouble accessing it.

              It's a scorcher. Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I won't/didn't spend
             time w/ the Mayors... sheeeesh...



              Sharon ' s comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our office. That's
             our committment.



              I don't want this issue to grow legs, so whatever we have to do to make sure we're not
                                                                   1

             double-booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that they're being ignored - we'll do
             it.



              Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I have not done
             that and it ' d be refreshing if reporters asked for facts to back up complaints like
             that... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug local officials into the schedule as best we
             can - even if that means cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches . Thanks
