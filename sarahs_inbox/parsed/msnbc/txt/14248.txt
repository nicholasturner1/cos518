            Subject:                 G Gordon Liddy


            What's the plan for clarifying the "state is paying him..." rumor that was the subject of
            the editorial and the letters to the editor recently? I don't know who's idea it was to
             (supposedly) pay Liddy to lobby for ANWR, but either Arctic Power needs to answer to the
            rumors, or there at least needs to be clearer messaging that we didn't ask for this, nor
            did we bless the idea of paying him or his expenses anyway as he plans to broadcast from
            AK. Thanks!
