                Fyi - and I've tried twice now to reach Walt, including on the 14th and again today. No answer.
                (Maybe he has caller ID and he is not choosing to hear from me? My question would be short
                and sweet: "Just want to hear it straight from you, why'd you choose to turn down ABC position
                to help serve rural AK?"

                 From Governor Sarah Palin -

                "It was evident that Wait's interest and abilities in the area of public safety could be better
                utilized if he could concentrate his efforts more closely on issues dealing with rampant
                alcohol problems in rural communities where there is great suffering. We recognized that
                there was an ideal opportunity for him to deal with bootlegging and other alcohol problems,
                as executive director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control, and we offered him that opportunity
                and that position. Unfortunately, he chose not to serve the state in this capacity. We are
                moving the Department of Public Safety forward under new leadership."



                 From Colonel Audie Holloway -

                "I am supportive of the new commissioner and his intention to provide leadership and
                guidance to the Department of Public Safety. I have known Commissioner Kopp for several
                years and value the management skills he displayed during his tenure at the Kenai Police
                Department. The Alaska State Troopers will continue to provide the best public service
                possible to the citizens of Alaska - a priority of this administration."
