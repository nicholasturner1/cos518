           accepted her diploma in 1974. She is involved in her Sunday School class and has a large
           circle of friends in our First United Methodist Church of Harlingen ( Texas ). She has
           traveled across the US when we traveled as a family and knows how to read a weather map!
           Jennifer can read, write, tell time and has her own checking account! Her imaginary
           boyfriend is Joey from "Friends"; plus she can read the TV guide and knows "in her head"
