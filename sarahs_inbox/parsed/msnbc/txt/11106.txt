             The PA requested confidentially on the attachments. the pipeline legal team both state
             and consultants are reviewing the request and the correct way forward will be discussed in
             the Monday morning team meeting.  Tom

              Did PA or the two companies request conf attachments?

               Governor,



               The PA's 10 page letter is a public record and was made available yesterday afternoon.
             It was supposed to go up on the AGIA website at some point.



               As you may have noticed , the letter does not identify the specific companies; the
             attachments do.  The attachments have been requested to be treated as confidential.



               Joe

               Is the PA's application made public, along with its supplement? I assumed it was- hope
             it is- the adn made it sound like it wasn't, per Whitaker's comment.



               The public may comment on all five proposals, nothing stops that, but of course the
             application we're considering is TC's. (For that matter they may comment on CP's, also.).



               Thanks
