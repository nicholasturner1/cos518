            As of this morning, there are 119 bills stalled in Senate Finance. Of those 119, 14 bills
            or roughly 10' are bills sponsored by Governor Palin.



           1) Of note, HB 111 Business License Fee Reduction has been stalled in (S) FIN for nearly a
           year--since May of 2007. Commissioner Notti has talked to Sen Stedman personally on this
           bill and Stedman's response was his agenda was full and he wouldn't be hearing the bill.




           When Gov. Palin served as mayor and manager of Alaska's fastest growing city she reduced
           the real property tax six years straight, reduced and eventually eliminated the personal
           property tax, and eliminated the small business inventory tax and the business license
           renewal fee in the City of Wasilla. The governor continues to find ways to reduce and
           eliminate burdensome taxes, and protect Alaskans.



           The full list of other governor's bills in (S) FIN include:



           2) CON Repeal -- Perhaps most important, Gov. Palin's Alaska Health Care Transparency Act
           proposes to provide affordable and quality health- care services for all Alaskans. By
           eliminating CON we allow competition, increase choice, and manage rising costs in health
           care services provided in Alaska. The public is behind the governor in this effort;
           legislators should listen to their constituents on.this matter.




                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0014723

             3) G.O Bond for the crime lab--the current lab is inadequate to efficiently process
             evidence . The new crime lab with serve every PD and AST detachment in the state for
             processing evidence for the next 40 yrs . This request is in line with Gov Palin's
             commitment to providing essential public safety services laid out in Article 1 of the
             State Constitution.



            4) G.O Bonds for transportation projects -- this means Dalton Hwy, Parks Hwy, Seward highway
            will not be improved, among others.



            5) Crime Omnibus bill--  this bill strengthens the Alaska criminal code including
            increasing penalties for domestic violence and prosecuting cases within the State that
            have already been prosecuted federally including prosecution of public officials.

            Divestment from investments in Sudan



            6&7)The House and Senate version of the nonunion public employee salary increase are also
            pending hearing.



            8) Alcohol Penalties and Local Option--this bill increases penalties for liquor license
            holders that sell alcohol to minors .  Also increases penalties for bootleggers who break
            the local option by bringing alcohol into dry communities.



            9) Low- income housing/ homelessness --this bill creates a fund to address the needs of
            Alaska 's homelessness and allows assistance to supply affordable housing for our less
            privledged.   This bill passed out of Sen Fin today!



            10) Natl Guard--allows the governor to delegate to the adjutant general the authority to
            call up the natl guard , and allows DNR to call on the natl guard to fight fires and pay
            them at a range equivalent to emergency firefighters.



            11) Teachers / Hlth Care professionals loan- - this bill has been in S FIN since February.
            This bill would repeal the sunset provision and would make the program permanent within
            AHFC and expands the program to allow more health care professionals to take advantage of
            housing loans -- it's a way to address the severe shortage of health care professionals in
            our state .  Since 2003 , 373 teachers and nurses have mortgaged their homes at no
            additional cost to AHFC or the State.




            12) Transportation Fund




            13)   Operating budget




            14) mental health budget




                                                            2




                                                                                                     PRA GSPO1 0014724

            I'll do it- pls let me know what the status of many of these issues would be. I'm asking
            Frank and ivy to run them down for me also because they' re very passionate about getting
            things done this final week of session . I am asking them to assist , as the call went out
            to commissioners last week to also assist in pressuring lawmakers to do the right thing
            and progress bills and budgets . It's my decision to request their assistance.

           Bill McAllister is working on a "one week to go " story - what is done - what is left - what
           won't get done etc . This seems like a perfect opportunity to talk about Stedman holding
           bills , the predator control bill and lack of movement on the CON . Thoughts?
