             I win a million dollars and marry Brad Pitt :



             I think the numbers are staying the same 27-13 --Peggy won't trick me again . Although I
             hear we might lose Thomas , but I' m not going to count him out just yet b/c his
             constituents , as he said on the floor , don't care one way or the other.



             The sticking point for the Dems was the standard deduc and the sticking point for the Mike
             Kelly type Republicans was .04 prog and 25% base tax rate . The gloom and doom Ralph
             Samuels crew will stick together. Should we go double or nothing?
