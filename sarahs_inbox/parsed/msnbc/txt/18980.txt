              We can spare him. I'm counting on the termination dust on the mountains to
              expedite his return to DC thereafter.

              Larry, could you make arrangements per the Governor's request? Thanks.

                    Thanks so much John. Good information.

                    If you can spare Larry for a couple of hours while he's up here, I'd like for him to sit with
                    us in discussions regarding Alaskan media (and national)... I've asked Sharon and Beth to
                    make Thursday afternoon available for that. And we may even let him return to DC
                    afterwards.

                 Regarding the Congressional delegation and Lisa Murkowski, we followed the roll-out
                 plan. Within minutes of the press release, we contacted the delegation through their
                 transportation staffers with the expectation that they would advise their principals. This
                 is the normal way we have been communicating with the delegation on the bridges.

                 The DC portion of the roll-out plan grew out of discussions with Juneau.

                 Mike/Russ: His presser makes it sound like he and the community were shocked this morning.
                 What was the specific communications with him, Rep Johansan, the community leaders, the
                 delgation, etc. in all these weeks/months - especially the communications with affected
                 legislators this past week as the press release was getting ready to be sent? What was their
                 reaction throughout the week?
