                Governor,
                I just wanted to check in with you to let you know that I think you are doing a terrific job dealing
                with all the various intricacies of your position. Many of my friends who usually use me as a
                sounding board for their complaints have expressed support and respect for you. So keep up
                the good work and know that many folks on the various political spectrums out there are
                supporting you. If you ever need my help in connecting with the Hispanic community, let me
                know.

                Richard
