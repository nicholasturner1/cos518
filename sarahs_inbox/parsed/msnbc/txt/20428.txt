          A foia needs to be requeated, then, on other participants in this? Hollis, Cyr, Walt, etc.
          Why is only one side getting foia'd,?

           Governor, FYI



          PSEA generals council has sent in a letter requesting all emails and electronic
          communications from the Gov's office that contain any references to PSEA, Rob Cox, John
          Cyr, PSEA and bargaining, members, PSEA Ads, PR campaign, PSEA negotiations. So now we
          have yet another request for info that we will have to address. Just so time consuming......
