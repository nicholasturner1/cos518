             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor,

             I just read about your happy event, the birth of your son who was born with down's
             syndrome. Believe me, as years go by, you will realize how lucky you and your. husband are
             to be blessed with his birth.

             I have daughter with down's syndrome and she has been the joy of my life. She was born
             when I was only 21, and she is now a happy, fun-loving 50 year old who just makes everyone
             around her happier.

             Yes, there were difficult times, especially in her early years with the lack of education
             opportunities, but certainly that has changed.

             My daughter has held three jobs in her life time, two of them lasting over 10 years, and
             has a full social life.

             Best Wishes to all your family.

             Dorothy OBrien , Massachusetts resident until last year-now Ohio
