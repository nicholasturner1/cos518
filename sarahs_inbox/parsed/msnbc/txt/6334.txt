        Janice,




        I apologize for not letting you know sooner; since the mid east return changed to 3pm,
        Gary made a reservation for the Governor to return to Anchorage from DC Thursday evening.
        I only know that she will depart at 5:30pm and arrive mid-evening on thurs. I've copied
        Gary for details.

       Under separate email I will include you in the regrets list that I have updated for the
       Governor through July . Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to make this
       process go more smoothly for all involved and I will keep you up to date on scheduling,
       regretting , etc. We have lots of invitations per day coming in. The ones that you see
       right now are the ones that are actually confirmed on the calendar. I do have a report
       that can be run that shows all incoming requests if you would like to see that. it
       usually runs 18-25 pages per month . Thanks , Janice
