              it too!

              Oh yes ..... Kerm mentioned him as well-and he MIGHT be a good candidate for the                 Privileged
             Privile ed board that we have not been able to fill.


              Kerm feels that a Chuck Heath should be your official unpaid advisor for all statewide
              game issues.

              Before I forget - my former employee Don Moore (also former mat su boro manager ) will serve
              for us. He's so smart - he'd be perfect at anything tough.
