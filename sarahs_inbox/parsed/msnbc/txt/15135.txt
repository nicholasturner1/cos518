            Let him know I'll be in chugiak tomorrow morning for a school event - maybe they're
            covering the event anyway.

           Governor-



           Bill McAllister is still interested in talking with you about your approval rating. He was
           hoping he could speak with you tomorrow morning. He also asked if you wouldn't mind
           sharing your thoughts about the special session being held in the Juneau in the midst of
           an energy crisis. Please let me know.
