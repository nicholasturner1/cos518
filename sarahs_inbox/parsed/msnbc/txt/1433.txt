  Subject : Message for Governor from Doyle Holmes
  Mr. Palin -

  Doyle Holmes (from Wasilla) called for the Governor this afternoon and would like for her to
  call him within the next couple days when most convenient. He said that he knows her very
  well (and even has her cell number) but didn't want to interrupt anything by calling her. He
  wouldn't give me any content matter, but stated that it was business related and would take
  less than 5 minutes to discuss. I am sending this to you to make sure that he is someone that
  she knows and would like to call. His contact info is below. Thanks.

  Personal cell: 373-8527
