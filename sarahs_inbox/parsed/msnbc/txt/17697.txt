              Subject: Checking- Exterior Security Lights at 9:30/10:30pm. TONIGHT...

              Tonight at about 9:30 or 10:00pm.- Brian from Morris Engineering and I will stop by to check
              out the reflectivity of the new security lights against the windows. It needs to be dark outside
              and we're trying to get this project wrapped up, so that's why it's so late. Another option would
              be to come over early tomorrow morning before it gets light out.
