             Governor, I just sent an email with an update for this event. Jenni Ragland, PR Director
             for Salvation Army will meet you at the entrance @ 2:00 p.m. They will have a designated
             spot for you blocked off. I just spoke w/Jenni and stated that you had approx. 30 min.
             for this event only.  Janice
