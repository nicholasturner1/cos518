            He did get it. I'll be in a meeting all day today (Pension Obligation Bond Corporation's
            second meeting).  I'd like to update you by phone, if possible - is there a time that's
            better than another?

            Thanks.

            Annette- do you know if Darrell ever received my email? It's strange that it's been almost
            a week and I haven't heard any kind of response or acknowledgement from him that he
            received any email from me. How long does an investigation of this type take?
