             MESSAGE:

            Just read your article about your son Trig. We are so happy for you. My 4th child was
            diagnosed with down syndrome inutero at my 5th month. His presence in our life has raised
            the quality of our lives and character in ways that would have never happened without him.
            My 10 year old recently wrote a short story about her brother to help other children who
            may go through the same thing. She says it's not finished yet but wants to send you a
            copy. Our oldest daughter graduates from med school on the 15 of this month and she feels
            like her life would never be rich without him. I could go on and on but I will stop.
            Thank-you for not aborting this child. And thank-you for sharing your story on national
            news. I feel like God sent me a piece of Himself when He sent us Samuel. With each day I
            hope you and your family can feel what I mean. Sharing your joy and your tears. Sincerely,
            Kathy Harmon PS. Your son was born on my birthday! I was 45 when I gave birth to Samuel.
            :) I am now a much younge

             r 52.
