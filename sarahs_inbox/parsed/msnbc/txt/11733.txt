                 Subject: Kenai River regs

               I came back to Anchorage this afternoon . Jason confirmed we filed the Kenai River regs today (without the
               outright ban of 2 strokes in 2010). After our meeting in Juneau I made personal calls and spoke with Denby, Larry
               Hartig, left a detailed message for Tom I. and spoke with Dick Lefevbre (his deputy commish ), and walked into
               Sen. Wagoner's office where I found Mary Jackson and explained to her since the senator wasn 't around . All are
               fine and thankful for the direction prior to Board of Fish meeting.

               Tom Irwin had indicated he was going to do the press on what was going on.
