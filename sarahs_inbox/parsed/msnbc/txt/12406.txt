              Governor,



               I will get in touch with Mr. Hamel to hear his concerns. I am in Washington, D.C. until
              Thursday morning, so might even be able to meet with him if that is preferable.



               Thanks,

               Larry

               It was a good mtg. He ' s fine about psio funding and is wanting to assist me. He's very
              frustrated tho that he believe BP snookers psio into believing they've got it all under
              control - and sihe still cant believe psio let up on GC 1 fire investigation.



               And Larry - i promised Hamel you ' d call him . He at least wants a quiuck convo on a couple
              of issues that he, again , believes we're getting snookered on. Pls call him. Thanks

               Governor,



              Unfortunately, the Hamel letter is a pdf , and cannot be pasted . Hamel is in DC, as far
             as I know . Jonne will be in the office in 30 mina , and will provide a more detailed
             report to this group then , including a summary of the Hamel letter.



              In short , the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation ( given its
             staffing limitations ), and pushing BP very hard . PSIO has completed a thorough technical
             review that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak,
             and the final section of the report , an addendum addressing materials traceability, will
             be completed in the next day or two .  We'll send it to Mr . Bewak directly and post it on
             the PSIO website.



              As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
             info, you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr. Hamel (I assumed that's why you
             asked where he is)

              Per Chuck Hamel's request , I have attached his latest correspondence to Congressmen
             Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier letter to the House
             Energy Committee.



               I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



               P.S.

              Governor, in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with you during
             your DC trip.
