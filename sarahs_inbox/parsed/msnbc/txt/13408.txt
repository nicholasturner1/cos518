                  Dear Governor Sarah Palin and family,

                 Many blessings to you and your family and the birth of your son Trig Paxson Van Palin. I love
                 the name . I am very sorry to hear that he has Down Syndrome, however, the Lord knew he
                 would have that before he was born . I am sure he is a very special child and through it all will
                 be a blessing to you and your family . Am praying that the Lord give you strength and quick
                 recovery and that He give you and your family a very special love for Trig.

                 Blessings to you as you continue to lead the State of Alaska in the political realm and as a
                 mother and wife to your family.

                 John
