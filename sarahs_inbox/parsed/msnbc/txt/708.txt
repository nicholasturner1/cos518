I'll send the confirmation code shortly. You'll be on flt. 62 ANC-JNU and on the King Air for JNU-
ANC.

If anything happens with the King Air there will be back-up tickets for the morning flt.

You're on the House charge accts.-for A&P, Kenney's Liq. (Rt next to A&P), Foodland Drug &

 Carrs/Safeway (card for Carrs is in that key box, others don't require card). Fred or Tom will pick
you up-unless they hear otherwise..

Enjoy your time in Jnu!
