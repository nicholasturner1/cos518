               Subject : NCTQ Research Competition: Call for Proposals (325)


               The National Council on Teacher Quality is calling for proposals for our research competition,
               Help or Hindrance ? What is the impact of teacher rules, roles, and rights on teacher quality?
               The competition is an opportunity to explore NCTQ's groundbreaking database, TR3, which
               posts the content of collective bargaining agreements , school board policies, and state laws for
               100 schools districts and all 50 states.

               The deadline for proposals is May 30, 2008 --just five weeks away! Apply yourself, or spread
               the word--but act quickly.

               NCTQ is particularly interested in attracting new scholars from all fields to education
               policy research. A jury of top educational scholars will select 12 authors as semi-finalists that
               will receive $5,000 to conduct research and write a formal research paper. In December, eight
               finalists will be selected to present their papers at a national conference to be held in winter'09 in
               Washington, D.C.. At the conference, prizes of $15,000 and $5,000 will be awarded to the top
               two papers.

              For details, please see the attached flyer or visit our website. For questions, contact Trish
              Madden at tmadden@nctq.org, 202-393-0020 x32.
