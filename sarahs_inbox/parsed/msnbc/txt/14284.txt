           Governor Palin,




           Way to go with your 5th. I heard on a radio station how you're pro-life and you've
           "preached" that to others. That's right - they're all blessings and they're here for
           great reasons!!!!!!!!



           God bless you and your family!!!!!!!!!!!



           Chris
