                June 1, 2006. The terms expiring are Art Nelson (consultant and son -in-law of Congressman Young) and Robert
                Heyano from Dillingham.

                Looking at a Law memo from 1991 the removal provisions say "for cause" and "pleasure of the governor." I'm
                having Law look at this right now to determine which it is.

               Thanks,

                Ivy
