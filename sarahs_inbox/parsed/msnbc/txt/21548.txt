              Pls send to kristan and franci- and did joey do an audit? Lyda questioned the "acting
              director of Ag- some guy you put in there from Commerce"? She has incorrect information
              on that, but wouldn't tell me where she got any of her info.

             Lyda just told me she's called for an extensive audit of MatMaid be she said she's
             received a lot of information concerning improprieties and "problems at MatMaid",
             including "conflicts of interest with people serving". I told her "no kidding there's been
             problems, that's why we have a dedicated team of volunteers trying to get information on
             what went wrong and then how to right MatMaid". I also asked her if she's seeking to get
             information on problems we inherited, or did she feel we caused MatMaid's problems? She
             said,  "it's both".



             What's frustrating is Kristan and Kris and others have begged for assistance to get our
             own audit of MatMaid, they've basically had to do it themselves, and now it sounds like a
             legislator who doesn't necessarily want to see us succeed is moving forward on her own
             intense audit. We've had push back on our own request, which is understandably quite
             frustrating for BAC members who've cared sincerely about MatMaid and have wanted and
             needed information on MatMaid operations since Day One. I asked Lyda why don't we work on
             this together, if truly now she wants to help on MatMaid , but her goals are evidently not
             our goals - as we 're not blaming this admin nor this BAC for the problems at MatMaid.



             So, head's up.



             And I still want Kristan's request to be granted re: an audit if that's what Kristan
             needs.
