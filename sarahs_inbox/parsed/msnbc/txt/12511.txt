            MESSAGE.

            Dear Governor Palin:



            Today, I caught the tail-end of Rush Limbaugh' s discussion about you and, judging by what
            I heard, I.beli.eve you should be our Republican Presidential candidate , certainly not
            McCain.



            Born in 1941 and a life-long Conservative Republican, I'm completely disappointed with
            Bush and his father. I voted for senior because I thought he would carry on President
            Reagan's legacy, but he turned on us like a snake. Like-wise, his son's first luncheon
            after his first inaugural was with Mexico's Vincente Fox, who visioned "open borders fro
            Panama to the Yukon."



            Anyway, in checking your stats (NRA life member as I), I would proudly vote for you in a
            heartbeat. At this point in time, I'm dubious about voting in this election. But if I
            don't it would be the first election I ever missed. And if I don't then I can't complain
            and have no say so. I will probably write-in Pat Buchanan' s name ... because he's the one I
            believe should be President.



            Thank you for your time and God bless you and your family.




                                                                 1
