             Hi Sarah,

             I want to personally thank you for meeting with John and me during our recent trip to
             Juneau. Our problem of waterfront access and the construction of a new tank farm seem a
             lot closer now with your help and the help of your assistances . The entire community of
             Gustavus is thankful for your efforts and I believe we will find a route forward through
             this dilemma.



             Thanks so much for your continuing help.



             Sincerely Ken Klawunder - Mayor of Gustavus




                                                                    1
