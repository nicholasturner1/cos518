        Privileged or Per is interested but I haven't offered him anything. That's confidential.

         Governor,



         Tom, Marty and I will coordinate today. I have a thought on staffing, but it depends
         somewhat on what happens structurally.   Could we have today to put our heads together,
         before an interim                     is named? I recognize the need to have the
                               Vaso ego y else be quick and seamless , but it sure would be nice to
         transition from Pnjvj^!to
         make the change permanent.



         Thanks,

         Bruce
