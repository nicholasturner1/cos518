In the meantime I'm saying fish is first, and not listing what's second or third. Thanks

I'm sorry, but this has been a hair pulling experience. This information is not as easy to find as I
thought (or as it should be). Spoke with Emil and he'll see what he can find out. I left msg w/Joe.
Frank spoke to folks in labor: Click & Paula and wasn't able to get definitive info, Paula said that it is
difficult to say as it can be interpreted differently based on source (?).



However, according to ASMI 's website , fishing/seafood is largest . According to ATIA's site , tourism is
third (however I've also seen where it is referenced as 2nd ). I've been trying to find out what would
then be third , oil & gas?



Hopefully Sean has a better idea on resources but I'll keep trying.

Thank you. Maybe Emil or Joey knows off top of head? I'm sure it's correct but want verification

That fisheries are our largest private-sector employer in the state ? (Tourism is second?)
