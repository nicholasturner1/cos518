              I saw that. I guess there is no end to his political grandstanding. Pat did a good job
              responding, don't you think? I know that no one expected you to present the bill.

              Pat,

              Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
              committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work.   I'm here to help you
              guys anyway I can!
