Subject:                Manley


I dont have Gary' s email- pls pass on to him.



PIs note Sat and Sun trip to Manley to meet with Commish Bishop shouldnt be noted officially as
"personal" or vacation as it was my opportunity to speak with DOL - but I dont need to charge the
state per diem because we stayed in click's friend's cabin and we brought our own food.



Official travel, but no per diem/meal allowance for the two days. Thanks
