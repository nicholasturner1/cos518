          Hello Governor Palin...




          I just want to take a moment here to thank you for the excellent job you are doing for the
          citizens of the Great state of Alaska. I have had no regrets for the vote I gave you. I
          have enjoyed pointing out to my visitors this year how we Alaskans have a new governor and
          she is just the new cut of representative we needed for the people here. Please keep up
          the work you are doing and know that you have the support of many as you move us all
          proudly forward.



                                    Thanks again       Kelly Johnson
