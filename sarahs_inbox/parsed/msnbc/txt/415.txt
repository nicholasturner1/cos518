  This is what I sent to Linda to make sure that this would be approved as a purpose. I just don't want any
  surprise bills sent your way... Linda approved this, so it's good to go!

  The purpose would be the Friends of the Alaska Governor's Mansion Foundation. To learn more about
  the Foundation, plan a luncheon, come up with a list of needed repairs for the House, and plan a
  Fundraiser. Some things that need to be addressed are: choose a date for a Foundation luncheon
  (2weeks), appoint a new member to the board on behalf of the Governor, plan a fundraiser, discuss
  marketing of products (ornaments, dvds...) and the new House pins/zipper pulls, discuss if a new
  ornament will be produced for this year, the status of the book (Carol). etc...

  Thanks a bunch-!
  Erika
