              A request was also just received from Jenni Ragland, The Salvation Army - ANC. On
              Thursday , 12.20 . 07 @ 2 : 00 p.m . Wal-Mart officials will be presenting $25,000 (500 gift
              cards ) to the Salvation Army at their Dimond/Old Seward store. ANC is one of eight
              communities selected from across the country. They would love the Governor to participate
              in helping families receive these and help them shop.




              Thank you , Janice
