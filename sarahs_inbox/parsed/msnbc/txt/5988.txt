                Subject: Ft. Rich Memorial Svs today at 11:00am
               We were notified late yesterday that there would be a memorial service for 11 Ft. Rich paratroopers lost in
               Iraq in May. The service was today at 11:00am. I received the email from DMVA at 5:00pm last night, but
               didn't open it until this morning when getting caught up on emails. It is my understanding that Gen.
               Campbell is attending, and we were being notified. I wanted you to have this information in case you hear
               about it today! Kari.
