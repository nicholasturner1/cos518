         Subject:                 Approp


         Forgot to ask yesterday - is the approp bill REQUIRED at this time, early in sp session?
         Recognizing we are estimating costs and what it is the gasline will need (trained
         workforce, infrastructure, etc) are we premature on any line items in the bill but the
         actual AGIA matching certification funds?
