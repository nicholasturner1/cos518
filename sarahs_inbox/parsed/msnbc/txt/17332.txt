         Dear Governor ' s Office,

         I am currently in Istanbul, Turkey teaching English but we (my husband Ken DeRoux

         and I) will return to Juneau July 1st to sell our house. Our house is located about a 3

         min. walk from the Governor's Mansion at 836 Calhoun Avenue. I wanted your office

         to know we plan to sell our house this summer. I am not advertising it; only via word

         of mouth.

         If you know anyone in your office that is interested, please do not hesitate to email

        me.



        My friends (many Democrats!) are praising your work! it is wonderful to have you, a

        woman, in such a prestigious office!!! I will share information about you with my

        Upper Level Business Students here.



        Thank you,

        Sybil Davis
