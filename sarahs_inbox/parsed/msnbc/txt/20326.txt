         MESSAGE:

         I have to be honest with you Governor Palin I havent agreed with you on several things
         especially when it comes to the wildlife in Alaska and the manner in which they are hunted
         but I have to say I applaud you for the move you have taken to help the people of Alaska
         in times of hardship. As a older women who is getting ready to move to the interior to be
         able to live off the land as much as possible thank you. I pray for you and your family
         and that new beautiful baby boy.
