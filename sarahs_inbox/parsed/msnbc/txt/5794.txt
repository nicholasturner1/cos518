            FYI again. Mary Pemberton with the AP called to tell me that it's a downloadable Bible insert
            on the Alaska Family Council website. It prompted the note below.

            Jim,

            Again, on behalf of Governor Sarah Palin, I respectfully ask that you remove the Governor's
            official portrait and title from your website. As has already been conveyed, the Governor
            does not feel that it is appropriate to advise Alaskans on how to vote on the issue. The fact
            that you still have the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor on a downloadable document
            is entirely inappropriate.

            Thank you for your immediate attention.

            Meghan
