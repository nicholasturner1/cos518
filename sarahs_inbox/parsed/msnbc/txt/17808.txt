            I am not sure if it was passed along to you but Paulette Simpson is concerned that you will be bombarded with
            individuals opposed to the Juneau Road while you are in Skagway. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

            kari - fyi interview for record/schedule. also - security just called me on their way to pick me up for
            flight to skagway - now the problem is the King Air has a flat tire so can't fly afterall. My family is all
            on the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the niceities without me this evening in Skagway and I'll still try
            to get there somehow tomorrow. what a continued zoo this is, trying to get from point A to point B -
            and i don't know why the flat tire wasn't discovered until a just now.

            erika and ivy - I may be here afterall tonight.

              Ch. 2, Joy Mapaye, was wondering if you could call her for a quick interview. End of the
              session is here, how are things and with the arrests - is that too big of a distraction as the session
              ends? Her number is 762-9260. Please let me know if possible - I could also look for Irwin.
              Interview should either happen before 4:30 or after 6:00.

              Thanks.
