          Dear Mr. and Ms. Streifel:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

         Governor Palin,

              Thank you for being the conservative governor we elected. Trimming the budget the way
         you did was the right thing to do. It reaffirms Dolly and my conviction that you will be
         the best governor we've had. It makes us happy we worked so hard to help get you elected.
         May God Bless You.


                                                                1
