            I'll make the time - everyone just needs to let me know what I need to know because I'm
            asked everyday what's going on. Thanks

            As your time allows I would appreciate you hearing from Marty so you can get her overview
            also.  Tom

             I'm asking Janice to put on sched a good chunk on time to get a preliminary overview of
            what we're looking at. Joe and I talked about that last night and I asked him for that
            review . Thanks

             Yes, it is appropriate and wanted that you participate as much as your time allows.    You
            and the gasline team need to be on the same page just like with the AGIA bill and with
            ACES .  If you let us know timing we can facilitate updates /participation / communications
            with you.



              AGIA is much different than the decision to be made for the Point Thomson remand
            hearing.   God bless.  Tom

               I'm hearing more scuttlebutt from TC's visit to lobby for Congressional assistance back
             in DC - that they were very careful not to sound like $$$ was an AGIA prerequisite, but it
             seemed very clear that more assistance was in their game plan.



              Is it appropriate to share concerns like this with you as the review is ongoing? is it
            approriate to share with Marty, Joe, Pat... anyonen during the fact-finding , objective
            review period?
