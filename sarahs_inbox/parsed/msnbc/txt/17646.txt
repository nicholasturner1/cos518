            Cathy may have a good idea appointing an economist and/or a consumer.

           Ivy
           I have a suggestion for the Health Strategies Council.
           It would be so good if some of the Health Council members were consumers and economists. This
           would provide the objective perspective of financial people and the real life experiences of consumers
           trying to access healthcare. So, with that in mind:
           Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           Hope that helps.
           Cathy
