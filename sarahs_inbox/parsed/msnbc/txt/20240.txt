              Actually a fun interview. It let me talk about something very important in addition to the gasline.

              First question centered on what do I think of the Governor bringing the baby to meetings. I told him it was
              great. Talked about three things. We have a great Governor who continues to work exceptionally hard for
              Alaskans and remains involved. It reminds me why we are working so hard, its for our kids and grand kids
              future, and is an example for all that women can excel at the top positions in any business.

              He asked if the baby caused any interruptions like making noise at funny or tense times, or what about
              diaper changes? I couldn't think about any examples, except its special to get to hold Trig at a break or
              end of the meeting.

              Is Trig at every meeting? No, sometimes there, many times not The Governor has a great husband,
              family and support family. Real positive example.

              Asked about Piper. Told him I was impressed how she behaved and acted at events. Shared how she let
              guests know lunch was ready. Also she will come in and hug mom, mom gives a hug back and Piper
              goes on her way. Its positive.

              What do I think about working for the Governor now. Its easy because I can talk about integrity, doing
              what is right, openness.

              He asked how the gasline is going. Told him it passed both the House and Senate. Alaska is taking a
              major step forward in getting clean energy to Alaskans and the lower 48. He said he just hooked natural
              gas up to his pool heater.

              He ended with we are lucky . I disagreed told him we are blessed . He said that is a better word. Tom
