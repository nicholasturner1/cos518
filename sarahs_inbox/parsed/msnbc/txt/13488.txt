             Yikes- I won't even read them. Since Joe and Tibbles wrote the letter, would u mind asking
             them if they had considered the ramifications with our supporters on the abortion
             decision? Put a little bit of this back on them- ask them what they did to anticipate this
             and counter it pro-actively?!

             Thank you, team, for everything you did to help with getting our letter

             and message out to the press yesterday. The Wesley story was very good,

             as was the Bill McAllister story. Great job. It was a team effort.



             Now. About the blogs. As you know, our boss is getting pounded. Let's

             take action. TODAY.



             Frank and Ivy, if you could get the word out to your contacts --

             grassroots supporters who love our boss -- we need to get them out there

             FLOODING that Anchorage Daily News Alaska Politics blog. I mean

             FLOODING.




             Some ideas of what people can say:

                                                                      1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01 _0015889

             * Words of support

             * Reminding readers of that blog that the people of Alaska

             overwhelmingly demonstrated their confidence in our boss by bringing her

             into office and that she continues to have their support          -- with that 85

             percent approval rating      ( if that's the right number).

             * Quoting Newt Gingrich that Governor Palin is one of the most

             aggressive reformers in the country ( check exact quote)



             Ivy and Frank, can you guys make some calls and make that happen today?

             If you don't have time, please e - mail me some names and numbers and I'll

             call them myself.



             Thanks!
