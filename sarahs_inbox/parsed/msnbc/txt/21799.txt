              Hi!  Tom is running over to the house for me to grab sandwich - making stuff so I can feed
             the few staffers who are here ( ACES team, basically) on Vet's Day today.



              I now realize the meat and bread may be for Rep women ' s group ? If I took their food for
             our lunch , I'll replace it!
