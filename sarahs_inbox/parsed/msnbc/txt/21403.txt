             Governor and Mike,



             I talked with Mike yesterday requesting permission to miss the cabinet meeting tomorrow.
             I really hated to ask but Bill Fickus's memorial is tomorrow in Fairbanks. He and his
             wife Lil lived at Crevis Creek in the Brooks Range for years. Lil is from Ft Yukon. They
             and their children have treated Sharon and I like family .  We were always welcome to stop
             there while flying in the Brooks or rafting the John River. I rechecked the times and the
             only way I can attend is if I travel on the 11:00 am flight to Fairbanks.   Because the
             cabinet meeting is so important, Marty would be willing to fill in for me .  If any times
             change I would also call in.



             For my schedule, I feel I need to attend the breakfast for the CEO of Anglo, Tuesday
             morning, before I go to Fairbanks. I would be back to Anchorage on the 6:00 am flight
             Wednesday morning.



             Thanks for your consideration     Tom
