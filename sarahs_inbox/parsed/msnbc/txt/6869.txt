         No, it doesn't sound like me - pls Let em know I didn't write it - no one showed it to me
         - Kari reports it was the signature machine signing. But its water under the bridge now.

         Relevant portions:



        "It is not the intent of this proclamation to promote a particular religion, but rather to
        encourage thoughtful reflection on the condition of our state and country and to honor our
        freedom of religious expression whether that is prayer, alms giving, fasting, peace
        activism, meditation, promotion of social justice or another form of contemplative action.




        ...I urge you to join fellow Americans across racial, political, and religious boundaries
        to observe the National Day of Prayer within your respective communities and faith
        traditions.




        "May we be thankful for our blessings, reflect on the many needs of our state and nation,
        treat our neighbors with dignity and respect, and seek moral and spiritual renewal through
        the religious or spiritual expression which most closely aligns with who we are as
        individuals.




        Now, therefore... proclaim ...as National Day of Prayer in Alaska and encourage Alaskans to
        keep the health, well-being, prosperity, and peace of our state, nation and world in mind
                                                                 1

         I don ' t know , it was delivered to my office - so I don't know who signed off on it. It
         was in final form when I received it, so I thought that you had seen it .    These are
         usually done by Michelle Fabrello , but it ' s been my experience that someone in the
         Governor ' s office signs off on it .  I don't know anymore than that.

         Subject : National Day of Prayer proclamation




         Governor:



         We don ' t know each other really well , and I'm going out on a limb here , but the
        proclamation I read today for National Day of Prayer did not sound like you .     It was, and
        I apologize for my language here , mamby-pamby pabulum.    I did not have an opportunity to
        read it before around 10 a.m. this morning.




        After the Governor ' s Prayer Breakfast , and your statements there ( which I again heard much
        positive feedback on today from the pastors who were at the Day of Prayer gathering), the
        proclamation was almost embarrassing .    I am always honored to offer remarks on your behalf
        and I don ' t mean to sound ungrateful for the opportunity - but, you asked us to tell it to
        you straight and so , I'm believing that you meant that.




        I held onto this email for about 30 minutes before sending it.   In that time, I was told
        the Valley pastors who gathered for National Day of Prayer did not read the proclamation
        because of the wording . I guess that ' s my confirmation that I should hit the send
        button.

         Thanks for all that you do and I know you're working hard on other issues, but I have been
         a witness to what happens when a Governor is insulated from any criticism. I believe you
         can be an incredibly successful Governor.
