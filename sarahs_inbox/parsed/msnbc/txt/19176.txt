         Mike - the "To Do " list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time ( it's overdue ) to move on.



         What process are you , as COS , using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
         hands ( I spoke with Emil about           yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
         Leo about Prlvlle ed o .. I'll cc them in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
         the notifications ), should I contact them myself , or have you already contacted them?



         I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
         ended . If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
         overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better [Privileged or Personal M^

         Thanks
