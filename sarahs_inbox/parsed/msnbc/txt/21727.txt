               Subject:                "pressure"


               Don't know how these rumors of me "pressuring" lawmakers- espescially Rural leggies-
               started, and don't know why they're continuing, but I've met with them many times and
               communicated with lawmakers on the phone at your request and upon your advice. Now, if
               it's doing more harm than good to talk to any lawmaker (and I've never threatened, bribed
               or anything else), please don't keep setting up these opportunities to work with them.



               I think it's fishy that Harris came to me with the rumors of my "threats" to lawmakers if
               they don' t go along with ACES, which is bull... and then it' s his suspicious aide we
               believe is blogging the same bogus information.



               Please do what you can do about the situation because perhaps we're better off not giving
               our critics more opportunity to lie about the situation, meaning no more meetings between
               me and lawmakers. ?
