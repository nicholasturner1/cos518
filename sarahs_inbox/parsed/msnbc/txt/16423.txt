           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,




           Before this very day 6/27/08, I have never heard any mention of your name until on a
           political blog.  Then just a few minutes ago I heard you talking on the phone to a Fox
           News host.  To be very honest, I am very pleased with I hear and feel about you. I would
           like to know a little more about you ie: Your stance on abortion, gay rights and etc. If
           you are the type of person I think you are, John McCain would be doing himself and this
           great country a huge favor if you were on the Republican ticket. Would you consider the
           VP spot with McCain?



           McCain is just a little to liberal to suit me. But he would be great in the security of
           this nation.  We need some balance on the ticket.



           God Bless,    Rev. Jim Hyde,

          Thanks to the vision of our governor , the city of Palmer and the greater Palmer area will
          realize improvements to the east end of the Palmer-Wasilla Highway, water main
          replacements and paving projects on Blueberry Street, Lucas area streets and Felton
          Street. We have also been afforded grants for upgrading our own wastewater facility as
          well as funds to design a consolidated facility involving Palmer, Wasilla and the Mat-Su
          Borough . In addition , we will be adding to our street light project in the downtown area
          and upgrading sidewalks to Americans with Disabilities Act compliance.
