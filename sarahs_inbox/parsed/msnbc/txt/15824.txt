           Can't open but thank u for writing this- Tom can not subject himself to their line of
           questioning, as legislators no doubt know.

           Dear Governor Palin and Mr. Nizich,

                  Attached are letters just sent to Speaker Harris and Sen. Green

           advising them that DOL advises Comm. Irwin not to subject himself to

           questioning by them about his Pt. Thompson decision. Talis
