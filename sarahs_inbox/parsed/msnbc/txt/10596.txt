                  Subject: Therriault

                 Governor,

                Sen. Therriault called to let me know that his group has sent a letter to John Cowdery asking him to step down
                prior to session. He did copy Lyda Green and Gary Stevens . He actually spoke to Gary about it but they have
                not released it publicly and he does not intend to do so at this time. His goal is to give the majority some time to
                deal with it first (holiday spirit). There are a lot of rumors about Cowdery not coming to session or working from
                home and those rumors in conjunction to statements made by Allen and Smith during the corruption trials led
                Therriault's group to send the letter. Gene wanted us to be aware of what they are doing but is hoping we will
                keep it quiet until his group decides to say something publicly.
