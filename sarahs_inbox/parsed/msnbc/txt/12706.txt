            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations Sarah and Toddll Sarah, you are truly an inspiration to all women!
            Didn't you have Piper while you were Mayor of Wasilla?



            You're doing a great job. When I saw you a couple of months ago downtown, you didn't look
            pregnant.  I would have never known!



            Keep up the good work!
