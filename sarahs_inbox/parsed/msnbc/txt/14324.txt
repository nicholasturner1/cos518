          Subject:                 Fairbanks Energy Costs


          I am sitting in the FAI airport waiting to see if I'll be able to get a flight back home
          tonight. Thought I'd pass along some feedback from Fairbanks residents that will probably
          serve to confirm what you already know.



           1. Very hot environment on high energy costs.

           3. Economy clearly suffering due to high energy costs.
