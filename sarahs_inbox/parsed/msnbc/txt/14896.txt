            Hello, I just read an article in the Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel about the birth of your
            son. I have a 5 year old son with Down syndrome. Most moms I read about dedicate
            themselves to their child and become a stay at home mom. I enjoyed reading about a mom who
            continued her career. I think it is great that you treat this child's birth the same as
            your others. Thank you for being such a strong role model.
