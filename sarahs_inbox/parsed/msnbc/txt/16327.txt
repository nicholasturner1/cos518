            Very cool. I will try. I still need to get out of that long golf gane with the Chinese
            that day.

            Good morning -



            Rep Craig Johnson just called to invite you to a going-away party for John Tracy this
            Sunday, he'll call back with exact time.



            Many many of the past employees will be attending so he wanted to be sure you were
            included . It'll be held at Rep Johnson's home - since his wife has worked for Channel 2
            News for 25 years.



            Address:    12200 Timberland Drive (south Anchorage).



            Kelly




                                                                  1
