             Governor - I just received a phone call from Jim Bowles office. Mr. Bowles is requesting
             to speak with you via phone before 9:20 a.m. today, Wed., 04.30.08. They have two
             announcements that they will be making at 10:00 a.m. and wanted to make sure you knew
             before the public announcement.  Mr. Bowles can be reached via his cell jilpa     or we can
             set up a call for afternoon (but announcement will have been made). Janice
