              Subject: CONFIDENTIAL FAIRBANKS ROTARY SPEECH ON THURSDAY
              and (confidentially at this point, between you, Sharon, Ivy and me) i'll announce a fairbanks
              resident as UA regent at that speech. i have Ivy working on candidate whom i have in mind. just
              dont want folks to know be dont want others to attempt to talk. me in or out of regent appts. and
              am annoyed by legislators' demands on this one.

             we also have to turn this one into a win as it pertains to admin's overall goals and agia.

             thanks!

             also - love your idea on Irwin's participation in speech.

               I'd like to propose that the Governor's address to the Fairbanks Rotary on Thursday
               be more of a joint address with the Governor and Commissioner Irwin. What I am
               thinking is almost a dry-run for Barrow - the Governor will address the audience for
               the first ten minutes regarding the importance of AGIA and then Commissioner Irwin
               would add to that. What do you think? Are you comfortable with that?

               Thanks,
               Meg
