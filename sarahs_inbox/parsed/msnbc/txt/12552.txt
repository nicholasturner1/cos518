            Subject: Water Mining Initiative




            We are getting asked for quotes on the court decision on the water/mining decision in
            Fairbanks and this is what we've been saying (since this win came in the council of Alaska.
            Producers case we're focusing on the procedural aspect rather than doing the big victory
            lap) . :



            Parnell said, "It's important to get certainty and finality on these

            significant water and mining issues. Though the

            decision will likely be appealed, it brings us one step closer to an

            Alaska Supreme Court decision on whether the initiative is the proper

            route for deciding these issues or whether that is the Legislature's

            exclusive domain."
