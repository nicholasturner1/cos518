             MESSAGE:

             Dear Gov. Palin:



             I just watched the Glenn Beck show on the television and was overcome with joy when he
             quoted you on your "perspective" on the birth of your fifth child. Sarah, congratulations
             to you and your family for having such a special outlook for the blessings bestowed upon
             you all.  God is good! I hope and pray that your message is heard across the planet. we
             as Americans can learn so much from those with special needs. I personally want to thank
             you for your feelings and your faith which will be shared with all whom have the good
             fortune to hear your message . God bless you and your family!



             Another concerned American,



             William R. Reynolds III
