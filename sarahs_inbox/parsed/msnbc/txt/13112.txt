           Thanks! And I sure wish Sheila would put her talents to better use than gossip.



           Statement from DY to Sandy is true , Sean told me. Ramras - true . AGIA the spaz- true. And
           it seemed like Fagan had a crush on Reagan when she first got here based on his gushing
           early on.



           Btw- thanks for doing those KTUU sound bites last night- you looked/sounded great.

           Subject: likely ear items




           In Sunday' s Ear - Sheila will likely have items on:



           What Don Young said to Sandy Parnell at Republican Convention

           Jay Ramras' potty mouth

           Dan Fagan's and/or Robert Forgit's romance with Reagan Scott (Channel 11) - She actually
           dated Robert not Dan. Sheila was hoping she would marry Dan and her name would be Reagan
           Fagan - whatever.

          AGIA the dog living in Talkeetna - She was going to make some "rude" reference about AGIA
          going away - I set the record straight (about AGIA being a spaz ) and also let her know
          about the new puppy!
