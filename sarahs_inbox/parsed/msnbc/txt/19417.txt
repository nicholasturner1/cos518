           Posted on ADN website is his "fired" statement. Wish he had chosen to take the offer to
           serve the state in a better capacity for him- the bootlegging concentration through ABC
           position. Should we include that in presser now? I don't like his comment that "her new
           direction will be communicated in time". It's really not the best thing to have his
           communication to the public sound like it sounded in his departure memo.
