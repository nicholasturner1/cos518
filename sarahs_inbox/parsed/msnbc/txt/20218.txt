           Am here at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Mega Meeting.



            Senator Stevens made a surprise visit.



            Julie Kitka made a request at this afternoon's energy roundtable.



            Would like you to add energy relief for health care systems and schools to the special
           session -- or call a special session this fall.



            Tara Jollie and I are here.



            Anything you want us to say?



            Thanks.
