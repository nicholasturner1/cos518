              MESSAGE:

              Gov. Palin:

               I was browsing through the Alaska state law section of the Human Rights Campaign home
             page, and I was not able to find anything that stated how the Alaska government identified
             the gender of a transgender individual. I would appreciate it if you would either send me
             the information or the resources so that I may find this information myself. I was also
             curious how a transgender person fit into the ban on same-sex marriages. Again, a resource
                                                               1
