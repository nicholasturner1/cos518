            Sarah:  Just wanted to say that I think this is a bunch of garbage with this Wooten
            matter.  Anybody that knows your family (Heath) and has been your supporter can see
            through this.  Obviously, Andrew Halcro has a grudge to have posted such non-sense on his
            website. Keep the faith. Please tell Molly I said hello. Nickie Reaves-Nelson
