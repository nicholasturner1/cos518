            Senator French and Senator Weilichowski have said they may call for an audit by LB&A of
            Corrections.  Senator French may also be holding a Judiciary Committee hearing towards the
            end of the month. Commissioner Schmidt has already stated in response that whatever the
            forum, he welcomes the opportunity to talk about the reforms and work he and his team are
            doing with the Department, and that if reasonable ways to improve are suggested or found
            as part of this process, he is open to considering those. He also continues to wait for
            the union to come to the table and discuss the issues.
