            I returned Suzanne ' s (Rep Meyer's cos ) phone call yesterday re: the op-ed. Below is her
            response.



           His office is saying they haven't heard from the 3rd floor re: a hearing request for this
           bill.  I work on hearing requests all the time. I'm more than happy to draft the language
           and send to Russ to expedite the process-it will take 10 minutes tops, I know the bill
           backwards and forwards.  I could even send it to Kris to send to Russ as to not step on
           toes.

            and looked at hearing requests that I have received, and we haven't even received a
