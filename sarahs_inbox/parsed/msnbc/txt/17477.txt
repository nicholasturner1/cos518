           The Director of the Saturday Tea the Governor and Bristol are attending notified us that the theme of the Tea is:
           "Girls Can Do Anything." There will be a female police officer that speaks first (because she has to leave); then
           Lesil McGuire , then lunch , then the Governor and Bristol . A formal agenda is coming . They were hoping the
           Governor would speak to what it was like growing up in Alaska , and becoming the first female Governor, and
           "what did you do to get here?* The ages of girls attending are 5-14 . The girls have been asked to dress in "their
           Sunday best." They are expecting 150-200 girls. The event runs from 1 :00 to 3:00pm.
