             Dear Commissioner Lloyd,

            Attached, please find a letter which outlines the Douglas Indian Association's
            concerns regarding Redfern Company's proposed barge access alternative on the
            Taku River. The Taku River is the heart of our homeland and we have many
            concerns regarding the impacts of this proposal on fish and wildlife. The Douglas
            Indian Association is a federally recognized tribe and we have a government-to-
            government relationship with the United States and its agencies . We hope you will
            take the time to read our letter and that you will ensure that DNB's permitting
            process respects our concerns and our information requests. Thank you for your
            time in advance.

            Scott J. Sloane , Environmental Planner
            Douglas Indian Association
