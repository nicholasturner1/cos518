               Nah- too quick of a visit. I had a long time to speak to stevens about it that day though.
               The Pres and I spoke about military, incl Track's deployment and how iraq is a different place than it
               was a year ago. He also spoke about (and we joked about) VP buzz.

               Governor, I talked to John Katz this morning and he asked if you ever had the opportunity to mention anything to
               the President about supporting seismic work in ANWR?

               For sched pls note Todd and Click and Balash may plan to meet on AGIA training $ before we all head to Nenana.
               Let Melissa know they may use the Fairbanks Office. Britta can also meet Melissa at this time and go to the
               Fairbanks Office to get aquainted there before the Nenana trip, then after I need to stop at the Tanana Fair to visit
               some of those booths I've been invited to.
