         I found a flight at 3:50 pm on American Airlines that would get you in to Anchorage at
         11:12 p.m.  We'll look into this/availability. Bob is calling the NY troopers now.

         Original flt was just pushed back again so there's no way to make any                  connection. We have
         to take a different airline and may get in at 2AM. My main concern is                  missing any of the
         mtgs we've scheduled for tomorrow, inlc the Fairbanks town hall mtg.                   I may have to stay in
         Anchorage tonight if we dont lv the airport agter getting our luggage                  around 2:30 or 3AM.

         I'll let Linda know. I believe Bob is talking with the troopers in NY on new flight
         arrangements /solutions. Please let me know if I can do anything.

         They may need a new purchase of tickets be these fits are all messed up with weather. And
         i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pls let
         linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
         fairbanks.

         Your connection will be 30 minutes - enough time to make flight. If you change, not arrive
         til 2 am
