              Hi Sarah,  Just thought I'd share a little pearl that will probably make you smile. Lexie
              just won an "Al Neuharth Free Spirit Award/Scholarship" in journalism (He is the founder
              of USA Today). Anyway, they choose 2 students from each state and bring them all to
              Washington, DC to compete for a 50K scholarship in March.      Since you were at Colony High
              to induct Lexie into Quill&Scroll, I thought you would appreciate the scope of this award.
              By the way, her focus is currently on Pre-Med ... go figure !!   Take Care, keep up the good
              work.  Kathy Krell
