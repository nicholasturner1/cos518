             Subject:                  Kenai Fish


             Talis may be contacting you to ask if you have a file on Kenai Comm fishermen request
             (last year ) to investigate Kenai Sport ' s receipt of a Ted Stevens ' $ 4 million earmark - it
             was the subject of FBI probe / controversy . I remember the request for investigation coming
             from Comm fishermen group, and Dept of Law did investigate with the help of F and G, they
             concluded they believed the Bob Penney / Eldon Mulder sport fish group did nothing wrong in
             receiving the earmark ( and this was all before our time )... I don't think we've heard
             anything since.



             However , more info is now being requested . I asked Talis to ask you and Janice if we have
             anything else on it . Thanks
