            MESSAGE:

            I wish you a very happy upcoming birthday.

            I also feel I'm speaking for many fellow Republicans when I say

            you should give serious consideration for running for President in the 2012 elections.

            You have many fine personal and professional accomplishments ,              and I feel you would be an
            excellent choice.

            Keep up the fine work , and have a very happy birthday, Governor!
