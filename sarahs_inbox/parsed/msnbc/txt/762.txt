      Hello Governor and Todd,

      Just a quick plumbing update:

      Everything works in the House except for the two items in Piper's bathroom and the laundry sink in the
      basement. There's more information at the bottom of this email.

      I have been very impressed with both of the contractors on this project- they're good, hardworkers!!

      Look forward to seeing everyone!!
      Erika
