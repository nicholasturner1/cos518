       Republican Murkowski funneled money to road for her home

       August 8, 2007

       Anchorage, Alaska - Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has secured $6 million in
       federal funds to build a road leading straight to a plot of land she bought - but was
                                                                1

        forced to sell - after being exposed July 16th by the TPMmuckraker website.

        An August 7th article by Laura McGann and Paul Kiel at TPM , also says that her father,
        Alaska ex - governor Frank Murkowski , diverted $ 325,000 of state money while he was in
        office to her road.

        From TPM - Sen . Ted Stevens ( R-AK) and Rep . Don Young ( R-AK) rounded up an extra $2
        million for the three - mile road project, which is just under half mile from Murkowski's
        plot, which she sold back to Penney in the wake of the controversy.

        And even that ' s not all . To cover matching costs required by some of the federal money,
        Murkowski ' s father, then - Gov. Frank Murkowksi ponied up another $ 325,000 in state funds.
        It's unclear whether the project, construction for which is set to begin next year, will
        boost the value of the land.
