            Rosanne : Pls do a quick presser clarifying that not only did state regulators not request
            these funds , but despite the recepient of the funds being the Gov's Office we did NOT
            request them.

            Pls make sure it ' s publicized that the Gov ' s Office did NOT request the $ for pebble
            "influence " initiative ( see today ' s ADN ). In fact , Tom and I have repeatedly said publicly
            we will NOT in any way attempt to sway any ballot initiative and certainly have no
            intention on spending public dollars to influence this issue that at some point will be in
            front of voters.
