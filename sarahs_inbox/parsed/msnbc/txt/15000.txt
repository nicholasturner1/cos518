            MESSAGE:

            I appreciate your desire to hold government spending in check. However, I believe that
            you are micro-managing the capital budget process with the Alaska Legislature. You were
            asked for a budget figure but did not give the Legislature one. Let these elected
            officials do their job -- rather than making their decisons for them.



            Thank you for your consideration.
