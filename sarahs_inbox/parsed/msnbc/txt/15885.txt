           Good Morning,



           RE: Fuel subsidy




           I hope Governor Palin doesn't give credence to those who would try to effect social
           engineering by keeping fuel prices high.



           I think it is only reasonable that residents of an energy rich State like ours should
           recieve some sort of direct benifit from those resources.



           A subsidy at the supplier level seems a logical course.




                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01 _0018991

           PS--Kudos for supporting Commissioner Joe Schmidt. Its about time somebody stood up to a
           public employee union.




           Thank You and keep up the good work.
