MESSAGE:

Governor Palin, we met you and your husband at the Womens Conference Banquet a couple of
nights ago here in Wasilla. I asked if an email would get to you if I sent one to you, you replied that I
was to send it to your husband Todd who would make certain you received it.

I think my age is beginning to show on me because I walked out of there withut his email address.
Please send it to me at:
