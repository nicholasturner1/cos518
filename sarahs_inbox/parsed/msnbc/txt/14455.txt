          Hopefully, all of this has now quieted = down .  However , I thought that you might want to
          see the attached = email from Adrian Herrera of Arctic Power in response to my inquiry
          last = week about what they were doing to clarify the Gorden Liddy situation.&nbsp= ; I
          circulated this on a limited basis to administration folks.



          If you think more needs to be done by Arctic = Power , please let me know , and I will
          contact them today.
