                  Subject: kaltag appeal

                Dear Governor Palin,
                    If possible I would like to meet with you for 15 - 20 minutes on Monday to review the Kaltag case. It is a
                Native " inherent authority" appeal that will be noticed in Native circles . I need to approve or deny an appeal and I
                want you to understand our plan and have an opportunity to approve or stop it as you will be likely asked about it
                    Just let me know if I can come over anytime Monday. Talis
