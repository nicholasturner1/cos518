          Just got it all taken care of. Michael enjoyed and appreciated the information I had for
          him, particularly considering his disappointment re "no LNG" (I re-filled his sails
          there).  He was thankful and indicated that before going live on air, he wanted time to
          study the Exec Summ, and then speak with Tom on Tuesday. This worked out perfectly,
         .because now (on air), instead of sounding disappointed, he is saying nice things about the
          Gov/Commissioners' open-mindedness to LNG, and heavily promoting the Irwin appearance on
          Tuesday.  We're good.

         I really don't want him to feel snubbed, sometimes he sounds put off.

         FYI: Just to be sure Michael does not feel snubbed, I will call in unless Tom specifically
         tells me not to (we are Blackberrying now). Don't want to rob Michael of the Irwin fire
         on Tues , but that's five days from now, and if Michael wants to chat while the news is
         hot, I ' m at the state ' s service.

          Yikes! - my oversight.



          I can't get in contact with Kurt or Bruce, my first two go-tos. If Kurt or Bruce get
          this, one of you call the Michael Dukes show, at 458-8255. It goes form 4-6 p.m, so call
          fast!
