            Not necessarily. There are many things that seem to be popping up that I have had no clue
            about in this budget process, despite the endless meetings. Between the status of our
            legislative pieces in front of lawmakers and these budget adds, there's plenty to surprise
            me every day lately.

            I am sure we would have heard about the funding if it was going to be put in, we have
            heard from them on about everything else having to do with Polar Bears and ESA in general.

            I read in this morning ' s Fairbanks News - Miner that the Legislature wants to appropriate $2
            million to itself for a national conference and public relations campaign to educate
            Americans about the impacts of a polar bear listing under the Endangered Species Act.
