              Subject: Cost Savings
              Are all state employees going to get the same offer to drive home State vehicles like DOT
              Maintenance is doing as a cost saving to the employee.

              I see these (crew cabs, vans, 4x4's heavy duty trucks) everyday and on weekends to and from
              work, parked in driveways at night and over the weekends, WalMat, recreational areas like last
              week while dip netting at Chitina.. children passengers in the morning and evenings, pulling
              campers.....

              I get called in at odd hours all the time to work, does this justify getting a State vehicle for
              myself too....take care of this, or I will find someone that will....thankyou Ben
