           Todd- it occurred to me that the press has not understood Security Detail telling you to
           share First Family safety concerns with DPS boss... but then also Walt's follow-up
           instruction to bring forth any additional info. Wonder why the suggestion seems to be it
           was improper to speak to Walt about safety concerns when it was public safety officials
           (Walt himself!) asking that additional info be shared w him if there was any.
