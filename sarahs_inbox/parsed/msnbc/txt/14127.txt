                Our supporting members are just as important as the active ones. We read the list often and knowing 144 sisters
                (a and a few brothers ) respect the organization enough to pay dues and come to the special activities. And, a job
                is one of the sisters values too and is the reason we ha the topic on the first session . Thank you for your words.

                 Well Sis,
                 It's good to know that you could step forward for the ANS it is a wonderful organization. I wish I had
                 more time time to commit but at my age I am lucky to have a good job. It gives me a positive feeling
                 to be able to work with troubled youth. My hours are swing hours and I can't seem to make a meeting
                 anymore but I want you to know that without the teachings of ANS and ANB I would not have
                 anything positive to add to anyones life. My heart still has ANB and ANS engraved on it and one day
                 soon I shall return but for now I am committed to my job. It has always been in my heart to give to
                 others what I have learned and I have learned not only to love and forgive but to laugh and smile too.
                 Good job sister.
                 Maureen

                  Subject: Acknowledgement; thank you ANS Camp 2!


                  I am extremely fortunate to have been able to be part of this women's
                  conference and was could not have done it without the following: Diane
                  Carrier, Sarah Lampe, my brother William, my sister Laura Sheldon and Myrna
                  Foster. These people are continually stepping forward to make things happen
                  for others . ANS must be proud of sister Sarah Lampe , Grand Camp Sargent At
                  Arms who made a trip over to help and who also brought the seal meat that
                  everyone enjoyed Saturday! I acknowledge President Micalyn Kunz McGhee and
                  her sister Nelly who were very much a part of this picture; they are true
                  inspiration of what ANS is all about . Thank you Connie for your continued
                  respect and for checking on items that needed to be done; you and Emma
                  really shined. I truly love my mom and after hearing her speak will make
                  more time for this wonderful lady so she can expect visits from me. I am
                  glad she is up front and personal ; you learn from the best. Last but
                  certainly not least I would like to personally acknowledge President Martin;
                  it is a blessing to be working under his leadership . His genuine concern
                  and support for Elders, youth, family, ANB/ANS and Southeast Native Veterans
                  shows his commitment in making our organization a good one.

                   I apologize for not making it in Saturday but had 9 grandchildren I was
                   caring for. Our day ended after the free swim for them after 8 PM.

                   I want to take this time and remind everyone that the last Native Issues
                   Forum is scheduled for April 9th; Senator Kookesh and Representative Bill
                   Thomas. MC Ron Williams. Our menu plans include entree items of Roast
                   w/gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cream style corn, spaghetti w/sauteed
                   onions, green peppers and celery , buttered dinner roll. Dessert: Cake
                   w/strawberry filling. Pork noodles, bac-o salad, macaroni salad, fruit salad
                   and hopefully fresh herring egg salad if it arrives in time from Sitka
                   (donated by Central Council ). Thank you!




                 Thank you.
