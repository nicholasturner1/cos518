               I wish he'd taken the offer to better serve the state by better utilizing his talents and connections
               with rural Alaska by accepting the ABC Board Ex Dir position- that way he'd be able to
               concentrate on bootlegging and the horrendous problems caused by alcohol in our rural
               communities. He's chosen not to accept that role in state service, but instead to exit state service
               entirely.

               I read what is on the ADL webpage. I think Sharon's response so far is good. I expect to get calls come
               Monday from the rural caucus and stakeholders in Rural Alaska and probably big native corps like AFN,
               CIRI, all the BB's, Pribilofs, Interior and Northwest.

               My stance is that it is not unusual for an Administration to change people out as the Governor sees
               appropriate to meet her goals for Alaska. Let me know if I need to say something different. tj
