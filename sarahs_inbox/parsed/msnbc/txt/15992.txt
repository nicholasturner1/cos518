         Randy,



         Linda,




          I'm writing to clarify my public records request: I'm requesting documents.the governor's
          office has sent to and received from KABATA since April 12. In particular, I'm looking for
          about 80 pages KABATA recently sent the state in response to a request for more
          information about the Knik Arm bridge project.




          Thanks,



          Kyle

         In your capacity as counsel for KABATA, please advise if I may release the most recent
         document provided by KABATA to Mr. Kyle Hopkins. That document contains responses to some
         of the due diligence questions posed by the administration to KABATA. It has been marked
         "Confidential Deliberative Process Privilege" by KABATA.   Mr. Hopkins of the Anchorage
         Daily News verbally requested a copy yesterday. I believe Kyle spoke to someone at KABATA
         yesterday and was told that KABATA did not object to the release of the document. If that
         is inaccurate and KABATA objects to the release of the document, you may also want to
         confirm with Kyle whether or not he wants to make a formal public records request for the,
         document from KABATA, and appeal KABATA's decision.




         Thanks,



         Randy
