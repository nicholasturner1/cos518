                Governor, please see below . Jon Dunham from our office is leading the charge on this . This might be good
                opportunity for you too. Click and I plan on being there . Kids and education. LEO


                This will be on April 30, 2008 at the Alaska State Fair Grounds in Palmer , centered around Raven Hall. We'll
                have 500 high school students from Anchorage and the Mat -Su attending - learning about career opportunities in
                the construction and transportation industry . We would like to have the Governor there to talk with the students at
                the same time that you and Commissioner Bishop will talk - starting at 8:45 AM, then at 10:15 AM and 11:30 AM.
