       We did discuss making the bill signing an event and requesting the participation of the
       companies.  I am not sure if there is much hope that the producers will participate,
       however we should at least have a general idea of our options. I asked Joe Balash to
       discuss with the team at their morning meeting tomorrow a strategy for approaching the
       companies.  We will make a recommendation on a location as well.

       Governor,

       Fairbanks sounds good to me - warm weather! Have you determined if you

       wish to make the AGIA bill signing an "event" by inviting potential

       applicants, or keep it lower key? If you decide to invite industry, we

       should begin to get it on their schedules.

                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0001960
