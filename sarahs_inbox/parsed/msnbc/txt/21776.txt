                 It's no prob at all for the decorations tomorrow. And the house looks beautiful! I can't wait for
                 the kids to see it. Thanks!

                   Hello!

                   That's just not right- who leaves Hawaii early??!!! Good decision though; it would be hard to relax and
                   enjoy the sun, warm sand, tropical smells , drinks w little umbrellas... Now you'll just need to go back!! :)

                   It would be cool if they were able to meet up- Alex was all happy when he found out you guys would be
                   there-and so close! The kid would probably run 5 miles if he had too, he's such a goof!

                   Did you see my note about decorators on Monday (9-4) it's no problem to reschedule , but I wanted to
                   check with you before I made any calls.

                   Hi E-
                   I hope Bristol found Alex. I think our hotels are just a few doors down.

                   I hustled back to Juneau early- felt to guilty and nervous being away w/special session ... so I'm here. Todd
                   and kids stayed for the wedding that is tonight , they'll return to Anchorage late Tuesday. It was flippin'
                   GORGEOUS there!

                  I'm paraphrasing of course, but he was very thoughtful and wise. H fin is still going strong tonight.
