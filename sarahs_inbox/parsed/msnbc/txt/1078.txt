Subject: Parental Consent abortion bill




Sharon and Rosanne may need to think of some messaging re: the parental consent bill also, after it
progressed so well in other body and committees then Lyda 's coalition killed it. Unbelievable . Truly, if
voters understood how measures like this get killed amidst selfish political power struggles, they'd be
up in arms . Is Dahlstrom , et al, ticked about this?

That's ridiculous! 2 formal hearing requests were submitted in the last week alone and numerous
others during this entire year the bill has been stuck in S FIN.. When that wasn't working Kris worked
w Emil and Ted to get the ball rolling.

I wonder if I ever had that lunch with the Homer bidder. Yikes- does anyone remember?

 Frank- did you see wesley's blog on biz lic? Shoot. Don't know who's idea it was, but it was all about
transparency! Letting alaskans know who was sitting on important bills(s). Stedman's comment was
the email shouldn't have been sent, instead the chairman should have been requested to move it!
What a joke. How many times was he asked to move it? Well maybe the blog/story will give the issue
publicity and the follow up can open a door to also speak about tire tax and other good bills they're
still trying to kill because they're either greedy spenders and/or they hate to see our name on
anything that could pass. I wish Mike wouldn't have given a "no comment" comment in reply to
wesley's questions on this.

Reminds me of the Homer Library luncheon where Lt Gov Leman 's lunch barely fetched $200, and
Candidate Palin's lunch fetched $650 for the Library Foundation.



John and Nicole? Harris is married??

 Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items was a
package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch w/Binkley and his
wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It
was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500. :)
