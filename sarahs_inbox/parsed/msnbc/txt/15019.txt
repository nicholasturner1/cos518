            MESSAGE:

            Dear Sarah, The Associated Press ran a beautiful article about your family in our Saint
            Paul newspaper. Congratulations to you and your family on the birth of your son! As the
            mother six,one a special needs son, I can tell you this child will bring you more joy
            than you can ever imagine! Have you read the story, "Welcome to Holland"? Beautiful.
            Your husband sounds like a real gem asking, "why not us?" What a great dad! We too are a
            very pro-life family. Thank you for being a voice for the unborn and their mothers and
            fathers. Sincerely, db
