              MESSAGE:

              Glad to see you as a Republican, cleaning house so to speak. I am not registered with any
              party, although I do vote Republican. We do need something clean in the political arena
              that people can respect. Our politicians need to be of the highest ethics possible. Even
              if it only seems there are very few "clean" politicians. The more the better. If it hints
              of being unethical, it probably is. You keep on the straight and narrow. Thanks. John
              Allison
