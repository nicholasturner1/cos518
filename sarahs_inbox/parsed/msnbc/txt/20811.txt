          Hi Governor.  We've received a number of public records requests and press inquiries
          regarding polar bears and predator control, but nothing out of the ordinary (other than
          the number and frequency).



          You and I should probably meet sometime, if you get a chance, with Doug Larsen to go over
          possible plans for predator control this coming year. And, there are some issues on the
          early-October North Pacific Fishery Management Council meeting agenda (like halibut
          charter allocations) that Cora and I could use your guidance or opinions on.



           But things are going well.



           Good luck out there, DL.

          Hi guys! Checkin in. I anticipate folks will be inquiring about our polar bear issue,
          though it hasnt cropped up yet that I've heard of.

                                                                1

             Climate change is a top issue of course. Just head ' s up. Also, predator control's been
           quiet, but let me know if the issue ' s volume gets turned up and I need to respond to
           anything . Thanks guys ! Hang in there... I appreciate you sincerely.
