          I can't find that reference from Baldino. Pls find her specific quote so you can give to
          Sharon so she can (again) correct the 10 pm's mistake.

          Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll ask Sharon to check on
          what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check. I said weeks ago
          "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate. Those who were with me at
          the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

           don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
           from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
           don't know how you navigate this , but the press will pick up on it and try to further
           shove a wedge between you and ted .  just wanted you to be aware.
