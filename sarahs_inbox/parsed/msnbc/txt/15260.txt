              Can you check with Mike Barnhill and see if there are any deadlines we need to be aware of?

              I also spoke with Kelley Goode regarding the special session bill files. She stated that the hold-up was
              that she was awaiting a green light from the AGIA team . I told her that we would open bill files as soon as
              we got approval from her. I also told her that I could send her an e-mail with the list of bill files to open
              and that as soon as we got a confirming e-mail from her , we would open them.

              Mike B.
