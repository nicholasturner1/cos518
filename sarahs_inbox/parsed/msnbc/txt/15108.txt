          Those are my sleepless cents.         I think there are two of them there.

           Governor - This just came in as a scheduling request. I have attached the original signed
           letter.  Janice



           05.09.08



           We are writing to request that you meet with us in person about the energy crisis
           affecting our home and neighbors , as well as our whole state . Today we received a letter
           from General Campbell, but it does not cover all our concerns and we feel it is still
           critical to discuss these issues with you personally.



           The community of Juneau faces a steep increase in our electricity costs due to losing 1.5
           miles of line and several transmission towers from our hydroelectric power plant at
           Snettisham.  It has been estimated that our electricity costs will be increased by 500%
           for one month and 350% for two additional months.



           The economic impact this will have on our residents, small businesses, and nonprofit
           organizations is huge.  A small business that normally has a $1,000 electric bill will
           have $9,000 in additional costs that were not budgeted, and a household which normally has
           a $100 electric bill during the spring months will have $900 in additional costs. Very
           few businesses and households have the money available to fill that gap.



          Our offices have been contacted by cozens of citizens and businesses who are deeply
          concerned about their ability to survive the increase. In addition, we are incredibly
          concerned about our local school district, which estimates its additional energy costs to
          be in the neighborhood of $400,000 , money we are sure everyone would rather see spent on
          textbooks and teachers.



          While we-have not seen these increases yet, the entire community is poised on the edge and
          we are readying ourselves for this hit.  We know the impact will be devastating.  We
          expect the three-month crises will extract $18-20 million from Juneau's economy in direct
          costs alone.
                                                                                                             N

          We are very aware of the energy crisis facing all of A^aska .  We want to be part of the
          solution, and we think we have worthwhile ideas that will lead us forward. We hope that
          you will bee with us so that together we can work to help not only Juneau , but our whole
          state.
