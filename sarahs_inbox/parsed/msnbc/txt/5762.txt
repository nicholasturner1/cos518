       She just made a bunch of banana bread. We'll send that over in a basket-can do juice too
       if that sounds good... unless we hear otherwise. Thanks, E

       Could u ask her to prepare something that I could bring to Sen. Dyson's morning meeting
       tomorrow in his office? It's a morning mtg that I'd guess includes about 20 people- I'll
       check for sure but we'll assume 20 for now. Thanks
