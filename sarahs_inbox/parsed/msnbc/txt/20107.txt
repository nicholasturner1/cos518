              Subject: Energy Package -- Administration's position

              Good morning Governor,

              The energy team is working with the House and Senate Finance Committees today . There are many
              elements being discussed at the table and the committees now want the Administration 's position with the
              goal of moving a bill out this afternoon.

              Right now there is an expansion of PCE
              A subsidy for bulk home heating fuel over $3.00 per gallon up to 600 gallons administered by AEA
              A rebate check - no dollar determined yet between $250 and $1000
              LIHEAP - state and federal income based public assistance for heating costs

              Only the H version includes the 8cents motor fuel suspension right now.

             We will obviously work to encourage a rebate check of at least $800, trying for higher if possible. We will
             continue for fuel tax suspension but no sure Senate will agree.

              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


             We need to work with the committees very soon and Randy will need to have a comment at the table later
             today.

             Thanks, Kelly
