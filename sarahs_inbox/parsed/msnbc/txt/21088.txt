             To my knowledge, Congressman Young has not opined on the Convention perhaps
             because the House has no role in the ratification process.

             Senators Stevens and Murkowski are both supportive. However, Senator Lisa has
             been more outspoken recently, because she actually sits on the Senate Foreign
             Relations Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Convention.

             My sense is that the Republican leadership in the Senate is growing impatient with the
             opponents of the Convention. Therefore, I expect the Committee to schedule a
             ratification vote sometime soon.

            Whether the Convention will actually get to the floor this year is less clear, as floor time
            is difficult to come by, and the opponents will be loud even if their numbers are small.
            I would expect both of our Senators to advocate for ratification at that time.

            The Senate is now shooting for a November 16th adjournment date, which may be
            more of a wish than a realistic goal.

             Called Amy's home/work #'s and sent her an email. Also left a mssg for Dan to find out if
             packets & notifications were sent out yesterday as planned.

             You should NOT have to ask on these several times. I'm so frustrated when you have to do it
             with other people, so it is a small failure when you have to do it with me. Last thing I want to be
             is someone you have to spend extra time on. I'm supposed to be support, not a draw of energy.

             Have a great day!
