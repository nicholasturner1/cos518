                Within 5 days of the Legislature convening on January 16...so January 22 at the latest . However, the Regents
                have a retreat to plan their Legislative priorities on January 19 and 20 and it would be great to have your new
                Regents there.

                 Ivy,
                 Thank you for considering me for the "Regents, University of Alaska Board of'. At this time, I
                 am not interested in this appointment . Ivy, please express my appreciation to Sarah for
                 consideration. This is not the right position at this particular time.
                 I do wish to "Serve" Alaska in some capacity in the future . Sarah is going to be an awesome
                 Gov. and if I can work in a way to help complete her vision, I would be happy to do so . I would
                 consider other assignments in the future, should there be a need.
