               Hey Frank:

               Here's a huge "thanks" for helping me get this appointment. I am so psyched to serve on this council with all
               these wonderful people, and I look forward to becoming a part of the solution concerning our homeless
               challenge here in Alaska . Please let Governor Palin know I really appreciate her appointing me.

               Oh, I sat behind your wife a couple Sundays ago at the 1 : 30 service . She says she remembers having a husband
               once! O j/k (She conveyed you were in Juneau and very busy during the session.)

               Jeff

               Good morning,
               On behalf of the Governors' Council on the Homeless, I'd like

               8/28/2009


                                                                                                                      PRA GSP01_0012463

               to welcome you as newly appointed members . You join myself
               and the other Council members , Commissioners Joe Schmidt,
               Corrections , Karleen Jackson , Health and Social Services,
               Walt Monegan , Public Safety , Barbara Thompson , Education
               and Jeff Jessee , Executive Director of the Alaska Mental
               Health Trust Authority in a very important effort to provide
               housing to those Alaskans who find themselves homeless, or
               on the verge of becoming homeless.
               Homelessness is not a character flaw. It is the consequence of
               the many important social issues that face us; substance
               abuse , mental illness, domestic violence, lack of affordable
               housing , catastrophic illness and the movement towards lower
               paying service related jobs in the economy . We have
               legislation moving through the legislature to create a housing
               trust account within AHFC to address the needs of the
               homeless and affordable housing in general . HB324 and
               SB231 have been heard in House and Senate HESS
               committees and Senate Finance . We look forward to our first
               hearing in House Finance soon. We will keep you updated as
               to the progress of this legislation and the scheduling for the
               first Governor's Council meeting.
               In the mean time if you have any questions , please give me a
               call at 330-8452 , or call Mark Romick , Director of Planning and
               Program Development at 330-8274
               or mromick __ahfc. state.ak.us and he can give you background
               information on the Council and its work to date.
               Sincerely,
               Dan Fauske
               Chairman
               Governor's Council on the Homeless
