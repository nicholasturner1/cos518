           Governor - we had discussed this last week. I          just want to confirm that you will not be
           available for this 4 day trip with Trig. So,           Todd and parents would be attending. The
           other option for you would be just to fly you          in for a day and out - but they still do not
           encourage bringing Trig away from the camp so          that would mean someone would stay at camp
           the day you fly in with him. Thanks, Janice
