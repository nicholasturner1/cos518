  Former Murkowski chief of staff pleads guilty to corruption charges

  ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Jim Clark, the former chief of staff to Gov. Frank Murkowski, has
  pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy.

  The charges stem from an ongoing federal investigation into public corruption of Alaska
  politicians.

  Specifically, the plea agreement indicates that Clark committed mail and wire fraud in order
  to advance a "scheme" in which VECO Corp. would eventually pay more than $68,000 in
  expenses relating to Gov. Murkowski's re-election campaign.

  The charges go on to say that the scheme was hatched so that the public would "be
  deceived and the payments would not be disclosed, as required by law."

  The charges stem from the 2006 Petroleum Profits Tax debate in the state Legislature. Two
  former state lawmakers, Pete Kott and Vic Kohring, have already been found guilty of
  corruption-related charges stemming from the PPT 20/20 debate.
