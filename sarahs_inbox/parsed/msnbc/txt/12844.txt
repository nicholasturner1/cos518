             extension funding




            Governor:



            I would like to follow up with week with Joe Perkins on the comments that the USCG will
            not issue a permit for placing the terminal at the Port where Mayor Begich wants it. If
            that is the position of the USCG, I would like to get a letter from the Commander or
            person in charge of permitting that says as much. We could then attach that letter and
            possibly a letter from the Corps outlining the $5 million a year in dredging costs to our
            letter of support for the project to be built at Ship Creek. This would clearly show that
            Mayor Begich is being unreasonable.



           Mayor Menard invited me to attend the next mediation session with Senator Murkowski's
           staff in Anchorage.  If it is alright with you, I would like to attend. While there, I
           will also meet with central region DOT personnel and review a plat of the area to see if
           there are any other options nearby. (Although it sounds like the Mat-Su folks have
           already reviewed this, they may have missed something).



           On the rail extension to Port Mackenzie, it seems like a great project. I would like to
           check with the Railroad and find out why they are not putting any of the federal funding
           they receive each year into the project. (I think they average $50-60 million a year)



           Thanks,

                                                                    1
