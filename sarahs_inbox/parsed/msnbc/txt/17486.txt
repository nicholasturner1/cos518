       Governor, you are scheduled to be in Juneau Mon-Wed, to Anch Wed night, Glennallen Thurs-
       Friday next week. I'm not sure when we want to do a press conference in Anchorage, unless
       you go up Wednesday morning instead of Wednesday night and do the press conference on
       Wednesday in the afternoon at the Anchorage Governor's Office. Right now your schedule is
       clear for Wednesday so we could do this. The girls are booked on the eve flight with you,
       but we could send you in the a.m. and them in the p.m., right?

       I'm game be we should be leading on this issue and not having to rely on my mayoral
       colleagues to wake up the legislature to my campaign promise. My msg will be positive -
       about the great "opportunity" the state has to trickle down the people's wealth to the
       most resposive, local govt.



       Don't know how Begich will phrase it but,I'm going positive.
