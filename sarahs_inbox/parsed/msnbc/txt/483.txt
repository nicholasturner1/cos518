Subject: Trips with Fish and Game




Governor:




I want to extend an open invitation to you, Todd, and members of your staff to visit or participate in
any of the activities, field camps, special use areas , or surveys conducted or managed by the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game. For example, as commissioner I am allowed to issue special permits
for visitors (outside of the regular public lottery) to the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary for world-
class viewing of coastal brown bears. Also, we conduct a number of interesting field projects (e.g.,
moose and caribou aerial surveys, radio-tagging of northern pike, stream-walk spawning surveys for
salmon, medicinal baiting of wolves, etc.) that you could visit and join in. Your participation would not
only be a boon to ADF&G staff, but also a way for you to become more acquainted with our programs
and to see some of the lesser-visited portions of Alaska.
                                                      1                             ROSTON 00292

Some particular ideas include:




In a few weeks, the department in conjunction with the Hunter Heritage Foundation is conducting a
weekend workshop of training activities called "Becoming an Outdoors Woman." BOW has become
a very popular program, and I will be attending a portion of this June's program (June 15-17) at Lost
Lake south of Fairbanks. As Alaska's premier "outdoors woman" you would certainly be a welcome
addition to this, or any future, program. Soon, we will likely be holding a BOW training session in
Southeast Alaska. For information, please see:
http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/Region3/Programs/BOW/BOWhome.cfm




While this year's permits have already been issued, if you would like to visit the McNeil River bear-
viewing program in lower Cook Inlet, I would be happy to reserve slots for you next year. For more
information, see: http://www.wildlife. alaska .gov/index.cfm?adfg=mcneil_river.main




Or, perhaps we could arrange a trip for you and Todd this year or next to visit the Round Island
(Walrus Islands) State Game Sanctuary, west of Togiak, in association with your fishing season in
Dillingham: http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=refuge.rnd_is




Or, perhaps a trip into the upper portions of the Bristol Bay drainages , to witness some of Alaska's
premier trout sport fisheries : http://www. sf.adfg . state.ak . us/region2/areas/index.cfm/FA/BB.overview

Another trip idea would be to visit Kodiak, perhaps meet with fishermen, and then fly by charter to the
south end of the Island to view the set gill net and purse seine sockeye salmon fishery enroute to our
Frazer Lake fishpass, where there are not only brown bears but also thousands of sockeye salmon
ascending a fish ladder around a natural barrier falls. While passing through Kodiak city, it might be
possible to arrange a short trip on a small, local trawl or longline vessel, as well as visit some of the
state and federal research and management facilities. For a bit on the Frazer facility and program:
http://vvww.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/region4/finfish/salmon/kodiak/frazer res.php




This fall you might be interested in joining me on a potential trip to the Noatak and Kobuk Rivers, out
of Kotzebue, in order to see the massive Northwest Arctic caribou herd and to see firsthand some of
the contentious guide/outfitter/subsistence hunter conflicts occurring in that part of the state. And,
there are certainly opportunities for me to help arrange for you to visit any of the national parks,
national wildlife refuges, etc. around the state.




More locally, there are opportunities for day trips, say to our fish wheel salmon counting program at
Canyon Island on the Taku River south of Juneau in the mountains near the US/Canada border, or to
our weir and fish wheel programs on the Chilkat and Chilkoot Rivers near Haines, overflights of some
of the local commercial fisheries, or visits to local salmon hatcheries.




If any of this strikes your fancy, please let me know, and we will work to accommodate your schedule
and preferences.
