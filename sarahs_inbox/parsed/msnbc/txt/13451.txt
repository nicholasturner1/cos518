            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

            We are from Upstate NY with great interests in Alaska's news.. .Our oldest/Faith is
            stationed in Cordova as an officer on the USCGC Sycamore and our son/Graham graduates from
            West Point next month to be an officer at Fort Wainwright.

            Today we write b/c of our youngest daughter/Libby - who has severe cerebral
            palsy... secondary to being a beautifully strong and talented 19yr old. To make a long
            story short - Faith and Graham are doing so well b/c of the strength they have developed
            thru their love of sister Libby. We feel your comment RE: Trig's birth ("We have faith
            that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better
            place. We are truly blessed.") was so powerful and will impact communities and support
            families. in 19+yrs, we have never been so moved or inspired as your faithful and
            refreshing comment has made us feel. No mission statement from any agency/school/advocacy
            group... could of said it better than you have; we are 'family first' and 'child first'.
            God Bless little Trig and his family. SIncerely. The Reynolds Family
