          Subject: Wooten' s moose




          Yep, that transcript sounds like something Wooten would say.

            He.claims Chuck Heath was going to take Molly's tag and shoot a moose with it? Not true.
          I recall that Chuck Heath was offering to take Molly hunting since the season was coming
          to a close and Wooten had still not taken the time to take her hunting so she could fill
          the tag. Chuck Heath wasn't going to "shoot a moose, period", as Wooten claims. And after
          the hunt Wooten told Chuck Heath that Molly DID shoot that moose, which wasn't true. As
          WPD officer Chris Watchus testified (he was the hunting partner in the boat as Wooten
          illegally shot the animal from a motorized vehicle, which is also illegal), Wooten did not
          give Molly a chance to shoot it before he fired. Afterwards, Wooten threatened Molly that
          she'd better not tell anyone, but people eventually found out about it after Wooten
          bragged about the hunt.

          Yes, I've received Tier 2 permits and I have filled my tags, with friends and family
          witnessing the hunts. It appears from the transcript that Wooten states to his fellow
          union member/internal investigator re: Chuck Heath "... He does it every year (with)
          Sarah's caribou tag." Not true. And Wooten has NEVER hunted with me, and except for his
          illegal moose hunt in question he has never hunted moose or caribou with family, so his
          accusation that Chuck Heath takes caribou on my, or others, permits every year is not
          based on fact.

             Pls let me know commissioners availability on all this today. In trying to coordinate over the
             weekend it seemed a wednesday event was possible but I haven't heard back definitively from
             anyone yet. Cabinet could coincide with AGIA and Energy decisions w legislature. Hopefully
             my emails were received:

             Governor,
             The Senate schedule is very uncertain and will not fine up until after the Senate has their caucus meeting on
             Monday morning (@ 11:O0am, I'm told). Therefore I think whatever date works for you for your Cabinet meeting
             will be fine. I do want to reiterate the message Tom sent to you last night, that we do need you here in Juneau early
             next week to start working Legislators before the. AGIA vote. Let me know if there is anything you would like me
             to do for'you.
             Thanks for checking on the schedule.
             Marty

             Marry: I'd like cabinet members to be down there to support AGIA team, touch base with leggies, etc this week- we
             can turn the visit into a cabinet meeting luncheon. Does Thursday sound good? Or before that?

             J- I forgot- it's wedding day, don't turn that bb on and don't answer emails! :) give Hannah and Jake a hug from the
             Palins today!
               Mike - let's plan cabinet mtg in the form of a luncheon at the house this week, if we can assume enough members
             can be in Juneau. It's a historic week if the AGIA vote is taken, so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that (and
             in support of AGIA team). We can do a bit of an informal lunch w/roundtable setting and we'll literally go around
             the tables getting updates from everyone of their dept activities.

             Oh! At first I thought it was Track and that he was surprising me by saying he was putting Dad on the phone for

             Governor,

              Alex thought I was working late at the House and I think he called and got you... Thinking it was HIS mom- he
             gave the phone to Brent- who thought my friend & I were joking with him- Brent was thoroughly confused... so he
             hung up. So if that's the strange call you got just a bit ago... sorry about that- it was my goofy family.

             I can't wait to see your kids & mom tomorrow!
