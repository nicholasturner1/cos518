          Governor:



          It's just crossing the Juneau newswires here, but apparently Deputy Commissioner of
          Revenue Brian Andrews and his son are missing and overdue from a trip in a Cessna 182 to a
          lake about 20 miles from Juneau. USCG is searching with a helicopter now. It's been
          pretty foggy here all day. The Juneau Empire has some information posted on its website.

                 Subject:                                  08.12.08 Arctic Parliamentarian Remarks


                 Governor,



                 Here are your remarks for the Arctic Parliamentarian conference in Fairbanks on Tuesday.
                 Melissa will have all your information printed out for you and ready to go .    I will get
                 the event info to you tomorrow , as I am still waiting for the final agenda from Sen.
                 Murkowski ' s office . I should have it to you no later than tomorrow afternoon.



                 CONTEXT FOR THE REMARKS: you will be speaking at the Arctic Parliamentarian's conference
                 in Fairbanks on Tuesday, August 12. Sen. Lisa Murkowski will be there, along with
                 parliamentarian delegates from Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and
                 Sweden.  About 150 are expected to be present. The delegates are meeting for three days
                 to hear speakers on the three key topics of:




                 -Human Health in the Arctic

                 -Adaptation to Climate Change

                 -Development of Energy Resources in the Arctic



                 I had originally been told you had 15 minutes to speak; I have since been informed that
                 you and the three others giving welcome speeches are actually LIMITED TO FIVE MINUTES. As
                 you will be so short on time, your remarks focus mainly on the topic of Arctic energy
                 resource' development.



                 Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have. Thanks so much!
