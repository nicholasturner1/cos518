              Governor,

              Kurt and I have developed an "action plan" for tomorrow and we wanted you to be aware from the gasline
              side.

              Fagan was especially harsh and untruthful on the air today . He asked his listeners to call three Senators
              who are "on the fence" and convert them so that AGIA dies . Among them: Con, Lyman, and Gary
              Stevens . And he says that Donny will vote whichever way Lyman does . Bob Lester says he is going to do
              a call your Senator to vote "yes" on AGIA. I would assume Mark may do the same . Our plan is to have
              Dan Fauske call Fagan early afternoon and say that he and Kurt are going to be in the neighborhood just
              before 4pm and will stop by to go on the air from 4p to 5p . Hopefully Fagan will let them in. It is our feeling
              that you need someone on the air with Fagan to counter the shenanigans. He was waaaaay over the top
              today.

              Re: gasline briefing. A gasline team member will record this week if that's okay with you. We feel that it's
              important a message go out tomorrow and we are basing our message on the misleading BP letter to
              Senators. We will certainly make sure that you know the contents of that briefing.

              Rosanne asked for an AGIA Update for the newsletter that will be heading out either tomorrow or
              sometime in the next couple of days. Below is the copy which Kurt and I submitted to her . Its an FYI for
              you.

              Please let us know if you have any other thoughts re: communications.

              Thanks,
              Meg
