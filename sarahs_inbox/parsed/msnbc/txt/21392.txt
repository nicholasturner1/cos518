                 Governor:

                 Here is a copy of your AFN speech.

                 I've copied the commissioners whose programs are highlighted.
                 If they have any comments or changes, I'll ask that they send them to me no later than noon tomorrow
                 (Tuesday, Oct. 23) and I'll consolidate all of the edits for you.
