           Yeah, Steve Quinn is following up on this. He's particularly interested in legislators
           traveling to China with ANGDA this month (Harris, Huggins, and Ramras)--wanting to know if
           any state funds are used for this trip.



           He's also going to check in with Leg Affairs to get a list of trips from last year--his
           angle being Harris and Green will pick up the tab to send their members to vaious energy
           conferences across the country, including Energy Council, yet Harris won't reimburse for
           traveling to a three day information session on the gasline applicant he and his members
           will consider and vote on. fb--can you let dennis know he can request this same info from
           leg affairs.

           Folks are digging into Steven's current trip to Belgium on state dime, and his trips to
           Puerto Rico, other Leg's travel...contrasting that with Harris/Green not reimbursing folks
                                                                  1

            We're working on a story about the travel. I have David from APRN helping out. They have a
            guy in Juneau going through records. D
