             No problem-take everything!!   I was going to order pizza for their next work day. I can
             meet him and pack stuff up if you want.

              :)

             Hi!  Tom is running over to the house for me to grab sandwich-making stuff so I can feed
             the few staffers who are here (ACES team, basically) on Vet's Day today.



             I now realize the meat and bread may be for Rep Women's group? if I took their food for
             our lunch, I'll replace it!
