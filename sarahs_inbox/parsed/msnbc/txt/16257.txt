           If you have a chance to look at your calendar on the July 9 departure from ANC - let me
           know if you want to do that Wed. Evening or the next day Thur. Evening departure. You
           will be out of state either 5 or 6 full days. I will then put Bristol on same flights.
           Thank you, Janice
