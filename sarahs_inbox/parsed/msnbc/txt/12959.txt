                Governor,  the 30 day public notice for changing the 2 cycle ban from 2010 to 2013 was
               completed March 7.  There were only 8 comments this time with 4 supporting the 2013 date.
               In fact the Kenai Area Fisherman's Coalition who fought the first ban said this was an
               acceptable compromise.  Two wanted it left at 2010 and two were neutral. I have signed
               the 2013 adoption order, that will go to law and then to the Lt Gov for filing. if you
               have any questions please let me know.   Tom
