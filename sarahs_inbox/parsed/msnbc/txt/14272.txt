           Dear Governor Palin-




           I just read about the birth of your new son, Trig, and I wanted to congratulate you and
           your husband and older children. Thank you for being a powerful witness to the truth that
           each child is precious and a gift to our world.



           Sincerely,

           Jeannine DeGeorges
