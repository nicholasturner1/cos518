             Like, Janice, I can't tell which of my emails bounced back yesterday so I wanted to be
             sure you got my note yesterday morning about Nelson Cohen, US Attorney, wanting to pay a
             courtesy call on you while he is in Juneau this week. (He was on yesterday's flight) It
             was about how he's here for a Coast Guard exercise, some Forest Service business and he
             says he was stopping in to see Talis about the US Attorneys opening an office in Juneau.
             Did you get that email??
