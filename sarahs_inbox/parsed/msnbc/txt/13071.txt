                Subject: Senator Murkowski Lunch


               I understand that you had lunch with Senator Murkowski yesterday. I'm not
               prying, but just wanted to know how it went and whether there is anything that we
               should follow-up on from here.

               I was pleased with Senator Stevens' recent clarification on earmarks but have
               concluded that there is nothing more we can do to change the inaccurate
               perceptions of the Voice of the Times on the State's earmark policy.
