              Revenue probably knew it was coming (or surmised it) when the savings plan was put
              together???? That's only a guess.

              Was it just coincidence the $379m from BP amount is the exact same amount already
              announced to go into the CBR?




              Also, read an article on $4.5m in budget going towards planning new state                  museum? I need
              more details on that.
