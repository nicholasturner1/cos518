                 We have been talking in terms of ACES kicking off a new era of stability.

                Lt. Governor,

                I just concluded a meeting and I see that Beth was able to locate the letter . I am still in the office with Pat Galvin
                and if there is anything we can do, please let me know . You might find it interesting that a fair amount of time was
                spent in committee today talking about whether ACES would help or hurt our ability to bridge the gap until we find
                another substantial source of revenue (i.e. gas pipeline ). Pat did a great job at describing our two step process of
                (1) making sure we obtain an equitable share of the resource and (2) saving for the future. He responded several
                times to questions that ACES is not a spending bill but in order to save for the future, we need the revenue. Pat
                testified that clearly ACES helps us bridge the gap. Living within our means and saving for the future has always
                been the foundation of our fiscal plan.

                 Did you see the letter to the governor from the Anchorage Chamber dated October 22, 2007, re ACES. I'm
                 speaking to the Anchorage Chamber lunch on Monday and plan to address their points on ACES, turning
                 them on their head. Was wondering who you had working on a response and whether I could coordinate
                 some messaging with them.
