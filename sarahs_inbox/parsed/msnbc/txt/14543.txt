          HB 370 is sponsored by Rep Kelly, titled DAMAGE TO FORESTS/ WILDLAND FIRES. The bill
           modifies state law regarding fighting wildfires by allowing DNR to consider the value of
          infrastructure (including cabin, lodges, etc) at risk when making decisions on fighting
          fires, rather than just the value of the natural resources.



          The change would bring the law more in line with how the department already deals with
          wildfires, according to a presser from Kelly's office. The bill doesn't force the state to
          protect public and private buildings, but allows them to be considered in the decision-
          making process.



          DNR supported this bill; there's no fiscal impact.                It's not sexy, but helpful for DNR.
