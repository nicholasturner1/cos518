  Subject: Willow's travel to Anchorage
 Hi Kari and Kris,

 My understanding is that Willow will be arriving in Juneau this Thursday and she will be flying to Anchorage
 on Friday (6/8). I did not see any family events up in the Anchorage area listed on the calendar- between now
 and when they travel back this way for the Ketchikan and Juneau events (6/16 and 6/18). Do either of you
 know of ANY family events that are not on the calendar? I'm sure there's something I'm not aware of, but
 since Willow's TAs originate from Juneau I'll need a purpose before I can have a ticket purchased.

 Todd, do I have Willow's travel dates correct? Do you have a preference on which flight she takes? I assume
 the earlier the better.

 Thank youforyour he p!
 Erika
