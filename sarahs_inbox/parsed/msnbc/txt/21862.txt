           Have Kate cont this- as I didn't even know Beth was working on it... And I'd rather have
           heart-felt short/sweet Kate comments. Thanks!

           Hi,

           I haven't mentioned this to Kate yet as I wanted to get some direction from you first.
           Kate was under the impression that you wanted her to write comments for your (and my)
           Right to Life Banquet appearance around November 24th. As I understand it, Beth has
           already drafted your comments, obtained the AG's input, etc. [I've been talking solely
           with Talis.] Seems like I need to take Kate off the project at this point but I wondered
           if you had other designs in mind before I talk with her???
