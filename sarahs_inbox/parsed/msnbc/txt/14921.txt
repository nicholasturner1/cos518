           my'wife and i were lucky enough to have had a downs baby girl. she was the light of our
           lives. I was 23 my wife 21 when jodie leigh was born.no matter how much love you give
           her, she will give you more back in more ways than you can count, it sounds like you are
           already a wonderful person,but i gaurantee she will show you and your outher children what
           a family bond is truly like. my only advice don't treat her any different than your outher
           children,don't pity her.let your little angel have all the independence she wants' don't
           ever try to hold her back,she will learn and want to be her own person.If you ever want to
           talk please call and i can help you have a wonder life with your gift, since i have
           already been there.  charles
