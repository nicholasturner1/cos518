              Just fyi- we ended up with one too many rooms because the rollaway can fit into the second
              room- so I .cancelled the one.



             And again to confirm we're not looking at the king air for tomorrow, don't know it's
             status for Monday's return to Juneau but assume that will be commercial also?
