            I think it is a great idea. Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA pre-briefing at the
            mansion in January 07.

            How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of them will be in
            Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have made ourselves available in such
            a setting for a long time - we need to!

              Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum they can
            appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like the gov's house events
            they've been a part of). Please let me know asap. Thanks
