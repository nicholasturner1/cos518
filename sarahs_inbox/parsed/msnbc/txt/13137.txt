           Well - I know the Governor Signs things for whoever asks - is there something in
           particular that he is asking for her to sign. I have not heard from him before - we
           always sign whatever they are asking...

           Janice, what do you think? Should I write him back and say no, or do you think the
           Governor would be willing to sign something for him?

           To Whom It May Concern,



           Hello. Can you tell me if the Governor signs authentic autographs through the mail? I've
           written several times through the mail and then tried email. I've either received no reply
           or a pre -printed autograph . Now I live in North Carolina and wondered if a NC address
           would have less chance of receiving a reply. Should I try writing again? If so, please let
           me know . If genuine autographs aren ' t provided through the mail, I didn't want to keep
           wasting letters and stamps . Thanks for your time and your assistance. Keep up the good
           work . I hope to get back to my home state for a visit this year . Take care.




           Regards,



           Jim Gillespie

                   Governor:

                  I think it was Frank who asked if you would send a condolence letter to Marti Nashoanak,
                  who works in my department and with the Commissioner's office staff. She was brought to
                  tears by your thoughtfulness and it meant a great deal to her and her extended family that
                  you and Todd expressed your sorrow at the loss of her adult daughter.

                   She wanted to send a thank you to you and I told her I'd be glad to forward it on to you.

                   Governor Sarah Palin and family,

                   I've just received your wonderful letter of condolence.

                  I would like to thank you for walking with my family during this very difficult Journey.

                  This journey would have been unbearable without the prayer and loving support from our
                  family and friends.

                   Thank You!

                  Marti Nashoank
