            I will. Sean's office asked me the same question but when I asked a number of questions , Jay did not have a single
            answer. I need to talk to DOR and DNR to see what meetings are scheduled . I will let you know as soon as I learn
            more.

            Would you touch base w/sean on this after it 's concluded that the trip is a good idea? I dont even know who they'd
            be meeting with?

            No problem , I wont confirm or go until I hear from you that it's ok.

            And, I'll prod the team to do a better job of helping you make contact.

            Let me ask Mike about it as I've heard nothing . In fact, I'm still waiting
            to hear gasline team 's plan for my "outreach " to companies via travels or at
            least phone calls. Still havent heard from them on it! I may just go with
            my gut and start the contacts on my own.

           I had a message from Marcia Davis to our office regarding the possibility of
           me accompanying team members on another trip to Houston /Dallas this next
           week. She hasn't given us company names or timeframe but I can likely make
           the trip. Is this something you want me doing if they are asking??
