          Governor Hickel & Malcolm,

          It is with extreme disappointment that I send this email. I am speaking about the
          BackBone III flyer you just sent to all 60 Alaska Legislators. And I know many other
          people share my indignation and disgust.



          It is totally inappropriate to imply that good government doesn't allow for differing
          opinions.  And it is totally wrong to imply that the Palin Administration isn't working
          around the clock to protect the State of Alaska, and every individual Alaskans' interests.



          We are a state that has amazing potential, with many options available to us. To suggest
          that choosing a gasline option that differs from your vision is somehow corrupt is so
          wrong.  And it ignores the reality - which is that we can do both projects! The AGIA
          project will allow an LNG option to proceed if there is market interest in doing so.
          Nothing in AGIA limits the LNG interests.
                                                                  1




                                                                                                                PRA GSP01_0020738

          It is beyond imagination and good taste that you have chosen to use individuals names as
          supporting your position without first getting their permission , or who are regretfully
          not alive to have participated in the AGIA discussion.



          Most of all, I am totally and irrevocably disgusted in the insinuation that Marty
          Rutherford or the Gasline Team has anything but the highest standards in achieving what
          this state needs, which is a fair, open and transparent process. In fact you have
          previously commended them for looking out for Alaska's interests. Now I can only that
          your definition of looking out for Alaska's interests only means doing what you think is
          best.



          Finally, I believe a public apology to Marty Rutherford and the Gasline Team is
          appropriate.  They are the best people we could have representing this state.



          This a sad day,

          Tom Irwin
