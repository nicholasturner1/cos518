                 Dear Mrs. Palin.

                            You recently said on the news that if I were thinking of droping out of
                 school that I should contact you. Well, I do not enjoy the life of schooling. I am,
                 as of recent, attending high school and think that it is so lame because I feel
                 that I do not learn anything. If you think that you can help me with this issue
                 then you should give me a call.

                p.s. You would be a great kindagarden teacher.
