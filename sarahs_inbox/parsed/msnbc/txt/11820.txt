             MESSAGE:

             I am writing to request your endorsement of Mike Huckabee for president.



             He is a good man and has the most executive experience of any presidential candidate. His
             record in Arkansas as governor for 10.5 years shows a man committed to serving the people
             and putting their interests above his own political ambitions, making advances in
             conservation and infrastructue, keeping taxes low and balancing the budget, all while
             working with a 90% democrat legislature.



             He he has the goal of energy independence within 10 years and would work toward tapping
             our own sources of energy to free us from Saudi oil. This would include opening up ANWR
             as well as building new refineries among other things.



             Please support Mike Huckabee for president.
