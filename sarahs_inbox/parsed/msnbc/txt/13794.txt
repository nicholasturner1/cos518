             Yes- we have to find some exciting things for him to shadow tho... It's exciting now re:
             wrapping up session- don't know how exciting anything will be after April 13th though.

            Peter Maass , who interviewed you during NGA in D.C. has received a green light from his
            editors to continue with a feature story for the NY Times Magazine.

            With your approval on timing for early or mid-June, he is interested in an interview with
            you and doing some "shadowing" like Karen Breslau with Newsweek did.

            Right now, I can work with Janice on a preliminary time-frame if               you'd like to continue
            with this project.
