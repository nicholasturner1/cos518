  Sarah Palin advances to Round Two. Congressional Quarterly is undaunted by 2008's
  seemingly endless presidential campaign. Or at least, they're having fun with it. They've
  launched a game on their site to select running mates for both parties, called VP Madness.

 Right now it's McCain's turn to hear from the people; once the Dems sort themselves out, we'll
 get their version.
 And guess what, Sarah Palin - touted earlier as a potential McCain running mate -made it
 through Round One, walloping Texas Governor Rick Perry, 59-40.
 In Round Two, she faces off with Sam Brownbeck, the U.S. Senator from Kansas. Voters can
 play this round through May 12. We'll know what the people think after May 19.
