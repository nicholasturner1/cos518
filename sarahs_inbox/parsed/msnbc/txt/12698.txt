            Sarah,



            Kris P. might have told you that I had a meeting last

            week with Abbey Hensley, the exec. dir. of Best

           Beginnings.         She is the one that put together the

           Governor's Summit on Early Educ. Anyway, she is in

           Juneau today and will be dropping off a letter with

           professional recommendations that came out of the

            summit. She's very greatful to see most of their

           monies restored and appreciates your help in getting

           it.



           She would like to have a photo op with you so they can

           attach your picture to their brochures, etc. She

           understands you're crazy busy so she could do it at

           the end of the session but that's up to you. Her

           email is:     Privileged or Personal


           her cell is     Privil   d
