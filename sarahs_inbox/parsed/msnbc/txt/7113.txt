             We met this morning with Beth Stewart. In turn, she met yesterday with
             Congressional delegation staff and various people at the US Department of
             Commerce.

             She was told that the Congressional delegation is not opposing her
             nomination. Further, she had what amounted to an hour's interview with
             staff to the Under Secretary and felt that she was able to respond satisfactorily
             to their questions.

             We concluded that, between what she's done and what we've done, there's
             nothing more to do at this end for the moment. The next important juncture
             is the Governor's meeting with Bill Hogarth on May 28th.

             After the Governor's meeting, there may be some a itional things we can do
             to support Beth's nomination.

             Final decisions on council appointments are expected in mid to late June.

                 opposing the appointment of Beth Stewart and that they have so advised staff to
                 the Secretary of Commerce. Beth met today with the Secretary's staff, and the
                 clarification occurred soon there after.

                 I am copying the Governor so that she will know the latest developments in DC.
                 We are meeting with Beth Stewart tomorrow, and I will advise you of the results.

                 For whatever it's worth, Beth's DC counsel has heard the same information and
                 believes that confirmation of the Governor's original nominees is the best
                 approach, particularly given the president setting nature of this issue.
