          Nope . I wasn 't given any official word on this...            so I guess there' s no real "leak" on
          this specific matter.




          Ear still got it wrong making it sound like we're adding more staff to make up for the
          absence of the irreplaceable Bitney.

          Not sure if anyone else has replied to you yet on this. While i too am concerned about
          leaks and trust, this was one that became known on Friday. Chris was notified on Thursday
          and had an interview in Anchorage on Friday. They accepted and Mike announced the new
          structure at staff mtg on Friday. I apologize for the apparent disconnect in
          communication.

          Wonder how the Bitney replacement mention already got in the 'Ear.



          Sheeeesh - I can trust people in this business as far as I can throw them. Have the two
          even been officially offered, and accepted , the jobs yet?



          Reading the ' Ear today was another lesson for me that nothing is considered confidential
          to some folks , so fewer and fewer people should be brought in to "think out loud" re:
          admin business.
