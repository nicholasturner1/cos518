             MESSAGE:

            Dear Govenor Palin,

            Last year at the Juneau Health Fair , some nurses from Bartlett Beginnings at Bartlett
            Regional Hospital had a breastfeeding promotion table . We asked participants to share
            their thoughts about breastfeeding . You wrote , " I learned with 4 kids, the longer length
            of breastfeeding , the better . First baby 3 mon , Second baby 6 mon, 3rd baby 18 months, 4th
            baby 3 years."

            We are making a PowerPoint slide show of many of comments , and want to include yours. We
            would like to quote you . i.e. add your name to your quote. Can we do that ? Many other
            quotes were wonderful too, but of course coming from the govenor , yours would be very
            powerful , and a great role model . Please consider letting as add your name to the
            PowerPoint slide.

            The Health Fair is April 12, so your prompt reply would be helpful,                     as I am working on
            this now.

            Thank you for your great quote , and considering having us               " Use" your name.

            Congratulations on your upcoming birth as well.
