PIs get fresh fruit and veggies for our return on friday- Todd may contact you with anything else - but
our goal will be to have healthy foods there for the girls and as little processed foods as possible.
Thanks! Willow may FINALLY be getting happy about her return to DZ - Piper is totally excited to get
back there! So am I!



Do we have an account at El Sombrero's? May we?
