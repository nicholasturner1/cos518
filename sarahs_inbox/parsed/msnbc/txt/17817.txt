        Kari- would you let Gary know of the king air issue again yest - where it was last minute
        panic again to rearrange so I could make my obligation to the people in skagway who were
        waiting for me - and the plane's tire was discovered low at the very last minute -
        reminded me of the recent Nome trip where problems were not discovered until we were
        taxiing - and does anyone know if the king air will be here so I return on it or should I
        look for a commercial seat to get back to Juneau?



        It feels like there are forces constantly against us in trying to travel on the state,s
        plane :).  - just need to know if I should quit tentatively planning on using it or go
        straight to commercial air arrangements each time I travel.
