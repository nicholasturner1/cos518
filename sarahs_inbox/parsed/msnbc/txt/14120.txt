               A quick note. Had an e-mail updating ASTs efforts to promote better community relations in
               Aniak. Col. Audie Holloway forwarded an e-mail from Lt. Craig MacDonald in Bethel about a
               cross cultural communications training session held today. Two Aniak Traditional Council
               members attended and seemed pleased with the content.

               Sounds like some progress is being made - and that your troopers are trying hard to meet
               Aniak half way. Col. Holloway and I have talked about visiting Aniak sometime this spring to
               do a follow-up visit.

               Thanks.
