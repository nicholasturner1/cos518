              Sorry.  The original spill estimated at 100 gallons was in December but an update just
              came in at 3:00 today. it was the first I heard of the 4,284 gallons and the possible
              corrosion cause.

              I just received notice that there was a spill reported at 3:00 PM today at Kuparuk. The
              100 gallon of crude originally estimated was increased to 4,284 gallon (102 barrels).   The
              cause appears to be external corrosion related.     Cleanup is being hampered by 30 MPH
              winds and the spill area is covered with approx. 6 inches of snow .  More detail is listed
              below but I will pass along additional information once I get it.

              INCIDENT NAME :   Kuparuk 2U Pad Crude Oil Spill SITREP #: 7

              SPILL NUMBER : 07399935001 LEDGER CODE: 14247160

              TIME /DATE OF SPILL: ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. (CPAI) discovered the spill at 1:33 AM on
              December 16, 2007 and reported the spill to ADEC via the Alaska State Troopers at 2:43 AM.

              TIME/DATE OF SITUATION REPORT: 3:00 PM, January 2, 2008

             TIME /DATE.OF THE NEXT REPORT: When final spill volume is determined

             TYPE/AMOUNT OF PRODUCT SPILLED: CPAI initially reported that over 100 gallons of crude
             oil, gas and fluids spilled from a 24-inch flow line located within the Kuparuk River
             field between the 2V and 2W pads. The initial estimate of over 100 gallons was increased
             to 4,284 gallons (102 barrels) after further assessment of the spill area. The spill area
             is tundra covered with approximately six inches of snow.

             'LOCATION: Kuparuk River Field, flow line between 2U Pad and CPF-2. Latitude: N 70° 19'
             19.99"

             Longitude: W149° 55' 41.52".

             CAUSE OF SPILL: CPAI reported external corrosion to the flow line. After the insulation
             from the flow line was removed, responders observed a 6-inch long crack (about 1/8 inch
                                                              2

              wide at the center ) in the flow line . Investigators believe the cause was from external
              corrosion due to water trapped between the pipe and the insulation surrounding the flow
              line . Detailed investigation into the cause will be conducted.

              POTENTIAL RESPONSIBLE PARTY      ( PRP): ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc .     ( CPAI)

              RESPONSE ACTION : Weather is delaying cleanup operations today due to cold and 30 MPH
              winds.

              Thirty-four cleanup responders , split between two 12-hour shifts , supported by 20 Incident
              Command Team members are responding to the spill . On December 28th 2007, responders
              completed clean-up of wind-blown oil spray from the surrounding tundra and nearby frozen
              lake . The area has been sampled and the results are pending . Clean-up of the more heavily
              contaminated area near the point of release is continuing as weather allows. The majority
              of oil has been recovered . Responders are currently performing final cleanup with hand
              tools to remove a thin layer of oil that remains in this area . Contaminated snow is being
              processed in snow melters to separate waste types and determine oil volumes.

              Two ADEC spill responders are onsite monitoring the response and cleanup.

              SOURCE CONTROL : The source was controlled when operators shut down the oil wells feeding
              the flow lines.
