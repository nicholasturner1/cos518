                The House Oil and Gas Committee will be taking public testimony this evening at 5:30 pm.

                The Senate Resources Committee will be taking public testimony this evening at 6:15 pm.

                You can testify by going to your local Legislative Information Offices (LIO) and signing up to
                offer testimony on the House and Senate bills HB2001 and SB2001.
                You can find the location of all LIO's in the State , online at the State Legislature's web site
                http://w3. legis.state.ak.us/mise/lios.php

                A copy of both bills is available online at the State Legislature's web site.

                The Alaska State Chamber web site has a copy of a letter we sent to the Governor and talking
                points available for your use at http://www.alaskachamber.com/artman/publish/article 149.shtml

                The Alaska State Chamber of Commerce is urging the Governor and Legislature to proceed with
                caution as they begin their review and deliberations on the Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT) and the
                bill introduced by the Governor, Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share. The concern is that while
                the Legislature works to restore public faith, outcomes based more on emotion than economics
                will further chill the oil investment climate. A second concern is the stated goal of generating
                more revenue for the treasury. The chamber does not agree with that goal, and we fear that
                Alaskans will confuse the outcome of higher tax revenue with the goal of fair share.

                We believe the tax debate creates unwelcome risk and stalls investment planning and decisions.
                Taxes are a key consideration in all business investment decisions, so any time tax law is
                debated, investments can be delayed. The wrong tax rate can end all consideration of investment.

                generate more revenue at the current tax rate than would a dwindling quantity of oil at a higher tax rate.

                Given today' s oil prices, the Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share (ACES) legislation proposes to collect
                surplus revenue for a fiscal system that results in increased spending but lacks a strategic business plan
                for the state . This policy outcome does not warrant worsening the investment environment.

                The Alaska State Chamber strongly urges you to get out and offer your opinion on the proposed changes
                to the Petroleum Profits Tax. This is your chance to be heard on this important debate on the future of
                Alaska's economy.
