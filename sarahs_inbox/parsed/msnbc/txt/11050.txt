            Okay.... false alarm.... Sharon just verified.... our gasline folks are STILL on at 3pm. Not
            sure what Dan canceled at 3pm.



            Hope they don't hold back.




            Sharon,



            I may be mistaken , but did Dan just cancel your 3pm gasline experts?



            Our experts can make it known on other radio appearances, "It seems that other stations
            don't have the courage to hear what we're going to discuss today....Alaska's future. Kudos
            to you."
