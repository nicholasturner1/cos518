             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin- We hope you will consider running for Vice President. We first heard
             about you from a caller on Rush Limbaugh's Radio Show yesterday. You come highly
             recommended! We need your expertise and conservative views to give balance to the John
             McCain Ticket. We hope to hear more about you on the National level. Good luck in whatever
             you decide to do. Sincerely, Jerry & Janet Mull (R), Inglewood, CA
