           MESSAGE:

           Please consider being the V.P. on the Republican ticket.



           This morning Bill Cristel on Fox said you would be the best. I've heard you are a female
           Ronald Regan. You are also for driling for oil in your state.



           I'm excited about you and what you could do. I'll be looking forward to learning more
           about you.



           I know it would be difficult to move your family to D.C. but you would be doing a lot for
           your country.



           I hope you get lots more e-mails like this. I'm a super Republican who is not passionate
           about McCain but with you on the ticket I and others like me would be super energized.




           Thanks for your time and God's speed in whatever you do,

                                                                1
