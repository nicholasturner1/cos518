           Governor - I just received a phone call from Representative Bob Roses again today. Rep.
           Roses is inviting you and your family to his 61st Birthday/Campaign Kick-Off Barbecue. He
           states that it will not be a fund raiser. Just a community feast. He wants to post
           flyers this weekend and is proposing two dates in the event that you will be available and
           he can put your name on the posters.




           Thursday, 05.22 - 5:00 - 7:30 p.m. or Friday, 05.23 - 5:00 - 7:30 p.m.
