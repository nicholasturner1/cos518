               Thanks for the heads up Kim.

               I think we should sit down internally to discuss . Although pride of authorship isn't a concern of Governor Palin's,
               my fear is that Sen Wielechowski is getting out ahead on something that originated with Governor Palin and that
               DOF has already been working on.

               Hi Kim and Jerry,

               Attached is a revised draft of the bill that would mandate creation of an "online checkbook" for the
               state. I think the drafters made all the changes we discussed . Please let me know if you see any other
               problems. This bill is scheduled to be introduced in the first batch of prefiles. Please do not forward it
               to others at this time.

               Thanks,

               Michelle
