                 Alexander Creek is a Native group recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims
                 Settlement Act, with corporate status chartered under State law. So, the
                 corporation should have a president and board of directors. Joe or Frank may have
                 more information on the specific individuals involved and possible meetings. I just
                 didn't want you to be surprised by anyone at the AFN Convention.

                 Congressman Young may ask the Chairman of the House Resources Committee for
                 a hearing on four Alaska bills - an AFN rural development initiative, a new Native
                 veterans allotment bill, a Sealaska land exchange, and Alexander Creek. Only the
                 development initiative is likely to be non-controversial.

                 Neither Congressman Young nor his staff has asked for anything from the State as
                 yet. A staffer called on Friday to advise us of a possible hearing on November 14th.

                    Young's office hasn't told/ asked me anything about it - so I'm in the dark on any
                    details. In fact, I know about this issue via this email exchange, I haven't had
                    meetings on it.

                    Who would I even be meeting with? The community of Skwetna? Does Alexander
                    Creek have an organized government or Native Corp representing the area?

                     Subject: Alexander Creek Legislation - CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/ CLIENT
                     PRIVILEGE


                     It is our understanding that you may soon be meeting with representatives of
                     Alexander Creek. On Friday, we learned that there might be a House hearing on
                     November 14th on legislation proposed by Alexander Creek to grant them
                     additional lands in the Mat-Su Valley.
                  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                     With all of this in mind, and not knowing whether you ever saw my previous
                     email on the Alexander Creek bill, I have attached my earlier email analyzing this
                     legislation and suggesting how we might approach it, at least for the time being.
