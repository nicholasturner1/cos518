          Hi Joe: it will be interesting to hear your reaction to info being revealed by FBI in the
          Anderson case ... when we both get a second I'd love to hear it.



          I'm intersted in these prison folks who are being named - if they may have influenced DOC
          decisions in prior administation ( s) that you ' re left to contend with and clean up today.



         Have a great Sunday . Hope the budget cut issues don't spill over to you - if you hear from
         angry constituents re: their pet projects please send them my way . None of our cuts
         "kill" any project - other sources of funds exist and a better process to prioritizing
         projects MUST be adopted . Thanks!
