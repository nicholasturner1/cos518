               Dear Governor Palin,
                   The National Marine Fisheries has apparently just received a study which indicates the Cook Inlet belugas is
               probably threatened with extinction. It is likely they may announce a listing status under the Endangered Species
               Act soon as a result. Fish and Game asked for a six month extension, which would postpone such a
               determination. It is not clear that an extension would be granted. If they are listed as endangered it will impact all
               sorts of activities in Cook Inlet. This is not yet public information and if the extension is granted it will remain
               unknown for a while. Talis
