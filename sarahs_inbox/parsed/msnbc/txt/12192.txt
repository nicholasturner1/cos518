                   Subject: great press release!

                 I just read your press release re: gasline-it was fantastic ! I especially liked the last quote!!

                Have a good weekend ! I'm heading home to see the family, go to Tara's party, and MOST important get my hair
                cut!

                "Let's put this in perspective. We have relied on competition to advance the Alaska gasline project Competition is
                what AGIA is all about. We don't know whether the State is going to award an AGIA license over the next few
                months , but if ConocoPhillips is going to go out and spend tens of millions of dollars conducting field work, then I
                have to ask, 'What's the problem? ' Simply put, competition is working."
