              Governor -

              Your calendar and briefing papers for the 10 :00 a.m. meeting should be out for you at the Mansion . I wanted
              these to be there for you before tomorrow morning (Fri).

              I received a phone call from David Thompson ; he said that he knows you when you went to school together in
              Skagway. He is now living in Tacoma. This is Eugene Miller's Great Nephew . He would like a call from you.
              253-304-4367 (cell).
              Thanks, Janice

                 We came up with enough frozen bread, spaghetti fixings, brownies and punch just out of our pantry and
                 freezers . We have enough to feed the team without incurring any extra costs to the state. Diane (former fball
                 mom) and I are volunteering our time to put this together and are more then happy to do this for the boys. When I
                 extended the invite to the Colony coach it was for pizza, but I think they'll be happy with spaghetti!

                 The Juneau coach, Bill Chalmers is excited that the Governor invited the team over! Every Thursday night before
                 home games a parent opens up their home, and the 1st & 10 Club (3-4 parents) bring all the food- cook the
                 meal- and clean up. We just need to coordinate which Thursday night works best. I'll list the schedule below just
                 for reference.

                 Thank you!!
