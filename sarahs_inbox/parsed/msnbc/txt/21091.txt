          Yes the appointments are done but the presser was going Mon so we could send the cacfa
          names at the same time. My understanding was all appointees and unsuccessuls for D&A
          Council were notified yesterday by 3pm, apparently she was not reached. I'll call her
          now.



          I did not hear back from Mike on cacfa so we will send this presser out Monday regardless.
