Todd -



We received a request from the ANC Glacier Pilot's Military Appreciation Evening - Saturday, June
28, 2008 at 6:00 p.m. The Governor has seen the request - they have offered to fly her in via
helicopter just before the game and then throw first pitch!



With that being said they wanted to surprise her with having Track flown in to throw the first pitch as
its "Military Appreciation Evening." The Governor is not aware of this part of it if she regrets.



I know that she was going to regret attendance but I wanted to make sure you knew of the other part
of the invite. Of course I know Track probably would not want this so may I just regret. The
Governor will be attending William Sheffield's 80th b.day that is on Sat., June 28 from 1:00 - 5:00
p.m. Nizich will also be attending the birthday upon the Governor's request.



Your thoughts - Thanks, Janice
