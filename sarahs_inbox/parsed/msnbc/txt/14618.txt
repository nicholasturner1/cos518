             MESSAGE:

             Thanks for your strong witness for Pro-Life ....... may Trig do well to teach all of us of
             God's mysterious ways in His Creation. I've never been to Alaska ....... (and at my age,
             it perhaps seems unlikely that I ever will) ....... but there is a certain sense of peace
             to know that there are yet wild, undisturbed lands in Alaska ........ not all tore up by
             man's obscene greed for material gain. If you are supporting more resource development in
             the ANWR ...... please figure out some way for somebody to come back in another generation
             and not find the land all tore up. PLEASE!!!!
