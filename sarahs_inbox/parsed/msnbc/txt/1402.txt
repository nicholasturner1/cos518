Todd the AWIB meeting went very well everyone of the board members said it was the best board
meeting to date sorry you couldn't attend you would have enjoyed it very much. I hope to have our
pipeline tour schedule done today and forward you the travel. I stopped in to see Scott on Monday he
wasn't in but I talked to his wife I had her going for a minute have to tell you about it if you haven't
already heard. Will you be at the press conference? click
