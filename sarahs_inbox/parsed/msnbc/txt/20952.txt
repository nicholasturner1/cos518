         Governor Palin-rnrn I have never written a politician, let alone a governor , but right now
         I feel compelled to.rn I read your letter to Congressman Miller regarding his predator
         control comments . I truly appreciate your efforts , compassion and clarification of where
         we stand as Alaskans on this controversial issue , especially to &quot;outsiders &quot; who
         speculate / assume that they know whats best for our state . Thank you for having more
         &quot ; moxie&quot ; then any recent governor and be rest assured that you are favored by
         many because of it and are doing a great job. Thank you for not bowing to the advocacy
         groups with their pressures and special interests . We believe in you and we truly feel
         that you believe in all of us. rnrnSincerely , rnrnMerv Ehlers
