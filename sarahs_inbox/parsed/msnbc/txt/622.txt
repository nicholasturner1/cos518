 Variable Pay Plan (VPP) - 2003 Results

 I am pleased to report to you the 2003 VPP results for Alaska. The attached note and slide pack provide
 the details for our final score and payout, which will be administered in mid-March. Our 2003
 performance was excellent - thank you for your efforts. Most notably, we achieved an improvement in our
 safety performance with fewer recordables, Days Away from Work Cases, and vehicle accidents
 -compared to 2002. All areas of the business contributed to the delivery of our Plan targets through
 operating efficiency, reservoir management, wellwork and drilling results, and satellite field development.

 Our BU score of 140 points (base performance contract delivery = 100 points, stretch delivery = 150
 points) was awarded based on our fantastic results. Congratulations! The E&P Segment score was
 127.5, and these two scores provide the basis for determining the funding level and team payout for
 Alaska.

 Thank you again for your achievements in 2003 and for your continued focus on safety performance in
 2004.

 Steve

       2003 Business Performance and Variable Pay Plan - Update from
       Steve Marshall

       Alaska BU 2003 Results
       I am pleased to be able to report to you the final 2003 results from our Alaska business
       and their impact on the Variable Pay Plan. Firstly, thank you for your hard work and
       dedication to excellence in 2003. Your efforts helped us achieve strong performance
       results in all areas against Plan - a performance viewed as one of the strongest in the
       E&P Segment . Our six key results are summarized below:

       Safety performance is our top priority, and I am very pleased with the progress we have
       made. Our Recordable Injury Frequency (RIF) rate recordable injury frequency
       improved 40% relative to 2002 (77 vs. 140 injuries), and our Days Away from Work
       Case (DAFWC) frequency rate improved 29% (8 vs. 12). This means 67 fewer people
       were injured working in our operations. We also beat our targets for number and
       frequency of vehicle accidents, and we reduced our High Potential/Major Incidents by
       55% relative to 2002, from 11 to 5. Safety Inputs (ASA's, Safety Observations, Training
       and Action Item Closure) for Alaska are Best-in-Class for the E&P Segment worldwide!
       Over 75,000 observations were conducted in 2003, and high quality safety inputs by you
       and our contractors will help us move closer to the Incident Free Culture that we all
       desire. Thank you for your continued focus on creating a safe workplace environment.
       We need to maintain this progress through 2004.

       The safety immersion program which began in 3Q 2003 with Lifting Operations is
       continuing in 1Q 2004 with Driving, followed by Energy Isolation later in the year.
       These three activities are the most frequent cause of injuries and fatalities in BP
       operations worldwide. Continued high levels of safety observations, whether through the
       behavioral programs on the Slope or the new STOP program in Anchorage, will help us
       further improve our safety performance in 2004 and close the gap between Alaska and
       the rest of BP Group.

      Production in 2003 exceeded Plan across the North Slope. We finished the year 6
      mboed above Plan, after adjusting for the increased Northstar royalty payments due to
      high oil price (-3.9 mbd). Northstar royalty payments will not impact VPP payout.
      Congratulations and thanks to all who contributed to this excellent result! The
      production delivery would not have been possible without safe execution of maintenance




                                                                                       ROSTON 00789

       and construction activities, new well and wellwork planning, and excellent teamwork. A
       few highlights:
       · Drilling performance across the Alaska BU is recognized by both the worldwide
          drilling community and senior management as a model for delivery across BP.
          Drilling efficiency and new well delivery exceeded our Plan target.
       · Wellwork delivery and wellwork efficiency also exceeded Plan, including the
          delivery of excellent results from the $10m of additional funding received from the
          Segment Executive Team (SET) in 2Q.
       · Northstar operating efficiency improved from 75% in 2002 to 86.5% in 2003. Base
          reservoir performance as well as strong new well performance will contribute to
          extending the plateau production for this field.

       Cost performance in 2003 continued to support the efforts being made toward delivering
       a long-term competitive business in Alaska. Office overhead costs, field contractor costs,
       and Alyeska's costs all showed improvements over 2002.

       Capital expenditure was $140m below Plan, due to a combination of savings and
       deferrals. Over a third of the $651 in spend was for the new tankers, the first of which is
       scheduled to be delivered in 2004. Drilling spend was also about a third of the capital
       spend, and our drilling program also delivered significant savings. This lower cost for
       developing new barrels is key to keeping our business competitive.



       Overall Scorecard and Performance Score
       At the end of each quarter in 2003, the SET reviewed our BU performance against our in-
       year and long-term Plan targets for purposes of our Variable Pay Plan (VPP). As a
       reminder, a score of 100 represents Plan delivery, and a score of 150 represents delivery
       of stretch targets. The Alaska BU received a final 2003 score 140, compared to 140 in
       3Q, 125 in 2Q, and 115 in 1Q. There were no E&P businesses with a higher result. This
       is a superb outcome, of which we should all be proud.

      The second component of VPP is the score for the E&P Segment worldwide. Based on
      year-end results, the E&P Segment scored 127.5. This means that the Alaska VPP is
      funded at 135.8 points (results weighted 2/3 BU and 1/3 Segment). As a reminder, each
      individual's target bonus opportunity (TBO) has both a team and individual component,
      with the exception of hourly individuals who are 100% team based. The TBO depends
      upon individual level, and the following table summarizes the funding and team element
      payout (2/3 of funding) which these excellent results will generate. Individual amounts
      will be determined by Team Leaders based on performance.

      Once again, I want to thank you for your hard work and support in delivering these very
      strong results. Every part of the business has contributed to 2003 success and deserves
      credit for an outstanding year. Safety remains our biggest challenge as we work toward
      achieving our goal of an Incident Free Culture. This past year we demonstrated our
      capability to deliver great improvements in safety. I ask for your support in continuing
      that performance in 2004.

Russia, a country which is the world's most significant hydrocarbon producer both today
and for tomorrow.

-We more than replaced our production with new proven reserves at an organic rate of
122% This was the 11th year in a row in which we more than replaced our production,
giving us the material for future growth.

·We participated in discoveries in: Egypt (Saqqara), Angola (in Blocks 15 and 31) and the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico (Tubular Bells, Puma).

-All projects in our new E&P profit centers are on track. For example, production has
started in Angola at Jasmim and Xikomba; in Trinidad at Atlantic LNG Train 3; and in the
Gulf of Mexico at Nakika.

-Full year production, at over 3.6mmb/d, was in line with the capacity indicator range we
gave a year ago.

Funding basis = 2/3 (BU score) + 1/3 (E&P Segment score) = 2/3*(140) + 1/3*(127.5) = 135.8
Funding % range was set by BP Group at beginning of 2003 as a straight line between a score of 75 and
150. Funding % for each Grade is determined by intersection of our 135.8 score and the funding % range.
Team Element = 2/3*(Funding %). See previous slide for the breakout by Grade.
Individual Element will vary by individual as determined by your performance assessment/team leader, with
the exception of hourly staff, whose payout is 100% team-based.
