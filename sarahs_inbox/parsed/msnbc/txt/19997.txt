           I'm with Kris on this. Sheila Balastrairi (sp) said this morning that

           the Governor has NOT endorsed a candidate for senate.

          Even that said, not a big deal unless I'm missing something. It isn't

          specific to one candidate. Just my opinion, but I don't think additional

          follow-up is necessary.

            I hear ya. Here ' s Megan's exact quote from last night:



            .On July 2nd Palin and Stevens appeared at a press conference about

            energy.   Back them she said endorsement of a Senate candidate would come

            at a later date."



            I'll see if I can track down the July 2nd stuff.

           I was there as was Sharon and Nizich . I recall the "now is not the time

           or place. " And no specific mention that an endorsement would be

           forthcoming.

          Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment . I'll ask

          Sharon to check on what Balding think she heard - pls give Sharon details

          so she can check. I said weeks ago " this isn't the time " in a Federal

          Bldg to endorse a candidate . Those who were with me at the event heard

          it. Can't remember who was with me.

          don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard

          baldino quote you from ted ' s energy press conference where you said an

          endorsement would be forth coming .   don't know how you navigate this,

          but the press will pick up on it and try to further shove a wedge

          between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
