           Subject:                 Telephone Call - Fri., 07.18.08


           Governor - Bill Clarke from Chugiak (Craig Williams's father) called and wanted to speak
           with you directly and "Thank you" for what you have done for Craig. He explained that
           this would only take 60 minutes and that he owed this to his son. I explained that due to
           your schedule I could not promise a return call but that I would make sure you knew of his
           call and his thanks. Thanks, Janice
