Ivy- Amen! Aside from the gift of our Governor, the best, the gift of friendship has been such a
blessing. Thank you. What a successful year!

Tara and just went and grabbed some dinner before she went to the airport. We both toasted to your
success! We got to talking about the last year and are just both amazed at your accomplishments,
leadership, and how you've brought so many of us together. I mean, tara will be a lifelong friend I'm
bonded to b/c of your campaign. Same w kris and frank, your girls and parents. Anyway, we're very
proud of all you've done this last year-beating 2 governors, ethics reform, agia, aces-just to name a
few! This is a very important/historic/monumental time in

Alaska and I'm proud to be a small part of it b/c of you. I remember my first fundraiser of yours-nov
2005 at joanne and dorwin's place on the hwy and still can't wrap my mind around how all of our lives
have changed since then. I know you're modest and way too humble to agree with me, but it's the
truth!

Have a safe trip home. Tell my favorite girls I say hi. And, take some time to enjoy this! As always-
you're awesome.

Ivy
