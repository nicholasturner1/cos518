           Governor Palin,



          If you actually get a chance to personally read this, let me say that no matter what
          happens in the upcoming election, we are all proud of you. I wish you luck.



          I never thought that a person who was an intern for me and others at KTUU would become
          governor, much less a candidate for Vice President of the United States! Just goes to show
          you what opening the doors on the third floor can lead to.



          By the way, you don't mind if I keep telling people you were my intern, do you? I might
          just put that on my resume.



          Best of Luck and God. Bless,



          Richard
