            Dear Governor Palin:




            I just wanted to know that you had - and have - my full support despite all of the
            scurrilous accusations levelled against you.  You are a shining example of what America's
            leaders should be like.  Keep fighting the good fight, and.., what the hey -




           MCCAIN/PALIN '08!!!




           'Cordially,



           Damian Geminder
