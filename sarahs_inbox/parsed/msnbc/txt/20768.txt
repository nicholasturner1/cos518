           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governer . Palin,




           I have a long time friend, John Douglas Jones, who we have applied for a

           disability waiver through Alaska fish and game department . Mr. Jones has

           neurophty which is a degenerative nerve disease.




           He is on limited income, disability SSI, I understand that your office

          has fifty hunting license waivers at your disposal annually and many go

          unused each year.




          I am requesting that your office grant him a waiver for the hunting trip

          of his lifetime , PLEASE?




          Myself and Greg Morgan will assist our friend in his two week trip to

          enjoy the beauty of Alaska . Greg and I spend two or three weeks in
                                                              2




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01 0023831

          Alaska every year.




          We spent thousands of dollars each year supporting fish and game, local

          economy and will continue but this would be a great blessing to Doug's

          family in lower expenses as well.




          Please let one of your staff know of your decision as we plan on

          traveling to Alaska on September 7, 2008.
