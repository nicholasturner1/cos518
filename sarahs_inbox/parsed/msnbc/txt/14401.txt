             MESSAGE:

             Just today, I read about the birth of your son. God bless you and your family on the
             ocassion of this blessed event. My youngest brother, #6 in our family, was born with Downs
             Syndrome. He also suffered from a heart defect and died at 9 mos. Thank you for loving
             what God has given to your family. My brother lives in every home that accepts with love a
             child of God with Downs syndrome.

             God bless
