              MESSAGE:

              May I respectfully ask that you give great consideration to endorsing Gov. Mike Huckabee
              for the Republican nominee for President.



              After 10 1 / 2 years as Governor of Arkansas , Gov. Huckabee has a proven record or working
              hard for his people . He lowered taxes , rebuilt the state's infrastructure , tackled
              education and moved Arkansas from 49th lowest performance in the nation to 9th in the
              nation . He has bold new ideas , and contageous hope for the future of this country. I
              believe he has the core beliefs to lead the way on getting a handle on health care costs,
              sealing our borders and working for a common sense solution to the millions of illegals in
              this country.



             Your time is valuable. I thank you for it, and I thank you for considering an endorsement
             for Gov . Mike Huckabee . I sincerely believe he is the only person who can hold the white
             house for the Republicans and maybe restore the Republican majorities in the House and
             Senate.



             Respectfully
