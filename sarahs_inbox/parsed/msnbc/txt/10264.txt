             Hi Sarah,




             The staff at WHS will be having a breakfast on Friday Dec 21, at 8:00 in the morning. We
             will also be celebrating Mr. P. 50th birthday. We would like to invite you if you are in
             Wasilla to stop by and have breakfast with all of us. We are going to send him down to
             Missouri to see his friend Mike Luthes, I believe he was a science teacher here when you
             went to school. Thanks for all you do for out state. Happy Holidays! Miss'Anne,
