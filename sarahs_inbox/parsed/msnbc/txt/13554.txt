             Very hurtful that someone would try to put that wedge between an ill legislator and any of
             us. Deceitful.

             We also had that nice billing signing ceremony in Foster' s office.

             And Todd personally called Foster in the hospital and he wept on the phone because he was
             so appreciative.  Doubt they passed on that piece of info.



             gov.sarah@yahoo.com wrote: Absolutely false. This sounds like another Bitney deal - he's
             good friends with Foster, he's helping Foster... But I've never heard of any request at
             all like this except would I donate a "lunch with the Governor" for a Foster fundraiser
             and of course I said I sure would!



            Erika, Mike, anyone else: any info on this?



            Maybe soon Shelia will connect dots and understand that people do tell her lies just to
            rile us up and/or make us look horrible.

             Governor - I just got this:



             I'm getting a whole bunch of messages that the House asked the governor to host a
             fundraiser for Richard Foster , or let them use the mansion or something and she refused.
             Good reason?
