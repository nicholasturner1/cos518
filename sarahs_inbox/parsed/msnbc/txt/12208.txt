             Although we didn't yet set an interview time, NY Times Magazine still interested in
             developing a story, even if it doesn't happen on this trip.



             Their process is similar to 60 Minutes - visit then consider moving forward. It wouldn't
             be a single interview and may take a little time to develop.
