          Message:The current State Capital Budget includes funds to replace the dilapidated first
          aid facility at Hilltop - the structure was was originally built in 1983 as a temporary
          solution.

          The service Hilltop provides to our community is immesurable - to see so many young people
          enjoying our long winter season with healthful outdoor activities in a safe environment is
          a joy.



          Thank you for considering upgrading the first aid facility at Hilltop -
