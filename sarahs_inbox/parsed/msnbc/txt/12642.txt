           Honorable Governor Palin,



           Would you consider running with John McCain as Vice - President . I feel that having you on
           the ticket would be a tremendous asset to the Republician Party , and might be the only
           possible way to defeat the Democrats . I know that there is considerable talk in my area
           about a McCain Palin ticket.




           Very Best Regards,



           TSGT ( USAF ) John S. Mote
