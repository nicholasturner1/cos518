             Palin addresses farmers protesting dairy closing

             WASILLA - Gov . Sarah Palin told a crowd of farmers and concerned Valley residents today that
             she plans to fix the broken state-run Matanuska Maid dairy.

             "Things are kind of a mess right now with what's happening with Mat Maid, and we're
             going to clean it up," Palin said. "We can revitalize it, and that's what our commitment
                   ,,
             is.

             Palin addressed approximately 100 people gathered at 10 a.m. at a farm near the Trunk
             and Bogard roads intersection.

             Bob Havemeister, a lifelong Valley farmer in whose driveway the group assembled, said
             the dairy buys the bulk of his milk. If it closes as planned July 7, he'll have to send his
             cows to slaughter. Asked what will happen to his dairy farm, he said, "It might turn into a
             subdivision. What else would I do?"

             Dairy officials said previously that should the dairy remain open, it would lose $2 million
             by the end of the year. Since 2005, it has lost $1.3 million, including $700,000 this year,
             according to statistics cited previously by state creamery board chairman Mac Carter.

             The board, citing mounting debts, on Wednesday rejected Palin's call to reconsider its
             close date.
