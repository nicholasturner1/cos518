           Governor-



           Pat wanted to know if you could give him a call regarding Jim Clark. I did not promise
           anything saying you were traveling but I did tell him I would try. He is at 586-4816



           Clark' s included you in his apology today-



           "I specifically apologize to then candidates for governor in the 2006 Republican primary,
           John Binkley and Sarah Palin. Nothing can justify breaking Alaska's campaign finance laws
           to unfairly benefit one candidate. Such actions hit at the heart of our democratic system
           by making the public cynical about government.

           "I apologize, too, to Governor Frank Murkowski who trusted me to follow the law while
           acting in his behalf. I recognize that some people will unfairly attribute what I have
           done to him."
