            Frank already found out the fishing bill- I'll have him contact you and Rosanne can help
            organize for it.

             Can he come in today for bill signing instead of tomorrow? There's no ceremony anyway and
            he could squeeze iit in between my interviews. It's easier than tomorrow's busy day.

             Not your fault be it was confirmed for the event organizer that someone from the Gov's
            office would be there (as evidenced by their printed program announcing Gov's Proclamation
            following Pres Proclamation ), if not me then someone else ... so if I had not been able to
            attend surely someone on staff (Mark, Colleen, Rosanne, Jerry, McHugh, etc) was planning
            on being there - and someone would have the proclamation in hand. I was worried that
            something happened to Jerry (or McHugh) on the way out, as he was on board to do the
            Valley event, per Kris and Janice's email from that morning.



             We can make sure event organizers have in their possession a copy of proc ' s in the future
            - I noticed her binder had not only her talking points but all items others were planning
            to present.




            Also, with that event, I could have done both the Anchorage and Valley events afterall,
           as Stevens attended both and wasn't late for ours... I had been under the impression we
           couldn't do the big Anchorage event be a choice had to be made due to their overlapping.
           Hopefully we can sched better these external events that mean a lot to folks so I can do
           as much as possible for them. Thanks

             Governor:



             I will check with Kelly on a bill signing event for the hunting / fishing licenses.



             On the proclamation, I have to take full responsibility. I should have had Abby print
            out the proclamation and get a copy on your desk. I also thought Mr. Beale would attend
            with the proclamation. In the future, I will have proclamations printed out and forwarded
            to Kris to hold.

             What event is being planned for recognizing our uniformed Alaskans who'll now receive the
            hunting/fishing licenses that we worked on this session? These troops are worthy of a good
            event to announce the benefit they can receive.



             Pls let me know when and where we'll do this before their fishing season really kicks
            off. Thanks



             Also- Randy- any word on what happened yesterday with the missing proclamation at the Mem
            Day ceremony?
