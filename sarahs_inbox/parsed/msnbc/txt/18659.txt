           We had heard such tough things about struggles faced in the Copper Center community from
           troopers in Glenallen and OCS there. I had asked the OCS personnel if there wasn't a point
           of light or hope in Copper . She named the principal in the Copper Center School.



           We stopped by and got to talk with the teachers and uplift them ... they were in tears,
           joyful that we were there to say thank you.



           As I walked out, a young teacher of two years stopped and asked that I pass a message to
           you. She said to say thank you for the money you provided. She said her position was
           slated for elimination and you had a hand in making sure they got adequate funding. She
           teared up as she told me and she was extremely grateful . Thought you ' d like an encouraging
           heads up today!
