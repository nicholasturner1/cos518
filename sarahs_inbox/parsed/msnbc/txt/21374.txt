             Well that's the diplomatic way to say it. I got to hand it to pat though, he's handling it
             well. Jay didn't do himself any favors-he made himself look like a jerk (by the way
             "jerk" is not what I was yelling at my tv). During the at ease it looked like lyda went up
             to pat and apologized for ramras. I hope that was the case although I some how doubt it.

             I'll bring my trough of make - up in case I end up spending the night in Ketch!



             Can Jay be any more of a disrespectful yahoo in his questioning of Pat today?

              You're handling it very graciously- if I was pat I would have jumped over the table and
              strangled him. Who does jay think he is? !? He needs to shut his mouth, set his ego aside,
              and try and learn something . And another thing, if he' s so upset about being in jnu during
              his "offseason " he shouldn't be a legislator!

               Pat,

              Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
                                                                        2
