              Dear Gov. Patin--

              Just a brief note to let you know how proud we are of you and your quest to bring reform to
              Washington, DC.

              This year, were hosting a young woman from Indonesia as an exchange student. I asked her last night if
              she would like to go see you at the rally this AM. She said " Sure"!

               So, we got up early and got a good spot for your rally this morning.

              Again, were very proud of you and were confident that you're taking the "Alaska Spirit" with you on
              the campaign trail:

              If you have an opportunity, I hope you can send a note of encouragement to Sulis. Her full name
              is Sulistianingsih Fitri .


              Her email address is: shuliez-whitel7@yahoo.com


              She is a senior at Service H.S. in Anchorage and she's studying the American political system on a
              scholarship from the U.S. State Department. I took her to the voting station with me for the primary on
              Aug. 26.



              Best, s

              Scott McMurren
