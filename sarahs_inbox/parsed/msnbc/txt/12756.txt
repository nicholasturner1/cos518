            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the upcoming birth of your new baby! I have been inspired by your
            story and seeing all that you are doing as a Mom and a governor. It would have been great
            to see you as a Vice President contender for Senator McCain but you're doing a great job
            there!  The Republican Party could use a lot more like you.
