          Dear Governor Palin:                                                                   June 13,
          2008




          Thank you for your email. When we wrote the "Alaska? or Canada?" ad, we listed those
          known for their support of a Canadian gasline.




          By including " The Corrupt Bastards Club" ( whose members do in fact back a Canadian line)
          that list implied that others were corrupt. This was not intended .    The ad has been
          corrected ( see attached ) and an apology sent to Marty and her team.




          We remember well your Inaugural Address when you called on the people to hold you
          accountable . We believe that the legislature should be held to that same standard.




          We strongly stand by the message of this ad in its final form. It would be a grave
          mistake to give a foreign country, however friendly, the power to decide when, if ever, a
          pipeline is built and who will enjoy the "maximum benefit" of this resource owned by all
          Alaskans.




          Sincerely,




          Malcolm Roberts, coordinator, Backbone III
