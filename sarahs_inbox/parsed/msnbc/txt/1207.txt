Dear Governor Palin;



Congrat's on the birth of Trig. As the father on a wonderful 7 year old son who happens to have
Down syndrome I know that whatever special needs your son has he will amaze you every single
day. Live life with passion and don 't let anyone steal one single portion of your dreams.



Congratulations again and enjoy your new baby boy!



Jeff Huffman, father to Nash.




                                                  1                              ROSTON 02168
