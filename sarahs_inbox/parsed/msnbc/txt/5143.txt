                 Subject: Briefing Paper for Jim Mulva
                 Governor:

                 Attached is the briefing paper for tomorrow 's meeting with Jim Mulva and Jim Bowles . It went over one
                 page, but considering the significance of their company 's activities in our state , I thought it would be OK.
