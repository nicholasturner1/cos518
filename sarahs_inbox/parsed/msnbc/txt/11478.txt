                 Subject: Update from Ketchikan

               Governor:

               Southeast Region Director Menzies returned from a trip to Ketchikan where he was discussing projects with the
               Assembly and City Council at a joint meeting . He wanted me to let you know that several Assembly members
               and City Council members approached him after the meeting and asked him to pass on their apology to you for
               the way Mayor Williams is behaving, and that they do not approve of it. (The strong pro -bridge group there truly
               does not represent the whole community , but they are very vocal)

               Randy
               P.S.

               As to Mayor Homaday, he did later acknowledge that at the AML meeting, Mayor Williams was chairing the AML
               committee and just as Rep. Johansen did the day before, refused to allow technical staff to provide details.
