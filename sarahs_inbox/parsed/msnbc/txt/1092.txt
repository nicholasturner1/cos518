          I am pleased to provide a letter of recommendation for Grant Niver, an outstanding citizen of
Alaska.



         I have known Grant and his family for many years. Grant is organized, efficient, extremely
competent, and has an excellent rapport with people of all ages. His communication skills, both
written and verbal, are excellent.



        It has been my pleasure to watch Grant grow to be the remarkable young man he is. Without
a doubt he will be successful in all his future endeavors. As Alaska's Governor I am proud to
recommend Grant Niver to you.

Janice, I added the first paragraph. Hopefully he is an outstanding citizen? If we had a little more
info, such as academics, sports, volunteer work, etc. it would be helpful.
