  Todd,

  Would you like to give the 1st Ladies a gift? This expense is fine, as it's a proper protocol gift. Here are a
  couple of ideas.

  --At the lunch we could give everyone a House zipper pull and pin, they could be nicely wrapped and at
  each place setting...

  --At the reception you could give each of the 1st Ladies a nicely framed picture of the House when you
  introduce them....
    You could give a House zipper pull and pin to each of the Capital City Celebration members, I think
  there's about 8 of them.

  Thanks,
  Erika
