  I should probably leave you alone, but its killing me...

  She got the tax... the "experienced" guys didn't

  And, shes got them scrambling all over themselves trying to be first with the gas line and add to the
  economy

  I'd love to see Obama arguing with Mulva or Malone!

  And all this on the eve of yet another hurricane in the gulf!
