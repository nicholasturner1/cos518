                 Subject: Administration logs/protocol

               Wyatt was just in here helping me change passwords and commented on the new policy about
               logging personal cell phone calls. He said he plans to turn in his Blackberry because he
               doesn't want to deal with the paperwork hassle of logging personal calls. He also made a good
               point of asking rhetorically what is our chargeback rate to the state when we use our personal
               resources for state business. Our own personal phones, computers, vehicles, etc.

               As you probably know, part of his job i volves roaming office to office to help with computer
               issues and not having him available b phone will cause delay in getting computers fixed.
               Maybe we should have an actual lawyer in Law look at what the IRS has actually said if Admin
               can't craft a reasonable policy that includes not having to log incidental use.
