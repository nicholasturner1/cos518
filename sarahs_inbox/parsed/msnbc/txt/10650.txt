              MESSAGE:

              Governor Palin,




                I am temporarily residing in SC, but as an Alaskan, I want you know that your efforts
             as Governor are making us very proud to be Alaskans. Please continue your hard work, to
             put the people first, as our founders intended, and never allow big business or the
             establishment to dictate policy.

             Thank you, and God Bless.

             Micah Lee
