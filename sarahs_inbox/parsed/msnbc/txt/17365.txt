           Hi Governor. They have scheduled the funeral for Staff Sergeant Brevard for Wed. 3/28 at 1:00pm. He was a
           Dimond High graduate . You are scheduled to be in Juneau in that morning , Alyeska meeting set for 10 :00am and
           Pioneer set for 11:00am; then you travel Jno/Anch at 1:40pm. Do you want to change this schedule to attend the
           funeral? Lt. Gov. doesn't get back from his trip until night of 3/28. Sorry.
