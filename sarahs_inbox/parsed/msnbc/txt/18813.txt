         Dana Fabe called me two days ago to ask if I would chair the crim justice working group.
         Talis' concern had been that the chief j had designated Stephanie Cole to serve in her
         stead, so Talis designated Rick Svobodny. Talis also had said he would serve if the Chief
         would actually serve--we didn't like that it felt like exec branch officials would be
         reporting to the Chief Justice.




         Dana was mortified when I told her that's how we had perceived or heard the invite as it
         originally came to Talis. I asked Dana if she would personally serve and she agreed to.
         She still wants me to chair or cochair it (which I can do).




        I still have to talk with Walt. I am not as concerned anymore about the possibility of
        this driving your agenda. it will be a lower key informally mtg group with no formal votes
        or reports. Just a chance for people across the justice system to meet together about four
        times yearly. I spoke with Talis about it yesterday. Seems ok with serving on the
        committee.




        Also, I filled in Randy Ruaro yesterday on what I've gathered and heard and plugged him
        into the working group notification cycle so he can be at any meetings. I will likely go
        ahead and try to chair or co chair the group. (After I talk with Walt.)



        In Galena today. Back around 4:30.
