               We WILL hear from All Ak Gasline supporters, agpa and angda... We are NOT going to "pull a
               Murkowski" and refuse to let others talk about their gasline ideas... even including
               supporting legislative hearings on all the ideas - this "gasline team is refusing..." is
               getting out of hand - we are listening, we will listen... and those applications will
               speak for themselves at the end of the day. We need to fix the misperception that's out
               there.
