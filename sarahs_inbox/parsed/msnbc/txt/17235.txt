             Subject: Cary Carrigan on Monday
             Just an FYI , Carrigan teased your presence on his show Monday morning and said that you
             all would get to the bottom of Tillerson's comments.

             My understanding is that Tillerson has another presentation tomorrow before the Council on
             Foreign Relations and so there may be more to report.

             On his show today , Cary did nothing but reemphasize how little Exxon wants to be a part of
             this state and It 's now only coming out with these statements because the Governor's
             asking people to step forward or stop playing . Cary was all about the facts - went on
             Exxon's website where it shows it's not even going to look to Alaska for natural gas until at
             least 2010 and beyond. All good messages / all factual information . He had Scott Heyworth
             and Harold Heinze as guests . All the callers were favorable, etc.

             Thanks,
             Meg
