MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful new son Trig! I am sure he is beautiful! As the mother
of a lovely, 20 year old young lady who has "special challenges" know that she has had a wonderful
life, and is a contributing member of her community. She looks forward to getting a job in the next
year and then getting her own apartment. Yes, their are challenges, but the joy far outweighs them.
I look forward to hearing about little Trig's wonderful life.



Blessings to you and your family,

Cathy Murahashi
