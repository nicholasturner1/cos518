         Thanks- mike and others can cc me in and/or come directly with me on their edits so we're
         not bugging you... and Joe has a similar suggestion to mike's re: priy6lecled Or _P so if all
         are cc'd in we can knock out the edits asap and get this over with. I'll make that change
         to the copy.

        Mike's comments.       I believe Bruce is calling Pat to get numbers. I'll follow-up to make
        sure.
