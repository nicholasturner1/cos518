            Congratulations Governor Palin and family on the birth of Trig. I enjoyed reading your
            statement to the press on the Alaska home page. Your response blessed me. You are a
            dynamic and very special woman and Governor. I am so pleased to say I work with and for
            you.  God bless you.
