           Fleener ( Feener? ) Sounds good to go - sounds like Frank vetted his name with many. Mike -
           after our discussion yest did you notify other leggies besides the one Frank did?

           If not, don't want them to be surprised by presser today announcing him, but don't want
           push back from any who'd place any race card either.



           Sharon - his name is ready to be released, it should be an easy presser with attachment of
           this seven- page resume (which is very impressive) and a couple of quotes from Frank.
           Releasing it today gets that off my plate. Thank you.
