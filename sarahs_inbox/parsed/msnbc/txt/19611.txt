           Mrs. Palin,




                 I have emailed you several times in the past to say, I think you are doing an
           outstanding job. I have emailed Mr. Halcro several times in the past 2 years that you have
           been in office, to ask him to "grow up", among other things. His latest stunt with
           accusations of improper actions on your part concerning Walt Monegon and Trooper Whooten
           are ludicrious. So, being the good constituient that I am, I reminded him of the fact that
           they all serve at your "pleasure". I also reminded him that he "lost" the election, he is
           not the Governer, and that he could now go away somewhere and stir that kind of stuff
           elsewhere. Seriously, not everyone is smoking what he's rolling, and there are tons of
           folks out here that stand behind you 100%. Keep up the good work, and oh by the way, I
           work for BP on NorthStar Island, stop by for lunch some time when I'm here, I'd really
           like to meet you and talk polotics.
