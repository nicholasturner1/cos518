Governor,



The event is definitely a family event. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students project and the Boys and
Girls Club are partnering with community agencies to put together this year's Family Day Celebration.
Last year's event had over 300 attendees. There are many family activities and the invitation letter
specifically invited you and your family. They are also requesting you prepare a proclamation
designating the 3rd Saturday of June as Alaska Family Day Celebration. Any chance Willow would
read the proclamation?



Mike

Hi kris- do you remember if its a kid-friendly event? Was the family invited? If so, could still go if Pip
and Willow travel, if not then no b/c I'm not leaving them with sitters for that long (on top of not having
see Willow since May 22)

Governor,



Now that the cabinet meeting is Friday, is Ketchikan still a go for Saturday?
