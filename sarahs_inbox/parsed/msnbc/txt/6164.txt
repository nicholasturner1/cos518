         Sounds good. Pls wk with Tibs on this. Also to be included should be help provided in the
         Bethel region via more public safety and judicial officers. I am asking Talis to give you
         an update on the very disturbing environment in the region, and his suggestions for help
         we can provide. (He just returned from visiting his Bethel offices)

         Re my helping with legislature/legislation for the interim: Are you interested in me
         working with DPS, DOL, Corrections, Court System in coming up with ideas for you related
         to an anti-crime package you can introduce next session? (I can coordinate with Mike T.-
         just wanted to ask if you're interested in me doing this as I'm interested in working on
         it)
