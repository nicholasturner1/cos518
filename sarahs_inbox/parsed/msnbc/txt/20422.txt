              To: Gov: Atty. Gen., Legislature and all energy task forces and committees

              Ref      Utube Video        Plug-in: What is role for Washington?
                                        June - 2008 ( look at # of viewers)
                                        Sponsored by Google and the Brookings Institute
                                        Several Different Panels

              Ladies and Gentlemen,

                  You might want to watch this 2 or 3 day event on Utube. There are some notable presenters,
              commentaries, and panel discussions...
                   This is kind of a quick learn up on main stream thoughts about the new Transportaion
              systems emerging for the home and businesses.

              I dont agree with several comments, perspectives, and attitudes;
                 But considering the weight of authorative bodies, industries represented, and passionately
              diverse panel discussions here; I find it to be a great learning tool regardless of which side your
              on..

              There aint nothin like a fearless, good, lively, honest, passionate, and well intended public
              discussion of opinions and ideas



               Thank You Sincerely,

              Paul D. Kendall

              907-884-2424

              PS.. Why cant our various elected and appointed leaders, energy task forces, committees, and
              other energy related bodies have their meetings on camera like this so we can see what our
              learders are thinking;
               and maybe we can participate, also?
