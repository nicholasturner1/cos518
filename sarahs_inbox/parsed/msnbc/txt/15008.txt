            Governor:




            Leo should have a status report to us very soon. Until the litigation is cleared up in
            federal court, it seems like the only work that should be occurring would be related to
            getting us accurate and updated cost estimates, etc.

            Randy,




            Good afternoon. The commissioner is in the final stages of preparing a status report for
            the governor on this subject. Leo said he would CC you on the email to her.
