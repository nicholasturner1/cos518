             MESSAGE:

             We have a small class of graduating Seniors on May 17th at 3 pm and their speaker is not
             able to make their commencement. She is a past teacher that can not make it for personal
             reasons.   The class was brainstorming and your name, Mrs. Patin, came up over and over
             again.   They did not think it was polite to ask on such a short notice to such a busy
             woman, especially with baby on the way, but I thought I would ask on the side/sly. That
             way they will not have to know one way or another.

             If you are not busy, we would love for you to come give a quick speech, you are such an
             inspiration.

             Be blessed in all you do,
