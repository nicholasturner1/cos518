              Tali s,



               Did that get your attention? Thought so.



               So our thirteen year old daughter, Rachel, saw you on the news the other night. She
              looked over at me with a smile and said, "Daddy, is that the guy who always feeds you
              butter so he can-be lieutenant governor?". :)



               Kind of scary when even Rachel knows who my replacement is...ha
