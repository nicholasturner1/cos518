              I was reading this article and remembered that two 1/2 years ago while visiting your
              BEAUTIFUL state, how badly the talk was about governor that was before you. YOUR state
              deserves all the $ it can get and I hope to visit you again. We loved Mendenhall Glacier
              and Ketchikan the most. Next for us the interior Alaska. I wish you well. Susan

                public process, the governor said.

                 The proposed rule interpretation , aimed at Hawaiian Coastwise Cruises, would be a dramatic and abrupt shift
                in policy of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection if it were applied to Alaska cruises ," Governor Palin
                said in her letter. "Taking something that is working well and changing it - much less on 30 days notice - is
                not reasonable public policy."

                If adopted , the new rules could begin for next spring 's cruise season . About one million passengers visited
                Alaska by cruise last year.

                "Such a severe and short-notice change in itineraries as would be required under this proposal could create
                havoc for communities, travelers and the industry," the governor said in her comments to the Customs
                Bureau.

                "I ask that you either clarify that Alaska cruises are excluded from the Hawaiian Coastwise Vessels
                interpretation , or withdraw the proposed rule interpretation , perform a thorough review of the impacts, and
                then follow the normal federal rule -making process, including the opportunity to comment," Governor Palin
                said in the letter. This process is necessary to ensure adequate consideration of all the economic issues at
                stake."

                The governor was especially critical of the short public comment period provided by the Customs Bureau.

                "The official notice in the Federal Register on November 21 was the first public word of the proposed rule
                interpretation ," she said.

                                                                       ###
