          Ms. Palin, I live in the state of Georgia, but I know much about your success in
          government and your down to earth nature. I also think you are a beautiful person with a
          wonderful family.   I also think you would make a awesome Vice President of the United
          States.   I beg you to please be Senator McCain's Vice President. You would make a
          wonderful Vice president, and I beg of you to run as Senator McCain's Vice President. I
          dream of having you as the Vice President of the United States. You are so cool! Please
          do it! I'm no politician or anything, but I am just a guy in Georgia. Just a voter. I
          just have read a lot about you, and I am very impressed. You are more real, and I like
          that.   Please run, Governor Palin. Of anything, do it for me. :)
