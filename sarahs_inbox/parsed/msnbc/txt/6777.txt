               Governor Palin and Mike,

               I've attached a memo for the Alaska Workforce Investment Board (AWIB). Click and Tara have
               collectively made recommendations for five seats. They would like to begin changing out the
               members of this board . They've scheduled an AWIB meeting for May 8 and 9 in Juneau. Tara
               and I have met with Tibbles regarding these changes . I don't see a problem with
               recommendations the department brought forward. If you agree with the changes , I will let them
               know and begin contacting the new members.

               The first page is background information and the second page is a grid of the changes.

               Thanks so much,
