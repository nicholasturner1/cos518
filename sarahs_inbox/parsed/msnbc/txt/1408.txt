Our current program is similar to the previous class we taught in March /April. CH2M HILL has again
supplied instructors from our North Slope jobsite and we will be extending offers to all students who
successfully complete this three week course . We currently have 19 students participating and they
represent a broad portion of Southwest Alaska . There are also two individuals from Southeast
attending our Electrical training.



This graduation will be an occasion to celebrate the many partnerships that have made it possible to
train and employ these Alaskan residents. On that same note, we would like to see what you can
bring to the table, literally. There will be dinner following the brief graduation ceremony and if you are
interested in bringing a dish to make this a potluck setting we will celebrate together.



We would also like to notify those who are flying into King Salmon that Pen Air and Alaska Airlines
have multiple flights that are conducive to making this a daytrip.



Please RSVP to Annette Wilson at Annette @savec. org if you plan to attend . Shuttle service will be
provided from the airport to SAVEC. Hope to see you here.
