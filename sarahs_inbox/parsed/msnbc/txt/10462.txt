             Will I have time to get to military speech if we postpone this even a few minutes from the
             original time?

             I called the King Career Center in Anchorage and spoke to Guy Okada the Principal. He
             said they ' d love to have the bill signing there . He suggested the construction trade area
             and indicated that there is plenty of room for media , legislators, etc.



             I told him 1:30 p . m. He said that is fine but kids are dismissed at that time .                     I suggest
             starting at 1:15 . Thoughts ? ( Currently , the Governor is schedule to lpm).



             FYI, The contact for coordination , etc is Michelle Egan , 742-8900 .                Before anyone calls
             her, I need to follow - up with Mr . Okada and finalize the time.
