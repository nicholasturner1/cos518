              Habitat will be very low-key be it's going to be very controversial, as interpretted by
              Tzach - I spoke with him this morning at explained a bit of all this - so it can be
              covered tomorrow, and we do need a Fish and Game official there during that explanation
              (Denby or Ken Taylor or anyone), along with Dick Lefbvre... But if particular people
              mentioned can't make it then they need subs so I'm not left explaining their evaluation
              results myself.

             Governor-




             The online checkbook unveiling has to be done on the 10th floor (Admin) - they have a
             presentation that needs to be routed through their technical set-up. They would like to
             do it tomorrow. Can we have the Habitat announcement on Wed? I am still waiting to see if
             Denby will be in Juneau.
