             This is one of those heads up about a regs package that might be a story. . .not necessarily
             negative--it will however be another test these kids are required to take on top of
             existing testing.

             Subject: Work Ready/College Ready Transitional Skills Assessment REGULATIONS



            The State Board has adopted regulations relating to the work ready/college ready
            transitional skills curriculum and assessments.   The regulations will go into effect at
            the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year. They will require all 6th and 8th graders to
            take new benchmark assessments in the three main areas of Applied Math, Reading for
            Information, and Locating Information.   Also, 11th graders will be required to take the
            WorkKeyse <http://www.eed.state.ak.us/tls/CTE/workreadyfiles/docs/wk-tech-internet.pdf>
            assessments in those same three areas, at the state's expense.
