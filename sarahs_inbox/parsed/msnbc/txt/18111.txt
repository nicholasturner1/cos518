        Ask around if this is a good use of my time. And isnt the WGA pretty slammed by now with
        those last minute meetings that were just plugged in?

        Alaska's Governor is automatically an honorary member of Western Governors

        University. This is a quote from their website:



        "Western Governors University is a non-profit online university offering you

        a convenient, flexible online education. WGU is the only accredited

        university in the U.S. offering competency-based, online degrees. Founded by

        the governors of 19 western states, WGU delivers to its students an

        outstanding quality education under the guidance of dedicated faculty

        mentors and progress managers."



        I'll have Lynne Smith get some more info emailed to you. Bob Mendenhall is

        the President and has been trying to get in to brief you about WGU since

        January.     The meeting request is just for you and him.

        Hi Governor , would you be agreeable to a short meet and greet in South

        Dakota with Bob Mendenhall ,           President of Western Governor ' s University?

        He's been trying to fly to Juneau to meet you since you were elected, this

        might be a good way to meet him and that will be that! I ' ll wait for your

        approval.
