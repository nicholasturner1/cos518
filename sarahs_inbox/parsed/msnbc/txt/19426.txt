             So much for him not wanting to embarrass the Governor. Its so extremely apparent that its all about Walt.
             He doesn't care how this affects her in the least. He's unfortunately doing the same thing he did when
             Begich let him go, right to the press.

             I have heard from a few folks regarding his email that he sent the cabinet and the feeling is that no matter
             the situation and the reason for him being replacement his statement to the rest about not having access
             and don't let it happen to you was so inappropriate, folks have taken offense to his statements.

             Mike-

             I talked with the Daily News tonight about Walt. Kyle was really pushing for specific
             reasons why Walt was let go. Apparently - Walt is telling reporters that he has all the
             respect for the Governor but is baffled as to why he was fired.

            I stuck to the company line but Kyle wanted more . He asked me to ask you for more details. I
            told him I would but didn't expect to get in touch with you tonight.
