Dear Governor,

Thought you might like to read my book that I wrote in 1999. Capital Offense, a political/romance,
dealing with the governor of Alaska/the first women governor/ and the death penalty in Alaska. Of
course it is a fiction, but you will find it very true to life. My wife and I raised a large family in Chicken
Alaska. I was a columnist for the news-miner and ADN for twenty years. Anyhow thought you and
your family might enjoy this book this winter. You can read it off of my website
www.arcticark.us/book.htmi




If you read it drop me a note on how your family liked it. Our best to you and your family and a very
merry Christmas. Tom/Karen Williams and Family
