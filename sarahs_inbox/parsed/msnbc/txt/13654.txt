           I think if Rhonda and I put our heads together this week, we can bounce

           it around the rest of this group and pull something classy off by the

           end of the week (in cooperation with Rep Nelson's office) especially if

           it is the Governor's priority. What do you guys say? tj

           I love that. Let me know more, if you want to work on some such measure,

           please do! Great idea.

            Rhonda,



             Rep Nelson is talking about the Fox Radio that you mentioned last

           Wednesday.



             Unbelievable how far these folks push the envelope. Fagan is included

           right in there.



             F
