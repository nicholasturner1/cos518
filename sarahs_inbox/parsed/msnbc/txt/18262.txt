         Dear Ms. Wik:




         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

         When I heard about the $231 Million dollars that you cut out of our ."unneccesary" needs I
         was first concerned a bit I suppose but after hearing what was cut and what they were
         asking for I am pleased. It seems before you came to be our Governer there was allot of
         unneccesary spending.  Money is so much easier to spend when it's not your own, huh. On
         another note, I am so happy that we have a Woman like you as our Governer. Men don't
         multitask well, they get flustered and can't concentrate. As a multitasker myself I know
         you can get the job done and I have complete faith in everything you do. Your the Bomb
         Sarah.  I sure would like the opportunity to meet you someday when you come to Kenai.

         Have a great day.



         Your Friend
