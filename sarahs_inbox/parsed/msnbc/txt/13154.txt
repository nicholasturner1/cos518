            Watch the crazy games they'll play in these budget votes on the floor -( see email below)-
            ya wonder how long they can get away with these actions before we, or the press, or the
            public , does something about their untruthful words and actions . Up next will be their
            education funding bill actions that will attempt to look like they had to " fix" our
            funding plan - when the districts find out what they ' ll actually be adopting they will be
            back again next year asking for more $$$ , which I was trying to avoid . At least next year
            I'll be able to say : Nope , you got what you got and I got no help from you as I tried to
            forward-fund education . So I won't be the advocate for increased public school funding
            next year - we tried.

            Just insisted that ,the governor insisted the shooting ranges be put back in the budget",
            while on the floor. Gene had to object. Lyman's way off-base, I'm the one who cut the
            shooting/gun club(s) out of last year's capital, and have not insisted on putting any in
            this year's budget... He needs to be held accountable for saying such things.
