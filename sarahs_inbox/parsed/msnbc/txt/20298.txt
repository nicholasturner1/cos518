          The plan that seems to make most sense should be to find out exactly when my speech is
          (two speeches total)... then to travel a day before and a day after that main speech. I
          don't want to be there five days, no need to. Todd won't be able to go, it appears. So
          Trig won't be going, all the more reason to keep the trip short.

             I don't need staff besides Kris - we need to remember the GOP, for the most part...
          especially the AK machine.. .has not had any support or assistance provided our
          administration so our time and efforts will continue to be spent on serving Alaskans, not
          party politics.

              Pls also find out who pays for the trip. Thanks
