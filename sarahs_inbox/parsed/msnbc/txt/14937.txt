          MESSAGE:

          I just want to congratulate you on the birth of your beautiful baby Trig Paxon Van Palin.
          The first year will be the busiest time but it will get better. Remember God doesn't give
          you more than you can handle. Trig will be having a lot of doctors visit with speech,
          occupational, and physical therapy.   This sounds like alot but it isn't. He will just get
          most of this the first couple of years.

          My son Cody is 13 years old. He is the joy of my life along with his three sisters. Cody
          likes to ride his bike, play baseball, and don't forget the playstation 2. Just to show
          you there is no limitations on what he will do.

          You will find alot of family and friends at www.unomas2l . com. This web site is a great
          support.

          I hope it was all right to send this here , but I wanted to let you know that there is alot
          of support out here for you. This will not limit what you can do.

          Sincerely,

          Kristi Wegrzyn
