               Thank you. Would it be too difficult to turn an interview that day - or shall I just give
               him what I've got and setp an interview for later in the week?

              Journal of Commerce would like an interview on ag issues in the Valley. Rob
              Stapleton (no relation) has been waiting for an interview with you on ag
              issues for four months. Now with Mat Maid, the pressure is on again.



              Earlier today, I did forward to him the information below, as well as the
              following information:



              Rob,



              OMB forwarded a request for $600,000 in Agriculture Revolving Loan funds to

              the House and Senate Finance committees for consideration on April 26th.

              Karen Rehfeld was told that the request will be in the Senate version of the


              capital/supplemental bill that is due for release soon (perhaps

              today). Rehfeld was also told that the fund source will be GF.



              Thanks,

              Meg



              He is writing a story for Monday. Would you be interested in calling him on
              Monday?

              While I can't get a hold of the Governor today, she did provide her view in

              Governor Sarah Palin:

              Certainly, it would be good news to see a turnaround for the company because
              Matanuska Maid is a great part of Alaska's history. But evidence shows that
              outside competition has undercut Mat Maid's ability to continue the way it
              has been operating. The Board of Agriculture's request provides the time it
              wants for corporate planning - whether that means greater solvency or
              closing its doors.


              Thanks,
              Meg
