           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on the birth of your new son. And THANK YOU for setting an example of
           LOVE in accepting him with gratitude, despite his genetic imperfection, rather than
           destroying his precious life as so many others do. May God bless you and your family in
           all worthy endeavors!
