           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:



           Congratulations on the future addition to the family. When you first took office I had
           applied and was being considered for a position with your administration, however the
           President soon thereafter appointed me as Senior Counselor to the General Counsel, USDA. I
           will always appreciate the time your office took to try to place me even though I was not
           an Alaska native. You are thought of very highly at USDA. I would like very much to see
           you offered the Vice President's spot on the Republican ticket.



          Best Regards,



          Job Serebrov
