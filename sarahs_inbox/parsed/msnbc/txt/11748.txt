             I won't be picky about it but how did Gary know and/or ask for reserved seats?

             Governor - West Valley was not notified (as you had asked) from me. This was an official
             invitation that was received and we did not want them notified as you wanted to just drop
             by and not make an official event out of this. I do not know why they were now notified
             and seats are reserved for you.



             Gary if there is someone that I need to talk to in this regards concerning the seating
             please let me know who was notified and the contact number. Thanks, Janice

            We wanted to make sure West High wasn't preparing for me - they get disappointed if I do
            show and it's just supposed to be a drop-by. Don't know if that got communicated, but it's
            what Janice did work on. (That's the problem with inquiring about details of events- folks
            then think I'm showing up.). Maybe Janice can add to this.



            Also, if I am able to swing by I doubt it'll be a party of four so don't want them to
                                                                       1

             Governor,



             Jus trying to hep you here ...at your 6: 00 pm event at the Egan please just pull up to the
             front of the building , Bob has arranged for parking and will grab the vehicle.



             Officials at West High expect full capacity, 1900 people. The event will last about 1
             hour and they have reserved 4 seats for you and guests. If you suspect you need more
             seats , please let me know so we can arrange. Bob again will assist with the car.




             On Monday I will take the suburban in to DOT for repairs to the door.
