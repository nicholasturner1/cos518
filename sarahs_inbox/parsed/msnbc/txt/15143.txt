           Hello Governor Palin,    My name is Bob Hennefer and I have a 19 year old son Brad who also
           has an extra chromosome. I read a article in our local newspaper about the new addition to
           your family. Trig will bring you much joy. The world of Down syndrome has been a wonderful
           experience   for our family, community, and our school district. Brad is the only person in
           the country to have played two varsity sports for his high school for four years. Brad
           plays basketball and golf. He was featured in sports illustrated in the Feb. 25th issue,
           was on Good Morning America, and all of our local as well as national papers. Brad has a
           web site www.golfforlife.org that you can see all of his accomplishments. Your story was
           great and I wish you and are family much success with Trig. Bob Hennefer
