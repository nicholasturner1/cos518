           MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin

           I think you are doing a great job as governor. You make good decisions, are makeing us
           all proud of being Alaskans, and are cleaning up some of the political scandals of
           previous administrations.

           Great job!

           Thank you,

           Dale Brandt, Nome librarian
