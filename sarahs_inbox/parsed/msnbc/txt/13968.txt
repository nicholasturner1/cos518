                          Janice, could you please print out the attached for the Governor?

                          I found this letter in archived emails. It is from Mayor Keller from last year. I have Mark working with
                          Marty on another more detailed justification that will be formatted for a letter to editor. I've impressed
                          again the importance of ASAP.

                          Kris,
                          I wanted to let you know that I submitted the attached Compass Piece to the ADN today. I
                          hope that print it as it is not only a rebuttal it will also help to educate our residents in the
                          Mat-Su about the shelter and its capabilities.
                          Thanks,
