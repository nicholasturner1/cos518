              Karen,



             Thanks for the email. We also got the fax sent to our office.



             As an update my staff has been working with Senator Hoffman's office in an attempt to
             explore every option that is available to the help the community of Nikolski. Hopefully,
             we can track down a source of emergency funding.



             Bryce

             Subject: Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 11th, 2008




             Dear All,




             Nikolski placed a fuel order in July and has yet to receive the


                                                                       1




                                                                                                                  PRA GSP01_ 0009819

              delivery . The lack of fuel has stopped community projects ,          threatened

              property and the health of community members , and created an economic

              emergency due to the use of dedicated monies to charter in small amounts

              of very expensive fuel. To date , the Nikolski IRA has incurred over

              $48,000 of expenses in drums of fuel and a total of 8 air and marine

              charters . As of the last update, the barge was circling near Nikolski,

              awaiting a weather break.



              We are sorry to report that the situation in Nikolski has only worsened.

              The barge left Nikolski without delivering fuel on Tuesday night,

              reportedly due to weather.       The barge will service Cold Bay and

              Perryville before returning to fuel Nikolski . The earliest possible

              delivery would be January 18th but likely later due to forecasted

              weather . An additional problem are the undelivered heavy equipment

              repair parts that were on the barge ,     leaving air service unsecured as

              the runway cannot be properly cleared.



              The community will need more fuel before the new delivery date estimate,

              as a number of homes are out of heating oil and the power plant is using

              more fuel than recently as homes are being heated with electric heaters.

              APIA is currently working with Nikolski to arrange another small boat

              delivery of between 17 and 24 drums .      APIA will meet with Delta Western

              this afternoon to plan for the interim response.



              Please note, the financial situation for Nikolski has not been resolved,

              and there are no new funding sources to provide emergency           fuel to the

             village.   The cost of    the boat charter and fuel is about $10,000.

             Nikolski Tribal Government has exhausted their available operations

              funds and is now spending out the funds needed to support the staff of

              local government for 2008.




             We will be looking for the assistance of state ,        federal, and private

             entities to help respond to this crisis .        Thank you for your attention

             to this matter.
                                                                 2
