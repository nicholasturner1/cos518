                    CITGO Ad Effective at Improving Americans ' Perceptions of Venezuela and Chavez

                         -- Majority Viewed Ad as a Political Tool as Opposed to a Public Service Ad --

                Flemington, NJ, January 15, 2008 - Results of a national study released today revealed that
                while a CITGO public service ad elicited positive responses from Americans toward Venezuela
                and its president, the majority viewed the ad as a political tool.

                The study was conducted among 404 Americans during January 14- 15 to obtain Americans'
                views on an advertisement in which Congressman Joe Kennedy credits CITGO -- a Venezuelan-
                based company -- as the only oil company that donated fuel to help underprivileged Americans
                heat their homes . The communications research study was conducted by HCD Research and the
                Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.

                While viewing the advertisement, participants indicated their levels of believability by moving
                their mouse from left to right on a continuum. The responses were recorded in quarter-second
                intervals and reported in the form of curves. Participants were also asked pre- and post-viewing
                questions.

                 "The CITGO advertisement appears to have positive effect on Americans' perceptions of the
                 Venezuelan people and quite significantly increased their favorability of Hugo Chavez, president of
                 Venezuela," explained Glenn Kessler, president and CEO, HCD Research. "If the objective was to
                 improve the image of Venezuela, it worked."

                 "The automated response curves showed a significant decrease in believability as the narrator, Joe
                 Kennedy, suggests that our government cut fuel assistance and that American energy companies were
                 unresponsive. Democrats, Republicans and independents all dramatically decreased their levels of
                 believability," Kessler concluded.

                "While most Americans see the commercial as more of a political tool than a real attempt to help the
                needy get heating oil in the United States, the ad does succeed at marginally increasing the standing of
                both Venezuela and Hugo Chavez," commented Chris Borick, Ph.D., director of the Muhlenberg
                College Institute of Public Opinion,"

                The Media Curves web site provides the media and general public with a venue to view Americans'
                perceptions of popular and controversial media events and advertisements.
