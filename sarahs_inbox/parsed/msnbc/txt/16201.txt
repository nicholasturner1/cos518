           Good photo on the printed Clarion as well.



           And someone named Teedah left a "Sarah Rocks!" comment on Clarion's blog. Hmmm.

           Good morning Frank,



           The local newspaper, Peninsula Clarion, had a nice article in today's paper

           on the Governor's visit to Kenai yesterday. Work called me away from the

           event yesterday so I was unable to catch up with you, but we will see each

           other soon I'm sure. Have a great day Frank.



           Chuck

           With   tourism business leaders and government officials watching, Gov. Sarah Palin signs a
           bill   into law that will cut the price of a business license from $100 per year to $50 per
           year   during a ceremony at Kenai Landing on Wednesday afternoon . She also signed into law a
           bill   that will lower from 50 percent to 30 percent the funds tourism trade associations
           will   have to provide to match state funds.
