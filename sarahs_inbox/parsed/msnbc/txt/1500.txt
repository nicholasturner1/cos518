Erika,



Jay Ramars is spreading rumors that last fall during the special session for oil taxes (ACES) I was
walking the halls of the capitol with Sarah pushing for new oil taxes.

                                                      1                          ROSTON 02760

Please check my travel for that November month, I think I was never in Juneau during that time.



Thanks Todd

Todd,

 Linda thought it was a great idea to have Karen Newton and Connie Stewart at the tea due to the
vital role that they played in the House's history. The state can pay their expenses and they also
have Governor's office miles.
