            I agree - I do npt support their idea. I had not heard they were thinking about this. Mike
            Tibbles and Russ- pls make sure they know my opinion on this, because the $2 million will
            go the way of Stedman ' s Gravina money and other items that shouldn't be in the budget. Let
            me know who you reach and convince on this before they wrap up the budget. Thanks

            I read in this morning's Fairbanks News -Miner that the Legislature wants to appropriate $2
            million to itself for a national conference and public relations campaign to educate
            Americans about the impacts of a polar bear listing under the Endangered Species Act.
