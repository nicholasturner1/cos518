             We have kept Marty and the commissioners from direct communication with TC. I have
             already been in communication with them about this and they are working through how to do
             it.  They intend to have a decision by Monday .  I have plans to talk with them again
             Friday morning and can convey your sense of urgency.

             Would you place a call to TC letting them know I encourage allowing lawmakers to see their
             '04 proposal?
