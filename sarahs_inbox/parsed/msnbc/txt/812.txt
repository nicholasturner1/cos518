  Subject: Meeting Tuesday at 9:30am. & PSA dates for AK Trails, ATV Safety Project
  Todd,

  Randy and Linda can meet at the House tomorrow at 9:30am. They thought it better to not have a
  meeting with all the members since they've already approved the fundraiser and the gaming permit; I can
  follow-up with an email to update the members on what was discussed. We should set a date and time
  for a Foundation meeting either sometime in January or February, whatever works best with your
  schedule- you can participate via teleconference if that makes it easier.

  The Alaska Trails, ATV Safety Project asked if you'd be available for filming the PSA the week of January
  28-February 1.

  This is copied from the email that Jillian Morrissey sent me:
  The PSA will be shot outside, to account for this and hope for good weather and light we are
  blocking out
  one week, but the filming would only take one day. To maximze daylight hours, we are
  focusing on the week of January 28-February 1. Please let me know his availability and flexibility
  in this timeframe.
  Thanks,
  Erika
