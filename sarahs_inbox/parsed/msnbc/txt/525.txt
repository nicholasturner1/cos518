It is fascinating to watch the messaging. We have used the messages below -

and they have been reported. I think the mixing of the messages perhaps

comes from talk radio and others who think they know what the Governor wants

(Mat Maid / Creamery Corp / BAC). We will continue to emphasize and just

stick with the same message to reiterate our intent.



Thank you!

Joe,

 I'm a little worried about the way the Governor is handling this Mat

Maid thing. I still have a lot of faith in her and her ideas. But I

believe that maybe she isn't getting the whole picture on this dairy

business.

 Dairy nation wide has been supported by government for many decades.

Now with the ethanol growth the price of feed is going to put a squeeze

on even the best run dairy's in lower 48. Joe Van Treeck is a very

capable and honorable man. He has already done miracles keeping Mat Maid

operating for last 25 years.. He took a lot of heat early on by

importing milk to keep production up. Through out the years he has

introduce many innovative products to keep the dairy diversified. I do

believe that if Joe Van Treeck can't keep Mat Maid going then no one

can. My point is I don't want to see Sarah get into something which will

backfire and haunt her for the rest of her administration. Although she

is quite committed publicly almost Frank like. I do not believe that the

dairy can once again operate without lots of government dollars. If she

goes and puts 2-3 million dollars into to save livelihood of 4 or 5

farmers it will not set very well with a lot of people in the state.

Also by axing board members that aren't yes men she puts other state

directors into the position of maybe not being quite candid enough so as

not to lose their jobs. I don't really believe in the my way or highway

approach when you are dealing with knowledgeable people. You end up with

too many yes men and too many failed projects.
