            Governor, don't know that you received the note below regarding ENI's huge announcement as
            your email addy wasn't quite right.

            Hi Marty,



            Thank you.    70 wells!     Unbeliavable.



            Sharon was getting with Balash on this to run it. I told her Tom felt a quote from the
            Gov was appropriate for something this big.

            Attached is the ENI announcement which was made yesterday. I think Frank Bailey was
            working w/DOG on a Gov' s press announcement.

            Marty
