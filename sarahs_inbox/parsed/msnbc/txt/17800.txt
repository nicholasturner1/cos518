         Great idea - you can share with jason/andy so they can start thinking: of shooting I? If
         you want this done in-house.

         Might I suggest that you box some of those bottles, Governor (Erika can still remove all
         of them right now) and we tape you doing so while also speaking to the message. It is a
         great idea for a psa and shows that ultimately life, its actions, and consequences are
         about personal responsibility.

         Erika - would have the Govs Mansion's alcohol that's in the liquor cabinet boxed up and
         removed from "the People's House" downstairs in the public dining area?   Here's my
         thinking: with so many kids and teens coming and going in that house, esp during this
         season of celebrationstt for young people - proms, graduations, etc, I want to send the
         msg that we can be - and "the People's House" needs to be - alcohol-free. There's a lot of
         booze there - its too accessible and may be too tempting to any number of all those teens
         coming and going.

         We need to send this sobriety msg. it can be sent via support from Native Sobriety Assns,
         M. A. D. D. , Healthcare Strategies Council, or whomever can also benefit from the vocal
         support that I can provide them through this action, then I'll do it.

                   kari - fyi interview for record/schedule. also - security just called me on their
         way to pick me up for flight to skagway - now the problem is the King Air has a flat tire
         so can't fly afterall. My family is all on the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the
         niceities without me this evening in Skagway and I'll still try to get there somehow
         tomorrow.   what a continued zoo this is, trying to get from point A to point B - and i
         don't know why the flat tire wasn't discovered until a just now.

                  headed for the airplane for skagway. it's miserably wet and windy... i miss
         SouthCentral on days like this especially!



                    thanks for the skagway info... I'm printing it off now.



                    talk to you from blackberry if you need me... thanks so much for everything.

                          Ch. 2, Joy Mapaye, was wondering if you could call her for a quick
         interview. End of the session is here , how are things and with the arrests - is that too
         big of a distraction as the session ends? Her number is 762-9260 . Please let me know if
         possible - I could also look for Irwin. Interview should either happen before 4:30 or
         after 6:00.
