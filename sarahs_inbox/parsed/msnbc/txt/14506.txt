                 Subject: Regret Video Scripts

               Governor,

              I have attached the scripts of two regret videos that need to be filmed this week. They are also printed out for
              your convenience, and waiting for you in your office. I have placed the Combat Fishing script in the body of this
              email as it is brief, but the IOGCC video is about 3.5 minutes long, so. that is attached only. Just wanted to get
              these to you so that you have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the scripts and to determine if you
              wanted to see any edits. Thanks so much!
