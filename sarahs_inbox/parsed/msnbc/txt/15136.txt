           You all are amazing! You're loved and appreciated! Now lean over and slug Bruce for me,
           as I follow up with a hug for him next time I see him. :)

           Governor, you are appreciated!  Your visit was perfect for the team. When the Governor
           notices the team's dedicated hard work, the team's moral immediately increases.



            Thanks for the other suggestion. It will be discussed, argued as only we all can do.
           God bless.  Tom
