             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the birth of Trig. I just read your 'story' delivered to me by the
             Family Research Council. You are my hero. While I do not have a Downs baby or a
             traditionally labeled 'special needs' child - I treat all of my three boys as if they are
             'special needs.' Perhaps you could run for the Presidency next time - in your spare time.




             Blessings from a Pro-Life Mom in Tennessee
