Todd,



Tom Lopez will take care of purchasing your airline tickets while I'm gone. His cell 321-2364



Janice said that you and Mike Nizich would be visiting the Marine Exchange Facility. What date
would work for you? I copied the requst at the bottom of this email.



Have you decided on a date for the Spouses Luncheon? As soon as I get back to Jnu. I can come in
for an hour and have them mailed out or to get them out sooner- I can send out email invites followed
by a hard copy invitation.



You can call me on my cell if that's easier, we're just in Seattle running errands today.



Thanks,

Erika
