  Don't know if any of you heard it...but just before Eddie signed off he said, "and you won't
  believe what the Legislature's doing. Here Lyda Green's trying to give $200K to the Mat-Su
  Miners and their Board of Directors wrote her a letter saying they don't even need it! Its no
  WONDER Sarah Palin's holding these legislator's feet to the fire!"

  Delicious.

   Eddie...

   Check this out. Here's money being thrown at a baseball team by a legislator out in the
   Mat-Valley, and the team doesn't even support the state giving them the $200K.

   The. Legislature here is trying to make a big stink by throwing capital budget money into
   the supplemental (which isn't the place to put capital projects anyway ), yet this recipient
   in particular doesn't even want the $$.

       I spoke to Marty Metiva who is the President of the Board for Mat-Su Miners.
       He told me that they - the Board of Directors - do not support the $200k request
       that is in the supplemental budget. He wrote a letter to that effect to Senator
       Green last night. I expect a copy. He said that certainly they would appreciate
       funding but $200k is exorbitant; $50k would be more in-line. He further stated
       that the board unanimously voted on this and any request to the contrary wasn't
       authorized. His comment, which I appreciated, is they only touch about 4,000
       people which isn't worth $200k...
