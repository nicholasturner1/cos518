        The Chamber would like you to sign the workers compensation bill during your speech. I
        just checked with Chris Clark and we do not have the bill transmitted from the Legislature
        at this point. Speaker Harris needs to sign the bill before they will deliver it to us.
        Chris will check on the status this morning. We do have the option of doing a ceremonial
        signing if the official bill is only a day or so behind.
