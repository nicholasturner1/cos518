            MESSAGE:

            With the budget surplus, you should really look into extending the Elliot Highway that
            runs from the Dalton near Fairbanks to Manley Hot Springs all the way to Tanana. Here, a
            barge/ferry dock should be built with an incentive for the fuel companies to build a tank
            farm at the site across the Yukon River from Tanana. This project could potentially
            provide for significant savings regarding the future federal and state expenditures. More
            importantly, I believe that the project could reduce the cost of living or at least
            slow/stop the annual rise in costs of goods and services for the 19+ villages along the
            Yukon.



            Sincerely,

            Eric Matthew Huntington
