             Hey Ivy - The Fire Service Area Board met tonight to go over all of the

             charges in public and they voted to reinstate me as soon as possible! We'll

             have to see now what the Borough does.

             Hey Ivy, forgot to say Happy (belated) Valentines Day! It was good to chat

             last night, sounds like things are going very well for you in Juneau, it

            must be exciting to work for Sarah.



             The other thing I was going to give you a heads up on was that I planned on

             sending in my resume with a cover letter to Commissioner Monegan for the

             State Fire Marshal (Director of Division of Fire Prevention) position that

             is currently vacant.       With all of the controversy and stuff I am going

             through right now, I can understand if they would want to stay away from

             considering me for a state position.
                                                                      1

            Monday at 6pm is the public meeting with the Fire Service Area Board of

             Supervisors for them to see both sides and decide to either support or not

             support the Borough Manager's decision to terminate. I can explain more

             later, but I still have faith that things will work out in the end.



             Give me a call sometime,          Privileged

              Jack,




              Great to hear from you! Thanks for the email. How are things with you? I

              hope everything is coming together up there. I'm not impressed with some of

              the people up that way, but I guess I shouldn't talk about it in email.

              Give me a call some time if you have the chance.       Privileged Q
