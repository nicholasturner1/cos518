               Let me hear from tom /marty first . I'm willing to meet with them, as they requested
               yesterday , but may be advised against it if they' re just going to clobber us with
               criticism . Tom/Marty - what do you recommend- Bowles may NOT want to meet , afterall, but
               I'm game for making the overture . Could happen after our energy mtg?

              Governor - I called Bowles office to let them know that you would not be

              available per your email earlier today .             Would you like to have a

              meeting set for Anchorage tomorrow ?            Janice
