              Here's the tire tax info from the Revenue Sources book.

             Tire Fee
             The tire fee has two components. Th e
             first component is a tax of $2.50 on
             all new tires sold in Alaska for motor
             vehicles intended for highway use. The
             second component is an additional $5 fee
             per tire on all new tires with heavy studs
             sold in Alaska, and a $5 fee per tire on
             the installation of heavy studs on a previously
             un-studded tire. Our forecast of tire fee revenue is based
             on the expected number of vehicle registrations
             in the state.
