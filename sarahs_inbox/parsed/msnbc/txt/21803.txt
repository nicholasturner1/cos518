                Good morning-

                I'm in the Anchorage office this morning preparing for an RDC talk on Wednesday a.m. No one
                else is around so it should be productive. Feel free to call if you have anything you want to go
                over related to ACES, the RDC talk, or anything else. My direct line is 269-0325 (don't leave a
                voice mail on that one as I don't check it), and I've got my cell phone with me. Have a great
                day!

                Sean
