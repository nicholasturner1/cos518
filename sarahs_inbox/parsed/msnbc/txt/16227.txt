            Governor Palin Pleased with FERC Decision



            June 19, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided today
            that the owners of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline - BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc.,
            ConocoPhillips Transportation Alaska Inc., Exxon Mobil Pipeline Company, Unocal Pipeline
            Company and Koch Alaska Pipeline Company LLC.- failed to prove that their 2005 and 2006
            rates were just and reasonable. The FERC ordered refunds to TAPS shippers that are
            estimated to result in at least $600 million, plus interest, in additional tax and royalty
            revenues to the state.



            "I am pleased that the FERC agreed with the ruling made by our state regulators in 2002,
            that the rates being charged by the TAPS carriers were not just and reasonable," Governor
            Palin said.  "This decision shows how having a pipeline constructed and operated by the
            producers can result in inflated tariff rates that cause the State of Alaska significant
            revenue losses and discourage others who do not own a share of the pipeline from
            developing the state's oil and gas resources."



            The case began in 2004 when the state protested the proposed 2005 rates. Anadarko and
            Tesoro also challenged the rates. The FERC will set a new rate for future shipments after
            the TAPS carriers make a compliance filing. The Departments of Revenue and Natural
            Resources will be able to calculate the total revenue owed to the state after the FERC
            determines the timing of the refund payments and sets the prospective rate.
