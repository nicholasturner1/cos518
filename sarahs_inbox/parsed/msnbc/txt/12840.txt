                                    U.S. Senate Passes Second Chance Act

                                    The U.S. Senate passed today the Second Chance Act of 2007. This landmark
                                    bill, introduced by Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE), Sam Brownback (R-KS),
                                    Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Arlen Specter (R-PA), provides critical resources
                                    designed to reduce recidivism and increase public safety. The legislation
                                    passed the Senate by unanimous consent and now proceeds to the President's
                                    desk for signature.

                                    "The passage of the Second Chance Act reflects the strong consensus that
                                    improving prisoner reentry is not a partisan issue, but a matter of public
                                    safety, improving lives, and making effective use of taxpayer dollars," said
                                    Assemblyman Jeffrion Aubry, Justice Center board member and chair of the
                                    New York State Assembly Correction Committee.

                                    The Second Chance Act includes key elements of President Bush's Prisoner
                                    Reentry Initiative, announced in the 2004 State of the Union address, which
                                    provides for community and faith-based organizations to deliver mentoring
                                    and transitional services. The bill will also help connect people released from
                                    prison and jail to mental health and substance abuse treatment, expand job
                                    training and placement services, and facilitate transitional housing and case
                                    management services.

                                    "It is vitally important that we do everything we can to ensure that, when
                                    people get out of prison, they enter our communities as productive members
                                    of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycles of recidivism and
                                    violence, " said Senator Leahy. "I hope that the Second Chance Act will help

                                          According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, an
                                          estimated 95 percent of all state prisoners will be released-with half of these
                                          individuals expected to return to prison within three years for the commission
                                          of a new crime or violation of their conditions of release. This cycle of
                                          recidivism not only compromises public safety, but also increases taxpayer
                                          spending. A February 2007 report from The Pew Charitable Trusts stated that
                                          if federal, state, and local policies and practices do not change, taxpayers are
                                          expected to pay as much as $27.5 billion on prisons alone from 2007 to 2011
                                          on top of current corrections spending.

                                          "The Second Chance Act will provide an opportunity for realistic
                                          rehabilitation for the more than 650,000 inmates who return to their
                                          communities each year," said Senator Specter. "The bill's focus on education,
                                          job training, and substance abuse treatment is essential to decreasing the
                                          nationwide recidivism rate of 66 percent."
