          Governor,

          Hal Kvisle was intending to restate the same message they've been sending, which is that
          the Alaska Gasline project will need customers and if they (TC) can attract ExxonMobil
           (which everyone recognizes is the hardest nut to crack) then all the other gas producers
          will be more likely to follow. Hal was NOT suggesting TC would not follow-through on
          their AGIA commitments, nor their work schedule. Nor was he suggesting that the State of
          Alaska needed to do anything beyond what we've already provided as upstream inducements in
          AGIA (I.e. Tax fiscal certainty for 10 years, and Royalty Valuation and switching
          certainty).



          Finally, did you see the TransCanada Talking Points I sent you yesterday?

          Marty

         Governor, We have TC working on it already. An explanation will be issued today! Plus,
         Tony, Patty, Tom, Pat, Joe and I talked to as many Legislators as possible explaining
         Hal's intended message
