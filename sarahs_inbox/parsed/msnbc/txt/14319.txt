           Subject: Gas Tax Holiday



           AG/Commissioner:




           Upon further review, Georgia suspended the state's gas tax in 8 days. Governor Perdue
           issued an executive order on September 2, 2005 and the Legislature ratified the order on
           September 10.




           I've attached two Georgia executive orders for your review. One suspends the state's gas
           tax for 1 month and the other lowers the state sales tax on natural gas for home heating
           for 4 months.
