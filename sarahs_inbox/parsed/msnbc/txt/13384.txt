             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin:



             Just when I think I couldn't like or admire you more I read the article in the Daily News
             this morning.  I would just like to say what an'absolutely remarkable woman I think you
             are and what a remarkable family you have. And I am especially impressed with your
             statement that Trig is a gift from God. What an absolute truth.



             You show so much intergrity and moral values in the face of adversity that it is beyond
             words.



             I for one am so glad and proud that you are the Governor of our great state.



             God bless you and your family.
