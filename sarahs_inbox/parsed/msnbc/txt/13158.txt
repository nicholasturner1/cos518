                     I urge passage this session of these bills which will deter ballot box game management. Our fish and
                game resources are best managed by professionals not by hysteria . The public has ample opportunity to
                voice their opinions at Board meetings and by petitioning the governor and legislators regarding people
                selected for the Boards.
