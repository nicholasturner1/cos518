        Excellent thank you. And I just spoke to Matt Simon- he basically wanted to know what I
        thot of the criticism on the radio that continues about Agia. He named Halcro as the big
        critic. I was so tempted to give my personal take on Halcro but for now I'm biting my
        tongue with Simon and KTVA.

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                    07-088




        Governor Palin Urges Public Process in Proposed Beluga Decision




        April 20, 2007 , Juneau , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today voiced her concerns about the
        implications of the proposed endangered species listing of Cook Inlet's beluga whales.
        The Governor also encouraged the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct public
        hearings on this important issue.

         "Listing Cook inlet beluga as endangered under the Endangered Species Act may have
         significant implications for activities throughout the Southcentral region of Alaska,"
         said Governor Palin . " we are going to closely review all the scientific information in
         the proposal and encourage the communities of the cook Inlet region , as well as fishing
         and industry groups to express their views."




         The State of Alaska shares the National Marine Fisheries Service ' s concerns for the
         conservation of the beluga population in Cook Inlet .  However , the State is going to
         closely review all the scientific information in the proposal to be sure it meets the
         requirements for listing under the Endangered Species Act .  Additionally , the State will
         study whether existing federal law , such as the Marine Mammals Protection Act, provides
         sufficient protection.




        Federal law allows harvest by Alaska Natives only .  An agreement to restrict harvest in
        Cook Inlet was implemented in 1999 , but the Cook Inlet belugas have not recovered. No one
        in the scientific community has been able to identify what is impeding the growth of this
        population.
