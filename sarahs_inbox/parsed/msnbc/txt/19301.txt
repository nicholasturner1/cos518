               Governor.

               Anna and I have finished meetings with the second team of experts on the grants to utilities legislation. I
               am working now on a status report and recommendations on all remaining open policy items related to
               legislation for the special session. I should have that to you by the morning.

               Steve Haagensen may send you an e-mail on some of the issues. You may want to wait until you . receive
               our status report and recommendations before responding to. him.

               Thanks,

               Randy
