          MESSAGE:

          Is it true that you have filed suit against the Feds because the Feds will not allow the
          sale of excess fuel held by Alaska? Please send me applicable information related to this
          subject.  Why are we paying so much for fuel to be imported, when it is available in our
          country?  I'd like to contact some local politicians about this, but I want the facts
          right.




         Congratulations to you and best wishes in your term as Governor.




         Sincerely,




         Melissa Wentworth

              2. ALLIED WASTE GETS POSITIVE REPORT CARD
                 Investment rating agency Fitch Ratings recently upgraded its outlook for
                 Allied Waste Industries. The agency believes that Allied's strong cash flow,
                 pricing discipline, and efforts to reduce debt have improved the company's
                 credit profile. Despite the continuing decline in volumes, estimated to be
                 between 1.5%-3% in 2008 due to the slowing U.S. economy, pricing is
                 expected to remain firm and projected to Increase by 4.5% in 2008.
                 Pricing strength appears to be holding across the industry, as virtually all
                 of Allied's major competitors are now focusing more on return on invested
                 capital (ROIC) and margins, rather than on volumes and market share
                 when making pricing decisions. This is especially true with stronger landfill
                 pricing which drives pricing up the chain including collection and
                 processing... Read More))


              3. BEST BUY ROLLING OUT FREE E-WASTE RECYCLING PROGRAM
                 The nation's largest consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Is rolling out a
                 free electronic waste program where consumers will be able to bring in up
                 to two items per day at participating Best Buy stores. It Is believed to be
                 the most extensive electronics recycling program by any retailer to date
                 and is naturally being haled by the Consumer Electronics Association. The
                 trial covers 117 Best Buy stores across eight states that will collect a wide
                 variety of old electronics at no charge. Results of the trial will determine
                 whether they expand the recycling program to all 922 stores in the US.
                 The company agreed to set up the recycling trial under pressure from "As
                 You Sow," a social responsibility group, which had threatened a

              4. PLASCO ENERGY PROPOSES TO BUILD $125 MILLION PLASMA
                 PLANT FOR OTTAWA, ONT.
                 Plasco Energy Group has offered to build a $125 million waste-to-energy
                 plant for the City of Ottawa, Ont. Under the proposed deal, Plasco would
                 cover the cost of construction and in return, the city would enter a long-
                 term contract to supply the plant with post-recycled waste paying Plasco
                 about $8 million a year in fees. The city generates about 300 thousand
                 tonnes of waste per year but with new recycling systems set to begin next
                 year, hopes to divert as much as 60% of that stream. The Plasco plant
                 would take the rest: about 400 tonnes of garbage per day, or about 136
                 thousand tonnes per year. With Ontario government approval, Plasco says
                 the plant could be operational by 2010... Read More s

              5. TRADE GROUPS PRESS EPA ON GREENHOUSE REPORTING
                 REQUIREMENTS
                 Two of the waste industry's biggest trade groups are urging the US EPA to
                 consider much of the progress already made by the industry to reduce
                 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions before proceeding with its rulemaking.
                 In a joint letter to the U.S. EPA, the National Solid Wastes Management
                 Association (NSWMA) and the Solid Waste Association of North America
                 (SWANA) commented on the agency's draft mandatory greenhouse gas
                 (GHG) reporting and its potential Impact on municipal solid waste (MSW)
                 landfills. Specifically the groups want the EPA to consider the industry's
                 already substantial success in reducing GHG emissions, establish a
                 protocol for estimating fugitive landfill emissions, account for carbon
                 sequestration in estimating GHG emissions from landfills, and exclude
                 biogenic GHG emissions from reporting requirements ... Read More))


              6. NEW LANDFILL-GAS-TO -ENERGY PROJECT FOR BREVARD
                 COUNTY, FLA.
                 Brevard County, Florida's Central Disposal Facility (Cocoa Landfill) last
                 month began converting its gas to energy. The $11 million system
                 employs six 1.6-megawatt Caterpillar engines to produce enough
                 electricity (9.6 MW) to power more than 6,000 homes. Michigan-based
                 Landfill Energy Systems funded the project which includes a 6,000-
                 square-foot plant. In return for the rights to the gas, the county Is to
                 receive a cut of the estimated annual revenues of $400,000 over the 20-
                 year contract. Landfill Energy Systems, meanwhile, earns federal tax
