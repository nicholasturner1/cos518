              The Honorable Governor Sarah Palin,

              Thank you for coming to Seward for the Centennial of the Iditarod. People were very impressed with
              your fortitude towards the cold and wind! Here are some pictures I took of the event. Again, thank you
              for coming to Seward and we hope to have you back soon. You might also look on sewardcitynews.com
              where there is a video clip posted.

              I couldn't figure out how to post these on the News. These are fresh off the camera.
