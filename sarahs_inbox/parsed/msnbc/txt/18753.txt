         From Kyle Hopkins at the federal courthouse --

         Pollster David Dittman took the stand again after lunch ,              as the jury looked at a list of
         three or four Veco-paid polls that he conducted in 2006.

         One of those polls cost $ 20,000 and was for then Gov. Frank Murkowski . Dittman said the
         poll was initiated by Murkowski or his chief of staff, Jim Clark , and paid for by Veco.
