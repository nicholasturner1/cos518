           Thank you for the excellent job, you are doing . Your vetoes were perfect!



           At last we have a real Governor, "who stands up for us by standing up to us"

           outstanding!




           Your leadership is inspiring.

          Get some national exposure.   You are to good to stay in Alaska, we need you running the
          country.  You are one of the few women I've seen that I would vote for. There are not
          many men that I would vote for either. I wish you were the Republican pick this time.
          The Republicans finally have their own liberal/socialist running for President. It's
          going to be hard to vote for McCain, that is, unless you are his running mate. Looking
          forward to seeing you on the National scene.
