           The Pat Forgey story is out.



           Should I call him this morning and explain that back in 2006 during the campaign there was
           not a pending motion in federal court for a permanent injunction against the project?



           This fact alone justifies an approach of not going out to bid on the project or moving
           ahead.. You could put the bid out, pay the contractor to mobilize equipment and for tens
           of thousands of dollars in other costs, only to have the court grant the injunction and
           stop the project dead in its tracks before a single shovel full of dirt was turned. This
           would be a complete waste of dollars and could strand a contractor and his employees in
           the middle of the building season with no work.



          As usual, Forgey leaves this key fact out of his story. Can we legislate journalistic
          integrity and competence?
