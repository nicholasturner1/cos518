                 Governor Palin, first of all, congratulations on the birth of your son. I wish him the very
                 best.

                 Please consider supporting access to health care for all Alaskans, no matter how old they are
                 or where they live. As a cancer patient, 72 years old, without Medicare, we would have lost
                 our savings. We do have a secondary insurance for which I am grateful but some people
                 cannot afford a secondary insurance due to the high cost of insurance.

                 Thank you for your attention to this very important issue. Kaye F. Hard
