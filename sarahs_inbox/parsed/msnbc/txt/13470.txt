           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,



           May we first congratulate you and your husband on the birth of your new son, Trig Paxson
           Van Palin. What a wonderful name for a very loved and special child.

           We have been long time supporters of the University of Alaska ,

           Anchorage and particularly it's athletic programs. Both our men's and women's basketball
           teams had an outstanding season this year and UAA hosted the Western NCAA Basketball
           Regionals. The Wells Fargo Sports Arena proved less then adequate to accommodate the
           demand for seats for this event as well as many other sporting events during it's many
           years of existance.

           We truly feel our athletes and students deserve a much bigger. and improved facility to
           maintain the excellence of all the sporting events offered at UAA.

           The community of Anchorage has always supported UAA and a new facility would enhance that
           support.

           We respectfully ask that you consider signing the pending bill asking for $15,000,000 to
           fund the planning and site preparation of a new sports arena.



           Sincerely yours,

           Thomas and Victoria Packer

                                                                 1
