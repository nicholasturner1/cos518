        Subject: Today's editorial




        Sharon and I are very un-impressed with the editing Zencey did on my op-ed this morning.
        Rearranging paragraphs, eliminating references to the Big Three, chopping my intro
        paragraph, etc... I thought it certainly weakened the piece. Reminds me of the campaign
        when I'd try to get an op-ed published and they'd only agree to do so after hacking it.



        Hopefully more ACES and AGIA pieces can more attractively explain our enery policy
        positions . Hopefully other op-eds will be submitted asap , as we need to step up with
        messaging to Alaskans today.
