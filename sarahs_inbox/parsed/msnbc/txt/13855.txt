            Thank you Randy. Glad we're demanding they uphold the lease agreement.

            Subject: AMHS / Prince Rupert Dock




           Governor:



           We received notice late yesterday that the City of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, has
           closed the dock it leased to AMHS for repairs. AMHS has had some concerns about the dock
           and asked Prince Rupert as the landlord to get a survey done. When the survey came in it
           showed some significant problems.



           AMHS has been scrambling ever since. We have received permission from the BC Ferry system
           to use their dock which is fairly close by. Commissioner Von Scheben has sent an engineer
           and a shore-side dock expert to Prince Rupert to assess the situation and make sure our
           vessels can use the BC Ferry System dock. The first AMHS vessel will attempt to use the
           dock at 3:00 am Sunday night. We are meeting on Sunday to hear the results and discuss
           options.



           The Department of Law is sending a demand letter to the City of Prince Rupert to comply
           with the lease terms to maintain the dock and fix it as soon as possible.



           DOT's communications officer, Roger Wetherell, is issuing a press release and handling
           press inquiries.



           I will keep you updated as events unfold.
                                                                 1
