             Who do I work with to get access to "input" on the calander? I hate to keep bugging
             others about my ached. I'm happy to do the inputting myself so nothing falls between the
             cracks... Just need to know how I get access to allow me to start inputting these events
             and appts for the official record.

             You speak at 10:00 am at the Sheraton. Harris is at 11:30 and McBride at 1:30. These
             latter meetings came up yesterday afternoon when Janice was out so we'll get them added
             today. She'll be here this morning.

             Also, i still need to see any tentative events/invitations so i can start picking and
             choosing what I can attend, to allow me plenty of time to prepare for events, esp the
             speeches. Thanks.
