                Hi Meg,

                Here's a portion of the text from the May 6, 2005 full-page ad that appeared
                in the News-Miner and in support of the Alaska Gasline Port Authority's
                project:

                "As concerned citizens who love Alaska , we are speaking up in favor of the
                best and only proposal that provides maximum benefits to the state. The risk
                of inaction is too high. We urge you to get involved, too."

                Gov. (then mayor) Palin appeared in the ad , and provided her signature,
                along with Hammond, Hickel and Halford.

               I'd like to know if the governor stands by the statement that the port
               authority plan is the "best and only proposal that provides maximum benefits
               to the state," disavows that statement, or has some other comment on it.


               Thanks much.

               Rod Boyce
