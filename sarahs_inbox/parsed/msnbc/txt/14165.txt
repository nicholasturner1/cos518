            Word out of DC has it as BP and Conoco going ahead with the pipeline project. It's third-
            hand, but the person I spoke to said that the announcement will be that they are going
            ahead on their own without the State. When I asked whether it's a commitment to build or
            just a commitment to spend additional funds, they demurred.



            Also, it sounds like the congressional delegation is going to take the credit...

            It is something involving BP and Conoco. They will have a press release out at 9 am with
            a press conference at 10 am.
