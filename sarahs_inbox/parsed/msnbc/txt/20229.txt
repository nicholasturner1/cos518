              Governor,

              Here are. your remarks and event info for the bridge dedication and bill signing in Nenana. Two things I should
              mention are that 1) Mitch Demientieff (Shirley's brother) is Chief of Nenana; and 2) there will be some
              construction on the highway, and DOT recommends that you leave Wasilla no later than 10 a.m. I'll include more
              information on road conditions in your briefing booklet Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can
              be of further assistance. Thank you!
