                       Honorable Governor Sarah Palin
                       State of Alaska
                       P.O. Box 110001
                       Juneau, AK 99811-0001

                       Dear Governor Palin,

                       We believe protecting all waters adjacent to the Arctic Ocean is of paramount
                       importance. In this effort we are working together with the members of Alaska Marine
                       Pilots as we fully support their position in this matter.

                       We request your support in protecting our northern waters by endorsing the proposed
                       regulation that would extend the compulsory pilot requirement to include the Arctic.

                       Respectfully Yours;




                       Captain Jeff Pierce
                       President
                       Southwest Alaska Pilots Association


                       cc:      Emil Notti, Commissioner of Commerce
                                 Lynne Smith, Special Assistant to the Governor
                                 Joe Austerman, Chairman, Board of Marine Pilots
                                 Captain Mark DeVries, USCG
