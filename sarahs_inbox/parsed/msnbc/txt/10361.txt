             This was all correct. I never thought about the angle of the Governor's father being a
             teacher.  It has always been about how we can best pay down the unfunded liability, and
             with the savings from paying it down now, have less of a future obligation so that money
             can be invested in other State needs.

             It is only TRS.

             Although we do have a current unfunded liability of more than $8 billion for the state's
             retirement systems -- $3 .1 billion for the Teachers Retirement System and $5.4 billion for
             the Public Employees Retirement System , this proposal is only for TRS.



             During the 2007 session, the legislature appropriated $270 million to school districts and
             the University of Alaska for TRS and $185 million to PERS employers.



             The administration will continue to take action to reduce the entire liability.



             But this proposal is for $450 million in funds from the FY08 surplus would be deposited to
             TRS to reduce the unfunded liability and provide future savings in the State's required
             contributions to TRS.




             The TRS is almost completely funded with general fund dollars. Making a FY 08 general fund
             contribution to TRS will give the State the "biggest bang for the buck" on reducing the
             amount of general fund dollars necessary in the FY09 and future budgets for the TRS.



             The projected savings to the state would be $43.1 million. The savings would continue each
             year until the unfunded liability is reduced to zero.

             The net present value of the total savings over a 25-year period is $607 million.

             MESSAGE:

             On the State website you state that the two year savings plan includes a $450 million
             contribution to the unfunded liability of TRS . Would it be more accurate to have printed
             TRS/PERS ? If not, why not ? As a public employee I am deeply concerned if contributions
             to the unfunded liability are inequitably distributed and hope that this is not a
             prejudiced contribution because of family professions . Thank you.

                Mike,
                 Sony I missed your call today. I just picked up messages tonight and left you a message on your cell . I think the governor's draft
                remarks are generally pretty good but I have a few suggested changes:
