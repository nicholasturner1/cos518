            Hi R- hope you're having a good weekend.



            There were a few Ft Wainwright visit pictures in Fairbank's newspaper yesterday- could
           you get them so I can sign for Oscar Hall and the soldier shown in one of them- I could
           only see the pics online, but they looked. like appropriate ones to signature and send from
           our office. Thanks! (Maybe a copy for the base, too, as one pic showed Todd looking at
           their Wall of Honor.)
