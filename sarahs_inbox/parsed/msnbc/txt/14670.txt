            Governor     On Saturday, May 3 - for the Bike Blessing Event - we had you scheduled for
            11:00 - 11:15 a.m. for reading of the Proclamation. We have just received the Final
            Agenda and it states that the Bikers will begin arriving at the Park Strip at 12:30 p.m.
            therefore they are asking that you speak at 1:20 p.m. Janice
