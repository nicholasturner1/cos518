              Subject : Passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones -




             Governor -



             Nick Begich just called to let us know about the passing of Chief Marie Smith Jones, the
             last native speaker of the Eyak language .  She was 89 years old . Mr. Begich ' s wife is
             Sheila Slate who is the adopted daughter of Chief Smith.   Sheila and Chief Jones met the
             Governor at an event at the Alaska Native Heritage center just a month or two ago. Chief
             Slate thought the world of the Governor , and so her family just wanted to let the Governor
             know of her passing . The funeral is this Friday , with a viewing from llam - lpm and funeral
             service at 1:00.  Then they 'll have the traditional potlatch after 40 days.



             Note :      We have short staff in ANC so I don't know if we want Colleen or I can check w/Lt.
             Governor on attending this service. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted Iso we will be down
             to Abbey , Colleen in office on Thursday and Friday - 01.24 ,              01.25 .    Thanks , Janice
