              I haven't seen his memo to the cabinet and at this point I don't even want to. If his intention is to
              make it public then I am extremely disappointed in his action - especially when he'd been offered
              a more appropriate job assignment so he could help serve the state in a different capacity.

              So much for him not wanting to embarrass the Governor. Its so extremely apparent that it's all about Walt.
              He doesn't care how this affects her in the least . He's unfortunately doing the same thing he did when
              Begich let him go, right to the press.

              I have heard from a few folks regarding his email that he sent the cabinet and the feeling is that no matter
              the situation and the reason for him being replacement his statement to the rest about not having access
              and don't let it happen to you was so inappropriate , folks have taken offense to his statements.

              Mike-

              I talked with the Daily News tonight about Walt. Kyle was really pushing for specific
              reasons why wait was let go. Apparently - Wait is telling reporters that he has all the
              respect for the Governor but is baffled as to why he was fired.
              I stuck to the company line but Kyle wanted more. He asked me to ask you for more
              details. I told him I would but didn't expect to get in touch with you tonight.

             Were replacing Walt with Chuck Kopp from Kenai . Its all good. Except we asked Walt to move to the ABC Board
             Ex Dir position so he could utilize his talents and connections with Rural Ak and help address the bootlegging
             problem (leading to horrendous other problems ) in our villages... he said no to that offer. Chuck starts on Monday.

              I understand that. Sometimes one's ego or pride gets in the way of the higher mission, like going from
              Commissioner to Director and the impression that it is a demotion . In that case, it is about the person and
              not the mission.

              As part of your administration , I say we must keep our eye on the ball and do whars best for Alaskans. I
              don't want this situation to affect the vote on the energy bill. I want to stay focused on the gas line and
              Alaska's future economyl If I can help, let me know.

                    I read what is on the ADL webpage . I think Sharon's response so far is good. I expect to get calls come
                    Monday from the rural caucus and stakeholders in Rural Alaska and probably big native corps like AFN,
                    CIRI, all the BB's, Pribilofs, Interior and Northwest.

                    My stance. is that it is not unusual for an Administration to change people out as the Governor sees
                    appropriate to meet her goals for Alaska . Let me know if I need to say something different. tj

              The ADN ran 4 gas pipeline/energy plan compass pieces in their Sunday addition written by:
    E         Gregg Erickson, Fagan, and Halcro. The fourth was the ADN editorial. Aftre the summary I
              included the link for you guys.

              ADN Editorial: The bottom line was With TransCanada's bid, the state has a strong card for
              getting what Alaska needs in the gas line game. This is. no time to give that card up." Very
              positive piece. They write that they disagree with former Gov Knowles proposal to suspend
              AGIA saying it would work against the interest of Alaskans.
              http://www.adn.com/oRinion/story/463266.htral


              Erickson: He's praising the governor for her energy rebate plan. He agrees the payments
              represents a distribution of Alaskas resource wealth, and then goes thru some arguments from
              legislators: Doogan says the resources are commonly, not individually owned; Gara says we
              shouldnt give a divided to rich Alaskans (we could point out its optional to accept the rebate);
              lastly, he says some legislators dont see an end to giving out the rebate on an annual basis. He
              concludes with saying that Palins plan is better than any political alternative, and legislators
              should get over their fear of letting go of control ofstate resources.

              http://www.adn. com/opinion/storv/4-63270.html



              Fagan: Fagan continues to write crap. This piece is about what he calls the list of all of the
              blunders of the administration and campaign. His list includes: Wasilla Chamber debate when
              the governor said shed favor Wasilla; demonizing the former Mat-Maid board and then replacing
              them all; a joint appearance by the governor and Tom Irwin on Fagans show when the governor
              said she was negotiating w producers and Tom said the state was not; the governor on the
              Pocarro show saying ACES creates an atmosphere of investment; the governor using the word
              competition to describe agia; the governor calls the denali project an 1 I pg PowerPoint
              presentation; the governor accuse oil companies of warehousing our gas; the governor declares
              Pt Thompson is no longer needed to build a pipeline. He ended with saying-the ultimate
              deception was crafting a carefully worded op-ed last week re: statehood book. He says he talked
              with the FL publishing company and they said they worked closely with the administration.

             Im happy to work with Sharon , Frank, Tom, etc on tracking down what was actually said during
             these various appearances to correct his untruths point by point.

             httn:I/www.adn.com/opinion/story/463268.html



             Halcro: Halcro pc is on rah rah policy making . To try and discredit the in-state plan he used a
             quote from Doogan from last week, "As I understand it, what's different between today and the
             day before there was a press conference is that there has been the announcement of a partnership
             that has yet to be formed, to ship gas that has yet to be discovered in what seems to be the wrong
             direction, in a pipeline that has yet to be built and details will follow.

             Halcro chooses not to mention that Doogan went on to commend the governor for trying to find
             a solution to the energy crisis, and for supporting an in-state line where Alms get gas first.

             He also tries to discredit the argument that the TC plan is an insurance policy that keeps the
             producers honest. He writes that Pat Galvin said if a future legislature adopts new tax rules or
             fiscal certainty to move a gas pipeline forward and Denali also moves forward it will trigger the
             treble damages clause and the sate would be forced to pay TC more than $ 100 million. Halcro
             calls it the Thelma and Louise insurance policy . We join hands with TC and it ensures we drive
             off the cliff.
