                     Governor,

                     Fairbanks sounds good to me - warm weathers Have you determined if you

                     wish to make the AGIA bill signing an "event" by inviting potential

                     applicants, or keep it lower key? if you decide to invite industry, we

                      should begin to get it on their schedules.

                     Marty

                       Where are you going to sign the AGIA bill , how about

                       Fairbanks , it's one of the largest Cities in the state

                       without Natural Gas ( besides being trucked from the

                       valley ) and is only a few hundred miles away from the slope.
