               Russ says in walking the halls the universal msg he receives re: why legislators have
               chips on their shoulders, mad at us (even republicans who like us) is based on one msg
               they heard me say through the budget process when I made my cuts: "we need an adult in
               the house.".



               Ironically, when Russ asks, he's told it's Bitney perpetuating that msg, rubbing it in and
               reminding legislators I said it. The irony is it was Bitney who gave me that line, and it
               was in either an email or a budget roll-out speech that he wrote that in.



              If anyone recalls that or has that, pls let me know, as it would help turn down Bitney's
              volume on that "gotcha" issue he's capitalizing on and screwing working relationships
              over.
