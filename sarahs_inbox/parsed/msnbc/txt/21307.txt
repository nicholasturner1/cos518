             Hi, I think i saw you on Charlie Rose. I was woundering if you were interested in a
             portrait oil painting. I am very good and cheap. I mostly paint for friends but am
             interested in painting you. Let me know what size, i think 16x20 is standard portrait size
             and if i can paint from one of your photos.

             Sincerely,

             Allon
