            Pls have someone look at the recent statewide press awards and do "congrats" to those
            recognized - KTUU photog won national award, Julia O'Malley won, etc... Some of the local
            media outlets also. Then pls let me know who followed through on it and where the
            "congrats" were sent. Thanks
