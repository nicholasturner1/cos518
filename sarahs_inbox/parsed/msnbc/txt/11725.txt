             MESSAGE:

             Governor:
             A lot of conservatives in the lower 48 watch your accomplishments and your name comes up
             all the time.

             I was working in Alaska when you were running for Governor and i heard you speak.

             With the two front runners for the office of the President                 and what is at stake most
             Republicans feel it is a repeat of Bob Dole and 1996.

             The Younger conservatives relate more to you than what we see everyday from the Media.

             They are Emailing McCain and Romney telling them they want you as a VP or they are
             leaving the party.

             This includes myself        if asked is there any way you would consider that office?

             Please just say yes ,      if i were asked      we would love to have a little hope out here.

             Like Reagan     only you could unite a fractured party.

             I heard you speak you shook my hand in a crowd I voted for you,and Leadership is in your
             blood i could see it.

             In Americas History people who never thought they had it in them had to step up and
             Govern or command for the good of the Nation.

             GOD blessed Alaska and this Nation with you as one of its Native Leaders.

             Your supporter David
                                                                     1
