               I am writing to express my disappointment in your leadership, or

          should I say misleading role in attempting to subvert the public

          initiative process regarding ballot initiative number four. Perhaps

          you need be reminded we still think we live in a democracy in which

          the people have the right to petition the government and effect public

          policy where appointed officials in the eyes of the citizenry either

          fail or prove inadequate. Your disregard for the public process and

          attempts to spread propaganda on behalf of foreign mining interests

          defy the better judgement of the Department of Natural Resources, the

          citizens of Alaska and all those working tirelessly to protect

          Alaska's greatest resource, clean water.           Remember, as a'public

          servant your interests should lie in serving the greatest good of the

          state.     Although you may not be immediately held accountable for your

          actions and professional failures you should understand it is

          behaviour such as yours which defy the public trust and degrade the

          credibility of your post and the Department of Natural Resources as a

          whole.     The reasons for ballot initiative four is directly and

          specifically related to the incompetence demonstrated by your

          department under your supervision. Officials like yourself must be

          held accountable for breaking Alaska Laws. I urge your immediate

          resignation. to demonstrate accountability within the Department of

          Natural Resources and to further indicate your error in judgement was

          not a flagrant abuse of power, that was knowingly in violation of

          Alaska Statutes and an assault on the public trust- You have

          compromised your credibility and integrity to act as Director of Large

                                                                1

               The double standard we face in so many areas is almost comical . Despite other governors who
               spoke out personally and even in their position as gov , I was told this morning that APOC says I

              Governor, attached below are Ed Fogeys quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right away. Ruth is
              already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to decide the right course of
              action.

               We still feel that DEC, Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


              To: Tom, Marty,

              The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several specific
              examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other election statutes, and
              a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the ballot measure should have some
              level of agreement to our website.

              The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website language that is
              mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that they find objectionable- We
              have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm tomorrow. the Commission will either
              then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

              The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state officials
              cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at 2:00. The
              Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.

             Let the other side have space on the website for rebuttal. And IT forgo my First Amendment rights until
             the critics chill and I can once again express my personal opinion when asked...

             Governor, attached below are Ed Fogeys quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right away. Ruth is
             already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to decide the right course of
             action.

             We still feel that DEC, Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


             To: Tom, Marty,

             The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair " manner, and cited several specific
             examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other election statutes, and
             a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the ballot measure should have some
             level of agreement to our website.

             The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website language that is
             mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that they find objectionable. We
             have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm tomorrow. the Commission will either
             then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

             The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state officials
             cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at 2:00. The
             Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.

             Ed

             You are correct he did speak openly about that subject and there were never any repercussions that I
             have ever heard about.
