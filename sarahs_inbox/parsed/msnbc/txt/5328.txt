               Governor - It may be helpful for someone from our gas team to be at the

               budget roll out press briefing today to be able to field questions on

               pipeline integrity - I did not want to discuss the AGIA fiscal

               notes/impacts today although I am certain there will be questions on

               that also.     Bitney will be at the press event also - KJR

               >1 sure don't like all the focus on incentives/tax breaks/changes in oil-gas tax rates,
               etc. I don't like that focus and we sure havnt concluded where we are on all those fiscal
               aspects.  Sure comes across as sounding just like murky's give aways - the same give
               aways the public said no, to...    So we need a more reasonable explanation of our
               intentions here with any and all tax considerations .



               >Also, we're still viewed as 'loosening up' slope oversight ever since AND headline last
               week -sen.murkowski even was pretty appalled by the intimation that we're not ramping up
               oversight ... We corrected her but she's still concerned . Pls look into hiring
               PrlVile a again for a position there. I don't want to mess around there and diminish public
               confidence in my commitment to beef up oversight .
