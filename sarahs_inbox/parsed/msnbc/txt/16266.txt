           I'm heading out to the Valley in 15 minutes to do a walk-through for the

           chamber event, but will work with Director Rehfeld on getting those

           numbers to you and in your briefing booklet.

          Karen/Kate: Can you get Mat-Su budget numbers together for my Wasilla

          Chamber speech tomorrow? I'll be asked what all we accomplished for

          their infrastucture needs in the budget.
