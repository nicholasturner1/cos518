           I don't think she's been able to hook up for the last few fridays, and the last 2 haven't
           been so neutral towards the Admin.

           It definitely has been helping that Sheila checks in with Sharon before printing. There
           are even worse things that would have ended up in there. Thank God, Sharon has a very good
           relationship with Sheila.

            True - amazing how that had been working though ... The Gov's office being the bad guys
           for the entire past year. " Duck and run " seemed to have been the mantra.

            A really good lesson from this should be:


        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I know there are necessary deviations from that and this is water under the bridge, but
           Tib's signature should ' ve been on the letter that he crafted.



            Sheila was supposed to be out of town and Sharon hasn't had her "friday ear" sessions
           with Sheila lately because of that. I think that was helping. Hopefully she can start
           that up this next week even if she is still outta town.

           nasty letter Sarah wrote to Lyda " ( she's refering to the letter Tibbles and Balash wrote
           to her on April 18 , I presume )? What was perceived as so nasty about it I wonder?



            I did ask the guys if they wanted to put their name on it when they presented it to me
           for my signature - of course they wouldn 't - but the last few communications from the guys
           to Lyda, with my signature , sure have been capitalized upon by Shelia . Guess this is a
           lesson that the letters could have been tweaked more - but any idea why Shelia perceives
           them as she has?
