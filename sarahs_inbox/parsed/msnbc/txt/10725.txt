               Governor, Mike,

               Pat and Tom were just discussing the Cabinet Meeting scheduled for next Friday, January
               4th, from 10am-noon. I wanted to let you know that this was the same date/timeframe we
               were hoping to use on the AGIA "completeness review" press conference. This roll-out must
               be sequenced as follows:

               9:00am - 9:45am - Briefing congressional delegation;

               9:45am - 10:30am - Phone calls to Legislative leadership and specific friendly legislators
               by one team; as well as phone calls to all Applicants by another team;

               11:00am - 12noon - Press Conference announcing results of AGIA' completeness review;

               No Later Than 12noon - Legal & Public Notices hand-delivered to the Anch Daily-News by
               their noon deadline. It is this public notice that allows us to make the AGIA'
               completeness review public and triggers the public review.   Legally these must be
               sequenced and this entire roll-out must occur before the Daily News noon deadline.
               Therefore, if this schedule cannot occur on the morning of January 4th, we need to have
               the AGIA' "completeness review" press conference delayed to January 7th, as we cannot be
               ready before the 4th.   Please advise how I should handle this as I have the team really
               "cranking" in order to make the 4th, and waiting till the 7th would provide them a bit of
               breathing room.

               Thanks, and if you want to talk, please call me at #317-4728.

              Marty
