        MESSAGE:

         I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Alaska Moving Arts Center (AMAC)
        www.alaskamovingartscenter.org .  We are a non-profit located in Eagle River, Alaska and
        this coming October will be our 20th anniversary. AMAC has been a self sustaining
        organization mostly due to the efforts of its executive director, Ms. Rebecca Hesser.   Ms.
        Hesser has worked on behalf of the Eagle River community without monetary compensation for
        the full twenty years.




                    Without Ms. Hesser and numerous other volunteers, AMAC would be unable to keep
        our class fees within reach of some of the less fortunate residence of our community and
        we would not be able to offer the sliding scale and scholarship programs we do.




                    On Oct. 6th we are having a celebration focusing on AMAC's                          achievements as
        an organization, and on Ms. Hesser 's contributions.



                                                                   1

                        I am would like to explore what part Governor Palin might be able to take in
         this effort.
