Hi Todd-



I got a call from a publicist in Montana who is trying to get an Iron Dog racer on the Tonight Show.
Apparently, he submitted tapes of this year's winners but they didn't have the personalities the
Tonight Show was looking for!?!



Anyway, he thought you would be an interesting guest because of your broken arm - your status as
first dude etc. etc.

I know this probably isn't your cup of tea - but I promised the guy I would ask you! ,
