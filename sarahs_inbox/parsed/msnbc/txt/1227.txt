MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your son! My son is 26 years old now. He is the light of our lives. He
has taught us so much. You will soon see that in your own family. Michael has worked at Chili's as a
dishwasher for over 7 years. I can't even imagine all that your son will do being born at this time in
history. Enjoy!!! Pat
