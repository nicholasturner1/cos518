                 Subject: Processing requirements

               I wanted to let you know that I have been doing some additional research and discovered that under federal law
               any foreign vessel that is granted an internal waters processing permit must have an international fisheries
               agreement in place. At this point Russia is the only country that would be eligible for a permit Allowing a foreign
               processor from any other country would require either a change in federal law or negotiation of a new
               international treaty.
               This may limit our options somewhat , although I do have a contact that has proposed bringing in Russian vessels.
