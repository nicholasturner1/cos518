  RGA Congratulates Governor Palin on Son's Birth
  Governor's Labor Began at RGA Conference in Texas



  Washington, DC - The Republican Governors Association congratulated Governor Palin on the birth of her fifth
  child and second son, Trig Paxson Van Palin. Trig was born early this morning in Alaska. Yesterday, Governor
  Palin was at an RGA Governors Energy Forum in Texas where her labor began.



  The Governor was the keynote speaker at the conference's lunch. Both mother and son are resting and doing well.



  "During her remarks, Governor Palin joked about Alaska being Texas' big sister and said that her husband Todd
  insisted on coming to the conference, in part, because her pregnancy was in its 8th month," said RGA Chairman
  Governor Rick Perry. "We would like to congratulate the Palin's on the newest member of their family and offer
  our regrets to Trig that he wasn't born a Texan."

  "Governor Palin has set a new standard for dedication to RGA and in her commitment to innovative energy policy,"
