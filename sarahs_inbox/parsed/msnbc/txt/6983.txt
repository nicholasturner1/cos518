            As per news articles published in the last few days in the ADN, leading officers in the
            Veco Corporation have been interfering with many of our Legislators and using them to
            manipulate the profits obtainable from our resources in favor of Veco and other Oil
            giants . The whole dirty mess is now in open view. Governor Palin, you are the
            Governor of this state. Please take the following action.
            1. Cancel the Veco Corporation' s business license.
            2. Watch for and do not allow the officers of the Veco corporation to reconstitute
            themselves under a new business name.
            3. Cancel the Anchorage Times business license. They dance the Veco Waltz.
            4. Cancel Oil and Gas lease agreements with Exxon.
            5. Confiscate all Exxon property here in Alaska in payment for the Valdez oil spill
            unpaid fine.
            6. Do not allow Exxon to participate in any way in the Gas pipeline deal.
            7. Do not allow BP to claim tax relief on the oil pipeline repairs. It should have
            maintained the line in good condition.
            8. Our laws did not protect us from BP's pipeline spill, the Valdez oil spill or from
            Exxon's refusal to pay the oil spill fine.
                   Dare we now risk the Pebble project? Your call or let Alaskans be the judge.
