                Governor:

               Joe, Lynn, and I will coordinate efforts on getting what assistance we can to Mayor Klawunder.

               For Mayor Cottle at 1:00 pm. I called the contact number for the Mayor, which was Kim Hutchinson, a lobbyist,
               and asked what subjects the mayor wanted to talk about. Kim said really broad issues, like municipal revenue
               sharing, PERS / TRS.
