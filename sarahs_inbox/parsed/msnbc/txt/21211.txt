        We just got off the phone w/Tim. It sounds like the safer option to ensure your arrival -
        rather than getting stuck - is the Northwest flight. The other flight would have
        connected in Chicago. I was just wanting to make sure that other options had been
        explored. Bob is going to get you a room in Anchorage. Likely at the Hilton but we'll send
        you an email once we know for sure.

       I found a flight at 3:50 pm on American Airlines that would get you in to Anchorage at
       11:12 p.m.  We'll look into this/availability. Bob is calling the NY troopers now.

        Original flt was just pushed back again so there ' s no way to make any connection . We have
        to take a different airline and may get in at 2AM. My main concern is missing any of the
        mtgs we've scheduled for tomorrow , inlc the Fairbanks town hall mtg. I may have to stay in
        Anchorage tonight if we dont lv the airport agter getting our luggage around 2:30 or 3AM.

        I'll let Linda know. I believe Bob is talking with the troopers in NY on new flight
        arrangements / solutions . Please let me know if I can do anything.

        They may need a new purchase of tickets be these fits are all messed up with weather. And
        i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pls let
        linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
        fairbanks.

        Your connection will be 30 minutes - enough time to make flight. If you change, not arrive
        til 2 am
