                   last year, beating analysts ' expectations of $0.41 per share . However,
                   earnings In the quarter included a $0 . 03 gain related to the sale of the
                   company's Texas-based compost business, Living Earth Technology Co.

                   million in the same period in 2006 . Driving these gains were primarily

                2. MORE COUNTIES CONSIDER FLOW CONTROL IN UPSTATE NEW
                   YORK
                  The upstate New York counties of Lewis and St. Lawrence are said to be
                  considering flow control as a means to guarantee coverage of the $21
                  million in debt held jointly on their Development Authority of the North
                  Country's landfill at Rodman. So far, Jefferson County, which is home to
                  the landfill and a joint owner, is not considering the measure. The
                  development authority itself lacks any municipal policing powers that
                  would enable them to enact flow control directly. The move comes in
                  response to recent action by the Supreme Court which reversed course on
                  its 1994 ruling by saying that governments can force haulers operating
                  within their jurisdictions to use their government-owned facility. The move
                  would essentially revive a preexisting 1992 flow control measure that had
                  been set aside after the 1994 decision. Flow control would do little to
                  change the status quo since most waste generated in the region ends up
                  at the DANC facility, hauled there by Casella Waste Systems which
                  currently holds a contract to collect waste in Lewis and St. Lawrence

                3. WASTE IMPORTED AND LANDFILLED IN MICHIGAN IS DOWN
                   BY 6%
                  The Michigan DEQ reported a decrease in the volume of waste sent to the
                  state's landfills of 6 percent. from last year. Part of which is attributable to
                  a 10 percent drop In the volume of waste originating out-of-state.
                  Imported waste plays a significant role since it accounts for 29 percent of
                  all landfllled waste in the state . 19 percent of all waste comes from
                  Canada alone. That volume has dropped in accordance with a deal made
                  in 2006 between Michigan Senators Levin and Stabenow and the province
                  of Ontario to voluntarily stop shipments from Toronto and surrounding
                  communities Into Michigan by 2010. At Its peak in 2003, Toronto shipped
                  142 truckloads of waste per day to Michigan. It now averages 80 truck
                  shipments per day.. . Read More >o

                 5. OAHU HAWAII REPORTS LOWER RECYCLING RATE
                   The Island of Oahu Hawaii reported that its recycling rate for 2006 fell to
                   31 percent from 41 percent In 2005 and 35 percent in 2004. The island
                   generated about 1.8 million tons last year of which just over 500 thousand
                   tons were diverted through recycling and reuse programs. Officials are
                   uncertain about the cause but speculate that a larger proportion of
                   construction and demolition wastes would result in a lower recycling rate
                   since these streams are more difficult to recycle. Last month, the island
                   announced plans to expand Its waste-to-energy plant and to ship more
                   waste to the mainland in order to preserve space at Its Waimanalo Gulch

                6. ECOLAB TO ACQUIRE PROVIDER OF ENERGY , WATER AND
                   EFFLUENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
                   Ecolab says it has agreed to acquire Ecovation, a Rochester, NY-based
                   provider of renewable energy technology and effluent management
                   systems for the food and beverage industry, for approximately $210
                   million. Ecolab will then sell approximately $40 million of long- term lease
                   receivables following the transaction . Ecovation's technology reduces plant
                   operation costs by capturing energy from plant waste . It also helps food
                   and beverage processors comply with regulatory requirements. "While an
                   emerging market , the potential for such complete plant solutions is
                   substantial , with the U.S. food and beverage market opportunity alone
                   exceeding $4 billion," according to Ecolab's chairman, president, and CEO
                   Douglas M. Baker, Jr. Ecovation reported 2007 sales of approximately $50
                   million, and is expected to post 2008 revenues of over $100 million.
                   Ecolab says the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings by up to $0.01 per
                   share this year, but will be accretive to earnings in 2009 and
