              I can certainly help with that if its the direction we decide to go. We can strategize at
              lpm when Kelly comes in. She'll have good insight here.

             We do need Comm to messahe that so Alaskans know we ' re still on it... Despite leggies
             giving me NOTHING on Friday when they were supposed to, then nothing again on Monday.
             We're going to be so behind , as they'd like to see, to convolute AGIA.




             I can talk to Karen today as she'll be in Anchorage and I'll be in for the Dr Greene mtg
             and Energy talks.



             We can't let this be a cluster . We all need copies of budget ( s) so at least internally we
             can start scouring it. We'll find out Thursday if Cabinet has does any work on it, as I
             assume COS has been "on it" with instructing them to do so.



             Kris- would you get cookies or something for Cab mtg . Gotta get them in a good mood. Pls
             get a special one for Joe S . We'll use him as our "he's doing it right " Commissioner and
             I'll ask him to share what he's going through w the union , his budget , his critics , etc...
             but how it's all good for the State, ultimately.
