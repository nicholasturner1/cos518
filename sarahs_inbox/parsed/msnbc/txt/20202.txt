          I just finished a meeting with Mike Barnhill tonight. Its late so long story short they
          will be discussing the strange email you received from the friendly prosecutor tomorrow at
          a 10:00 am meeting as well as possibly reaccessing legal game plan. I will fill you in
          tomorrow.



           Thank you for a very interesting and memorable day. Thanks for allowing me to
          participate.



           Mike
