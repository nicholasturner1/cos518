            MESSAGE:

            I wanted to congratulate you on the birth of your baby Trig. What a cute name! I just
            had to write you and thank you for your wonderful words and attitude on having a child
            with Down syndrome.  My son with Down syndrome is now 6 and we are thrilled with him.
            Its hard to find positive things being said about having children with Down syndrome and
            want to thank you for being willing to share.

            Congratulations and Thank you.

            Julie Rodgers
