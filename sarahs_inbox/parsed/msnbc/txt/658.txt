  Hi Todd,

 I looked through my records for First Spouse's outreach, and they don't show that Susan Knowles was
 involved with the Red Cross. I see that Mrs. Murkowski had worked with the Red Cross during their
 senate years; served as the Co-Chair and Chair of Alaska Red Cross Disaster Cabinet for about 2-
 3 years as the 1st Lady of AK; 2006 served as a member of the Benefit Committee for the Amer.Red
 Cross 125th Anniversary Gala in D.C.. So it's not a long standing tradition for First Spouse's to serve on
 the Red Cross.

 Since I keep archiving records for the First Spouses I called Kelly Hurd (contact for Red Cross) to get
 missing info for Mrs. M's archive records. She will send me what info. she has and since I do your
 archiving as well, I asked her to let me know what your role was as the Chair, etc... Apparently they have
 a new upper level staff person, so they're trying to get things squared away. I understand that Ivy is
 handling your involvement with the Red Cross, but just let me know if you need anything.

 Thanks-
 Erika
