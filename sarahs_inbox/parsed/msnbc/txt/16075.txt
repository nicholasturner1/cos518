            Hi,




            Promise all the Republican women in our country that you would accept to run for VP on the
            McCain ticket!!!  YOU are the kind of woman we want our daughters to look up to! Have 20
            and 30 year old daughters as well as a 4 year old grand-daughter!




            All the best wishes from Northern California! Someone told me about you and I had to
            check it out on-line! You are just great!!!




            Best regards,



            Marianne Gausman
