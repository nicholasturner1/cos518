          I read an article today about your new baby Trig. I'm so proud of you and your Husband!



          Psalm 127 (NIV)

          Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches
          over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late,
          toiling for food to eat for he grants sleep to those he loves. Sons are a heritage from
          the Lord, children a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born
          in one's youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to
          shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.



          God bless you Governor Sarah Palin and Todd Palin!

          Kelly
