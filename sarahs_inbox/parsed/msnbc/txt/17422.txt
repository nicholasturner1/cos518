             Subject: Mat-Su Miners

           Pete and Denise Christopher (managers of the Miners) called regarding the upcoming season . They are working
           on putting together a "Governor Palin Day at the Park" in June. They said Rep . Stoltze was working on
           organizing it, but thought we all should be in the loop . Also, there's a Miners baseball clinic for Valley kids that the
           Mat-Su Delegation usually sponsors . They haven't shown as much interest as years past . If Governor Palin is
           interested in sponsoring the clinic it could coincide with the "Governor Palin Day at the Park" game. The kids get
           shirts and other things that say something like "Mat-Su Miners Baseball Clinic sponsored by Governor Palin."

           If this is something we want to pursue I can pass the contact information on to Karl. Just let me know how (if at
           all) you want to proceed.

           Thanks,
