            Talis says Dyson is known for writing scathing reprimands to admin. He did the same thing
            to Murkowski's folks - but his Native Commission idea is still good. Just fyi.

            I received a copy of Dyson's letter here Monday. Let me know if you'd like me to scan and
            forward,



            gov.sarah@yahoo.com wrote: Sen. Dyson wrote a pretty scathing letter a week or so ago re:
            no progress on his Native Elders Roundtable idea, a year after presenting the idea to the
            Gov's office.



            Pis provide a copy of the letter to Rhonda, and others who need to see it. Dyson' s idea is
            great, but I had assigned the idea to jitney so he'd work with Dyson on it , and Bitney
            must not have communicated anything on this to Dyson.



            Between Rhonda, the Lt. Governor, and others who think this is a good idea, I'm sure we
            can see something come to fruition on Dyson's idea.



            Thanks



           Also- I need DPS letter from Aniak and their response to Aniak re: no troopers wanted in
           the village. Thanks
