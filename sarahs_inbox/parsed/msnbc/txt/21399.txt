             Hello Governor,




             I'm stuck in Ketchikan and won ' t make it back before 1:00pm.



             Susan will be there at 7:30am .    She'll keep the plumbers , etc downstairs until you leave
             or you give her the go ahead to let them go upstairs .    There ' s plenty for them to do
             downstairs , so there ' s no rush.




             The workers start their day at 7 : 30am , but that can be changed to 8:00 when you're at the
             House.



             Current projects :    plumbing replacement , windows        ( onging ...), and generator replacement
             ( begins today).



             Thank you,

             Erika
