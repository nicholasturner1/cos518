            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your son Trig!



            Have you heard about ReignDown USA? I have been trying to spread the word in Anchorage
            over the last few weeks, but no one, including the churches and KTUU TV seems to care
            about such an important event in our nation's history. It saddens me greatly. There is a
            national day of prayer, but this is different.



            On Saturday, April 26, beginning at 2 p.m. Alaska time, ReignDown will occur at the
            National Mall in Washington DC and will continue to the Capitol Building on Sunday, April
            27.   It is a day of repentance and prayer. There are many state venues for this event
            across our nation and a few international venues. Unfortunately, Alaska isn't one of
            them.   Several state governors have declared proclamations bout this important day. God
            TV will be broadcasting the event live on their Direct TV channel as well as webcasting it
            through their website, www.God.tv.



            ReignDownUSA's website is www.ReignDownUSA.com if you would like more information.



            Thank you for your time.
