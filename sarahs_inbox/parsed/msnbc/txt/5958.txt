            Governor, I had a good conversation with Kristan this morning. She is an excellent choice. I let
            her know DNR will support her and ultimately you to give the Dairy Farmers the best chance
            possible to be successful. She will provide recommendations for Ag director from the BAC as
            soon as possible, right after 7/6. I let her know that Doug Warner is acting Ag director right now
            and he is available to help on any issues. Also to call me if answers don't come quick enough,
            we don't have any time to waste. god bless Tom
