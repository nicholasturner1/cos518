           Now I hear he had to get back on the air and apologize for the misinformation? So says
           John Reeves. I didn't hear it.

          Of course it's not true! I love you guys and loyal to the end! We have much work left to
          do and we need to not get bogged down by tactics like this.

            Just read an email on the air supposedly from someone who claimed Anna was resigning...
           It was read as, "This is an announcement from Anna Kim that she is resigning..." according
           to the listener who just called Todd to tell him what Fagan read on the air.
