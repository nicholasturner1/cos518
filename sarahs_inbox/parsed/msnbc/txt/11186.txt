              Sharon: "This is nonsense. This was NEVER about acommodating "personal travel
              arrangements". Travel arrangements to my son's military graduation into the Infantry were
              made subsequent to Lyda's permission, given a month ago, to address Alaskans in the State
              of the State on the first day of the shortened session. She knows this. And this is an
              unfortunate indication that some would rather spend time and resources on things other
              than working together and progressing this state." .

              Sharon/Beth- lyda is saying this is so "the Governor can accommodate her personal travel
              schedule". Be strong and solid in response back on that- it's bull, she's again spinning
              this, and she must be called on this. Please

              Sheeeesh- lyda just changed it again to 4pm, even tho this may not be a "legal" sos
              because she says they won't convene until 6pm (AFTER the sos address) and you're supposed
              to present sos after they gavel in/convene.
