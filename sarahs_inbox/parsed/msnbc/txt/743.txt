Ms. Fagerstrom,



I am writing today to seek assistance from Todd Palin to aid us in our mission of safer AN riding for
young Alaskans. Alaska Trails, in partnership with the Bureau of Land Management and National
Park Service, is responsible for creating ATV safety training for young people in Alaska. Our vision is
to have Mr. Palin be a spokesman for responsible riding and wearing a helmet in a brief public
service announcement for TV and/or radio. Mr. Palin is seen as a champion and his positive image
could help us carry forth our mission and reach a wider audience.



Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.



Sincerely,



Jillian L. Morrissey

Executive Director, Alaska Trails
