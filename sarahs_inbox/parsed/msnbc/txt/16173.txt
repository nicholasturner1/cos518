              We will have a gift . Janice, since the Governor said from the beginning that she would
              only caddy - I would let them know that she will attend only and not golf . We'll find
              someone from office or Commissioner to fill - in on remaining time.

               I absolutely can't golf - and can't stay for a four - hour 18-hole event . I'll find someone
              to sub for me on the back nine holes . Do we have an international gift for these folks?

               Sorry to chime in on this late as things may have changed, but I thought the Governor was
              going to caddy or drive a golf cart.



               I would offer to be a partner but there are statehood events that day in Anchorage. That
              would have been fun (okay, not really as I completely suck at golf). Vic Fisher and Katie
              Hurley are tentatively scheduled to pin a star on the flag that day at noon.
