                Chuck Hamel has been calling nonstop to try and get an appointment with you while you are in DC. He says he
                has important FBI information about corruption at Prudhoe Bay that you need to know about . I have asked both
                Joe Balash and Meg Stapleton to call him. John Bitney recommends you do not talk to him directly , that one of
                your staff should. John wants somebody from the staff to find out what he's calling about so he doesn 't spring
                something on you . He knows you are in DC for NGA so he may try to run into you somewhere , he is very
                adamant about talking directly to you.

                 Dealing with NGA can be a frustrating experience, but I think we've made some progress today:
                 The NGA press release that I forwarded yesterday to the Governor and you describes a draft workplan for the
                 Natural Resources Committee to implement during the 110th Congress. As mentioned, the release did not include a
                 reference to oil and gas.
                 However, because of our previous advocacy, the workplan itself was amended slightly to include "Enhancing
                 America's energy independence by reducing U.S. consumption of transportation fuels and sustaining domestic
                 production in an environmentally responsible manner."
                 I said that we would prefer a specific mention of measures to sustain and enhance domestic production of oil and gas
                 in an environmentally sensitive manner. Committee staff is discussing this now, but thought that any reference to
                 enhancing production would be a problem given opposition to specific energy projects in certain states. I will hear
                 back soon on how far we can go at the staff level and will let you know.
                 It should be noted that we are dealing with the Committee's workplan, not new NGA policy. I have attached the
                 existing NGA policy for your ready reference. As you will note, Sections 18.4.1 and 18.4.2 express support for
                 measures to enhance the domestic production of oil and gas and even specifically mention the Alaska natural gas
                 pipeline (the highway route). It is unusual for NGA policy to support or oppose specific projects.
                 The energy policy is scheduled for reconsideration at the summer meeting of NGA. There may be an effort to
                 amend it on an interim basis but not at the upcoming winter meeting.
                 Even if the Governor misses the Monday meeting of the Natural Resources Committee, she will have the
                 opportunity to talk about oil and gas/the natural gas pipeline in one of the Governors' Only Sessions. I would
                 recommend that she make specific mention of her pipeline plans and the need, as an NGA priority, to enhance
                 environmentally responsible oil and gas development.
                 Given the foregoing, I don't think the Governor should be subject to any criticism. The existing NGA policy on oil
                 and gas remains in tact for now; hopefully, the workplan can be further amended; and she should have an
                 opportunity to talk with her colleagues about the gas pipeline and other energy issues.

                 John,

                 I am not that familiar with the NGA resolution process but it sure seems like we need some indication from the
                 resource committee that oil and gas or at least the gas pipine is important to the nation. Given the schedule conflicts
                 with the resource committee time it appears as if our only hope is to seek out certain Governors to share our views.
                 The Governor did receive an ivitation from WGA to meet with the Speaker but again it was at a time already filled,
                 Our priority is to meet with the companies and federal officials regarding AGIA; however, I am concerned that we
                 will get killed back home it we return from NGA without being successful at getting the Gov's colleagues to support
                 us.

                 P.S.
                 We've just been told that none of the large conference rooms in this building is available for the time we need . We could
                 reconfigure our conference room to squeeze in about 15 people. Otherwise, we will need to seek space elsewhere.



                 Since we have not yet caught up with each other, I have reserved a large conference room in this building for a possible
                 press conference.

                 This will give the Governor the flexibility to invite a larger group of media or to restrict participation to the Alaska/DC
                 stringers . If the latter, the small conference room in our office should be sufficient.

                 Please advise on which direction you want to go.
