           Subject: Kyle Hopkins / KABATA document




           Governor:



           I spoke'with Kyle.  He was able to get a copy of the document from KABATA in Anchorage.
           He is considering a follow up story in the next several days based on some of the
           statements in the document, such as estimated costs for the project, risks to the state,
           etc.



           I will work with DOT to try and set up a meeting with KABATA for them to brief us on their
           new approach to the project.




           Randy
