                State archives might be another option over in the State Office Bldg.

                Good idea- Janice, is this possible for an internet pic or Juneau Empire pic to be printed
                off for this?

               I wonder if your staff could arrange for a picture of the judge to be displayed in a
               noticeable but respectful manner for the Friday open house??



                Sandy and the girls join me on the 11:30 flight to Juneau this morning. The girls really
               look forward to seeing yours on Friday night.
