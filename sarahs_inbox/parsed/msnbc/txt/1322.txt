MESSAGE:

Hi (Auntie) Sarah,

      This is Kelli Wallona, Diana Palin-McLean's niece and I'm a

junior at Manokotak School. I'm staying here with Dana and Larry

Bartman. At school I would hear Dana talking to some of the seniors,

saying "don't worry about the small things first, find your class a good

speaker first." I know it's not for another year, but ever since people

here have been talking about having a good speaker at their graduation

and how it's important, I always wanted someone special, to make our

graduation memorable, and worth while. As I would think about speakers

you always came to my mind first, and I knew it would be perfect. So I

thought I'd ask and see if you would be able to be the speaker at our

graduation next year here at Manokotak. I know it's a lot to ask with

your busy schedule and brand new baby ( congratulations by the way) but

I thought I'd give it a try anyway even though you probably will be to

busy. Well thanks for your time and I hope you consider thinking about

it.



               Sincerely,

                      Kelli Wallona
