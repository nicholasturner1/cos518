              Today's schedule is going to be packed again, without much room for budget. Janice and
              Mike- pls let people know I can NOT spend much time in these other meetings away from the
              budget- remember I fly out tomm night and I'll be making the budget decisions today. We
              need to make the rounds asap with lawmakers to communicate the pending vetoes, I'd think
              Russ will have to tap into others to help him cover everyone today and tomorrow.



              Ltgov: I did get your emails.
