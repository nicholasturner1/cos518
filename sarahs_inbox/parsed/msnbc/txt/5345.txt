                   Subject: Mental Health Trust Nomination

                 Governor and Mike,
                 Jeff Jessee sent the MHTA nomination on February 22 (after the confirmation list was due to the Legislature).
                 I've included a memo with the nomination . If it's good , I'll prepare a letter and send it down to the speaker and
                 president they already know this was going to be late . I provided a hard copy of the memo and the resume to
                 Kari and Janice yesterday so it may in your piles of reading material.
                                                                                               Privileged or Personal Material Reda^
                 Also, when you guys have time, Local Boundary Commission is heating up.
               Privileged or Pe I'll explain why when I see you guys.
                 Thanks,
