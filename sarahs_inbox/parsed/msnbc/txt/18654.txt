              :)That certainly would be great!!

             Are you thinking as a celebration after the state championships (playoffs etc..) or just go ahead and plan something
             regardless? We have team dinners the Thursday nights before all of our home games, so that's an option or whenever is fine
             too!

             E- no doubt JDHS will win state football championships, so let's plan on having them to the mansion when its convenient for
             all, also!

             Goodmorning,

              That's strange-I just received this email dated Sep 7, (8:54AM), but it was delayed an entire day... Hopefully that wasn't the
             case w any of your other emails yesterday.

              Thanks so much for the invitation to your home for dinner. We were really looking forward to watching Bristol 's game and
             seeing you guys! By the time we got in and got a rental car it was already about 8 o'clock . AK Air and mechanicals-ugh!

             Kaitlin was sad/disappointed, she was especially looking forward to seeing Piper and Willow.

              The (ball team usually stays at the HS gyms, but they found a really cheap hotel in Palmer (Moose something..?) so they
             splurged.

             Hopefully we'll see the girls (maybe you too) at the game today!

               I'll be in the Anchorage office today so hollar if anything changes re: coming out to wasilla this evening - is the team staying
              in a wasilla hotel, or anchorage?

              It would be fun to go to Bristol's game tonight so we 'll do dinner very casual and then go up to the field.
