              If McCain's Campaign comes calling, I hope that you seriously              consider being his running
              mate. I have read a little about you and I like you very much              as VP already;
              qualifications, guts, implementations, etc. However, where do              you stand on the issue of
              Faith? Please put something on your website that would give a              CLEAR view of where you
              stand. Thank you.

             Dear Gov. Palin,



               My family and I visited your great state recently and the natural beauty is beyond
             description, as I'm sure you know. What we found equally refreshing and satisfying is the
             approachability and accessibility of government at all levels. We are Wisconsin residents
             and I can tell you that I have been to our Capital building several times and have worked
             with our senators, representatives and govenors on a variety of issues and have never had
             the welcome feeling that your capital building and staff afforded us. I talked with
             Christopher Clark while I was touring your capital and he was very willing and able to,
             take the time and effort to talk with me and give me a brief history lesson and bring me
             up to speed on state government in Alaska. Your state seems to have kept government at a
             more manageable level than most states and as a result has retained a more relevant and
             responsive leadership role than some of the more "proggressive" states. You have renewed
             my faith in peoples ability

             to self govern without government becoming so big and controlling as to become a bigger
             challenge than those issues it was designed to help manage. Great job and if there is
             anything that I can ever do to help you or your great state, please don't hesitate to
             contact me. Thanks again!
