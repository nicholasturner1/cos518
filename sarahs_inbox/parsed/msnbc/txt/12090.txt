           Governor-



           I just talked with Bob Lester.



           Bruce and Kurt are going to be on KWHL - in studio Thursday. Bob is also going to line up
           folks from Conoco to be there as well.

          Both Bruce and Kurt are making an AGIA presentation to large gathering of industry groups
          in D.C. today. If I don't hear back from them by three - I will call them.
