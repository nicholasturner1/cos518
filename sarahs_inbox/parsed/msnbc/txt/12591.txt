            With your extensive business experience, especially in Oil and Gas and your great
            negotiation skills, I think you would be a great presidential candidate! Your views /
            ethics / and record stands by it's self. ... You should give it some serious
            consideration, I and many others would be behind you.



            May God Bless you and your family.
