               and ConocoPhillips representatives that will be attending your Cook Inlet LNG Agreement'
               press conference at noon on Thursday, January 3rd. They are:

               Mr, Steve Hinchman, Senior Vice-President Worldwide Production (Houston)

               Mr. Pat Kuntz, Vice-President Natural Gas & Crude oil Sales (Houston)

               Mr. David (Dave) Risser, Natural Gas Marketing Manager (Houston)

               Mr. Doug Thierwechter, Governmental Affairs Manager (Houston)

                                                                                                                  PRA_GSP01_0009133

               Mr. Jim Taylor, Vice President of Commercial Assets          (Prudhoe, TAPS & Cook Inlet)
               (Anchorage)

               Mr. Scott Jepson,    Manager ,   Cook Inlet Business Unit (Anchorage)

               Mr. Roger Belman ,   Legal Counsel (Anchorage) *

               Mr. Michael Hurley, Governmental Affairs Manager (Anchorage)

               Ms. Natalie Knox, Community Affairs (Anchorage)



               * = Part of Negotiating Team for the Cook Inlet LNG Agreement



               We are working on talking points , questions & answers , and a one - page overview of the
               Agreement .   We hope to have these materials to you , Mike , Joe and Beth , by Monday. I have
               also invited the state negotiating team to attend the press conference and that includes
               the following individuals : Nan Thompson ( Unit Mgr , Division of Oil & Gas ), Kevin Banks
               (Director , Division of Oil & Gas ), Craig Tillery ( Deputy Attorney General, Civil
               Division , Dept of Law ), and myself.




               Finally , I believe that Eugene ( Gene ) Dubay , Senior Vice President of Operations/Semco
               Energy ( parent company of Enstar ) is also planning to attend the press conference and
               would be willing to say some words of support .     I will speak with him before Monday
               regarding what he might like to add.




               Beth , Is there anything further we need to do to help you and the Governor prepare for the
               Press Conference?



                Thanks , everyone , for your support,

               Marty
