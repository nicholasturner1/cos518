          I am a leader of Troop 120. I have Brownies and Jr. Girl Scouts in my troop. I would
          like to have you come and speak with my troop and the other Girl Scouts in our community.
          I think having someone like you as a role model would be wonderful. We are building
          leaders.




          I start my monthly meetings in September through May, from 6:00 p.m. - 7:30 p.m. I would
          love to set up a time when you are in town to please come and speak with our Girl Scouts
          in our community.



          We look forward meeting you. Thanks for your time.



          Sincerely yours,




         Ronda Benish Shepard
