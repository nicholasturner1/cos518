             Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 28th, 2008




             Dear All:



             The Community of Nikolski has an estimated 500 gallons of #1 heating oil

             left.      They are completely out of #2 heating oil. This is enough #1 to

             run the power plant for another three or four days. Currently several of

             the buildings within the village, including the community building,

             lodge, and tribal office are completely out of fuel.



             The Delta Western barge is scheduled to head to the Pribilofs in a

             couple days and be there for a couple of weeks. Nikolski may be

             scheduled after that effort.



             For this reason ,   another emergency fuel delivery and a long-term

             emergency fuel plan is desperately needed . The only method currently

             available is by air charter .       This is not only the most expensive method

            but also provides very limited amounts of fuel.



            The Coast Guard will not allow any further by-sea fuel deliveries,

            unless the State of Alaska declares an emergency. APIA and the Nikolski

             IRA request guidance from the State of Alaska regarding how the State of

            Alaska defines "an emergency" and how an emergency declaration may be


                                                                    1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP0I_0010858

               applied in this instance.



               Fuel delivered by air charter costs the community and individuals on

               fixed incomes $ 10.50 to 10 . 87 per gallon . Fuel delivered by sea costs

               considerably less and provides the opportunity for greater volume.           An

               equally serious problem is the lack of funding to pay for the continued

               emergency deliveries which will be needed .    Nikolski has submitted their

              paperwork for the State of Alaska's Community Energy Assistance Program.




              The Nikolski IRA is currently holding a Community Meeting to discuss the

              situation and assess what other resources could be applied to pay for

              emergency fuel delivery.



              A new update will follow upon new information . Please let me know if you

              need any more information.
