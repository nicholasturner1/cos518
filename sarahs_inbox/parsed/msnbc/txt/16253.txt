              Deb:

              Please let your DP person know that the Governor is waiting for LAW to complete its work today and that
              completion of that bill drafting assignment depends on LAWs DP person getting the system back up and running
              so you can produce the bill today.

              Also, if you have a hard copy of the most recent draft and know the changes that need to be made, please have a
              secretary start retyping the bill in a new word doc. As I recall, the bill Fp-rivwleaed or personal Material Reda
              Privileged or Pe should not be more than 3-4 pages.

              We are having a problem with the primary file server this morning.

              At this time I do not have an ETR (Estimated Time of Resurrection)

              Will update as information becomes available.
