              I still get mixed msgs then on who pays for what. Remember the mess with the student
              athletes who wanted to visit - I received the very strong msg that the state did NOT pay
              for hosting (most) receptions or folks would abuse the house usage as just another free
              venue for their event. (Remeber that's why we used old food, volunteer moms, and donated
              brownie mix for the teams).   It's also why Todd and I have been so hesitant to ever
              invite anyone over - the rules are murky and I'm not going to risk breaking any unwritten
              rules because things get leaked and misconstrued. So... I need more definitive rules to
              follow when it comes to hosting, inviting and feeding guests in the Gov's house. I'm Ic-
              ing Mike(s) so they'll, too, know it's been a year of mixed messages re: what I can and
              can't do in the house. Thanks

             It would be paid for by the House.

              Governor,



              Usually events are approved that the Governor or First Gentleman host- then if either of
              you can't attend, we can ask for the Lt. Governor or a Commissioner to host the event. if
              you want to approve this request and the Lt. Governor or a Commissioner hosts it that's
              perfectly fine from the aspect of House protocol. I think the idea is that it limits
              groups from thinking of the House as just another venue. Hope that answers your question.



              Thanks,

              Erika

              Is this an unusual request- hosting event(s) there when I'm not there? Can't think of when
              I've heard it done in the past.



              And who pays for the Tongass group's reception?

              Governor -



             I know that you will be in New York during the requested date of Wed., 02.27.08. Joe has
             asked if it would be okay with you to go ahead and host the Tongass Futures Roundtable
             Reception at the House that evening. It will be staffed by Joe Balash and the Lt.
             Governor.  This was the request for approx. 35 attendees. Thanks, Janice
