            We'll ask our GT contacts for more information. It's something we'll have to keep a close
            eye on as it develops.



            On the surface, it appears that it is merely collateral damage from their past association
            with Abramoff.  We knew of the Abramoff connection, but GT has moved past that episode.
            GT is a huge firm, voted #1 in the US last year by the ABA.



            There is no indication that this should color the stature GT holds in the gas pipeline
            regulation arena , but we have to be careful with perceptions.
