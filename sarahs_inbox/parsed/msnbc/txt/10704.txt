               Dear Governor Palin:




               Hi Governor,

               I am glad we have a good govenor as yourself to bring your state back in

               line concerning morals . It takes a good person to bring this subject back

               to the mainstream .    I have learned over the years that money talks even

               when it is unlawful to take bribes and kickbacks. Anyone from your state

               should be very happy to have such an outstanding leader ,       family values,

               and work ethics as you do . Wow, our state even locked the Speaker of the

               House up for bribes , etc. (North Carolina .) Wishing you all the blessings

               god can give . Come on and run in N.C.



               Sincerely,




               Sam Bagley   ( US Army ret.)
