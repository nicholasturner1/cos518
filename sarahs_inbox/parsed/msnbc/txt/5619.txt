            Thank you John. It will be an interesting Committee hearing. This announcement of HCEC was
            big news up here yesterday.

              I thought that you would be interested in the attached exchange of correspondence
              between Bob Malone of BP and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce
              concerning pipeline corrosion on the North Slope and related matters . These issues were
              the subject on an article in today's ADN.

              At BP's request, the hearing scheduled for May 3rd has been postponed to give the
              company more time to respond to Committee questions. Jonne Slemons was poised to
              testify for the State.
