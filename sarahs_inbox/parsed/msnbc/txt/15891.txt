           MESSAGE:




           Dear Sarah,



           I received an interesting phone call Saturday May 31 6:33pm from one of your underling,
           but also at a high level being your assistant. That is your girl, Ivy Fry. To remind you
           again, I am a private citizen and I can say anything I want about you or any other
           incompetent around you. I don't lie Sarah! Ivy didn't call me to discuss the many issues
           that Alaska is facing with your lack of leadership. I am sure she called to intimidate me
           in some way. However, she did not succeed. This is the 3rd attempt to contact you about
           this situation since Sat. concerning Ivy Fry's inappropriate behavior.

           Question ? Was she encouraged by someone to attempt this tactic , or did she do it on her
           own? Please reply with an appropriate answer and with the reassurance that I will not be
           getting anymore calls from young Ivy Fry.



           Your administration is full of inappropriate behavior of government employees. Point in
           question-How ethical are you and your administration? It is clear and transparent that it
           is Not.




           Sincerely,



           Mrs. Sherry Whitstine
