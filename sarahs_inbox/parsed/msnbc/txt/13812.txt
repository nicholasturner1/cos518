                 Governor,

                 We're finalizing a draft press release today that can go out either tomorrow or Friday with the
                 AGIA schedule.

                 Thank you Marty.
                 Are we estimating a timeline yet on announcing DNR finding?
                 And Tibbles was stopped again today by McAllister asking about AGIA timing... just fyi... he (and other
                 reporters) will be attending one of my legislative budget meetings this afternoon so he'll be asking me
                 again about timing of special session and he'll want me to answer his "what's up with AGIA" standard
                 questions.

                  I am forwarding this exchange between Robert Dillon and Cammy Taylor (DNR's Oil & Gas Division) just so you
                  know the correct information. The Wesley Loy' article in today's Anch Daily News inaccurately stated that
                  ExxonMobil's proposal was filed with the Superior Crt. It was simply filed with DNR as part of the PTU Remand
                  Hearing.

                  Robert,

                  Attached is the "Post Hearing Brief of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc, Chevron USA Inc.,
                  and ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc." and a "[Proposed] Agreed Final Judgment and Order" filed with the DNR
                  Commissioner Friday 3/21. These documents were filed for the Commissioner's consideration only. They were not
                  filed with the Superior Court.

                  If you need any additional information you can reach me at canuny.taylor@alaska.gov or 907-269-8817. --Caminy

                  Marty,

                  Can we talk sometime this morning about what 's happening in the Point Thomson case? Wesley's story wasn't
                  exactly clear on where things are. So Exxon has gone outside the admin hearing process and asked the state superior
                  court to approve its plan? Are any of these docs online?

                 . Sincerely,

                  RA. Dillon
