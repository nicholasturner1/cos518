         MESSAGE:

         I encourage you to actively pursue the VP opening with Senator McCain. I believe you bring
         executive experience to the table that both he and Senator Obama lack. I further believe
         it would position you perfectly for the following presidential election. Your being on the
         ticket would attract tremendous crossover pro-Hillary demo voters nationwide. Even if the
         combined ticket bid were to fail the campaign would provide you with exposure and name
         recognition for future opportunities. I'm an Oregonian raised in Ohio - I understand the
         psychology of both those states well and encourage you to aggressively pursue this chance
         to provide our country strong, decisive, articulate leadership. Thanks for your
         consideration!
