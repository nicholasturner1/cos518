  Subject: Interior Delegation Gasline Priorities

  Hello Everyone,

  Thought I'd share the following Information-



  FYI - The Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce asked the interior delegation
  members to give them their "TOP 5 most important elements in a gasline
  proposal"



  Here are their responses:


  Rep. Kelly


    1. Expandability
    2. Off-take points
    3. Access to the pipe
    4. Fair share of Revenues
    5. Provisions for gasline to South Central




  Rep. Ramras


    1. An open process allowing for specific criteria, but also allowing for a
       more "free form" proposal
    2. A revolving loan fund so communities can develop infrastructure to
       nominate gas into non-gasified communities
    3. Minimal tariffs and maximum capacity
    4. Tight timelines to lend to FERC certification
    5. The House Oil and Gas version of AGIA




  Sen. Therriault


    1. A system that encourages competition and exploration
    2. Rolled-in tariffs to encourage expansions
    3. Access to gas for in-state use
    4. Maximum employment of Alaska workers allowed by the Constitution
    5. Earliest date of operation




  Sen. Wilken

    1. A gasline is built


                                                                                                                                                  ROSTON 00184

    2. Maximum total benefit to Alaskans
    3. Rolled in expansion for future explorers
    4. Alaska takeout points
    5. Maximum AK hire during construction and ongoing operations




  Rep. Kawasaki and Sen. Thomas hadn't responded yet.


  Be the change you want to see in the world!
