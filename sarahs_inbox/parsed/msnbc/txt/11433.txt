              Inquiring minds want to know........



              What made Global Warming in Alaska , move faster than we thought?

              Must be because our Governor ' s so HOT.



              Can't wait to read the Feb. issue of Ak. Magazine. I'll have to go to the

              library, I just can't bring myself to pay for an issue. Are the T-shirts

              being sold around "The Valley" authorized by the Governor?
