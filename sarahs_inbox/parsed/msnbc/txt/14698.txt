             Pis do not pick up the computer until it is convenient for me to be without one. Is there
             any other way to check who logged on under "VISITOR" at 10:02pm last night?

             Right.   I was just in the process of responding back to you. ETS is already checking
             whether your computer could have been hacked into from someone outside of the network.
             However, to discover whether anyone has attempted to access your computer, one of our
             Security ETS technicians will have to pick up the machine. Dan Wolf will need to take the
             machine to our Tudor Road facility to do forensics on it to determine if someone
             unauthorized attempted to access the machine. You would be without the machine for 2-3
             days.  We also will need Kami Clark to provide Dan Wolf with the Novell logs for the
             machine.   Mike, I will send her an email message and copy you on the request.

                                                                     1

             When would it be convenient for Dan to pick up the machine?

             Annette- I'm not quite clear on what you're asking- were you told that someone appears to
             have logged on to my computer - I need to know who because no one is authorized to do so.

              I understand through Wyatt-Kevin Brooks-Mike Nizich that you want to be sure no
              unauthorized person signed onto your computer in your Anchorage office.




             Because of the protocols you and I discussed for viewing anyone else's computer (let alone
             the Governor's) I need to confirm with you that this is your request. Once I hear from
             you, I'll request it be looked at with unauthorized or attempted unauthorized use the
             focus of the investigation.
