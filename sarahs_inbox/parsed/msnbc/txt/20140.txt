           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           I first saw you on the rush limbaugh site. One of my employees is from the matsu valley
           and her mother was one of your teacher-the Tolsons. As I have followed your family and
           efforts on the news and this site, I want to say that I admire you and your husband for
           the love you have shown for your youngest child, for the value of all life, and for the
           strong conservative message and commitments to the state of alaska. Maybe I will visit or
           move there one day! Keep it up!




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0022444
