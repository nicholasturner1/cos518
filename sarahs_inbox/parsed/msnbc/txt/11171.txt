             Thank GOD it's over! What a crazy couple of days - thanks for getting us through them!
             Sharon says these were the busiest days of her career - I believe it.

             Hallelujah, it's over!  Nice job governor.   You appeared cool, calm and confident. A
             great message that I know resonated well with Alaskans.



             Now, go and have a good time with your family, enjoy the warm weather, and honor your
             son-you deserve it!
