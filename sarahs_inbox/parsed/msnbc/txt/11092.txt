              Erika- we just landed. I need to get on my pc to work on and print state of state speech,
              but looks like my computer was moved or something changed... it won't turn on. I'll either
              need it asap, or will need to get on your computer downstairs.    ???

              Thanks

             Governor,



             It took over five hours, but we managed to drop nearly 600 words, from 3,065 to the
             attached draft at 2,470! We also tried to clarify and improve flow. To tighten, we had
             to edit your words, hopefully we didn't lose many of your favorite turns of phrase. We
             embedded some comments to explain some thought processes , but toward the end just forged
             forward in the interest of time.



             We also confirmed all but one figure, noted in a comment. Sean will see to that one.



             Anyway, indulge us by opening the "clean" version first? The markup is also attached, for
             rejecting changes you dislike.  Let us know if there is anything else you need.



             Bruce
