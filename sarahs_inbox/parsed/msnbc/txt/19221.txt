                The pageant is July 19th . They were talking about waiting for Molly to get back or use a scanned version of what
                is in the book for the photo , and I told Kate to proceed without . We're fine for the DVD though ; it will be a 45
                second script and will be scheduled for Monday sometime while Jason and Andy are here for the press conf.
                We'll allow for enough time.
