              Governor, Kris,

               This press event is the Cook Inlet LNG settlement announcement. CP, Marathon and Enstar
              all wanted to bring people up to Alaska for the roll-out and that was difficult to
              accomplish by January 2nd, so they asked for the one extra day.

                Thanks and Merry Christmas!

               Marty

                Marty just called and there was a conflict with doing the press event on January 2nd as
               she discussed with you.  So we 've tentatively scheduled for noon on the 3rd. Please let
               me know if there are any problems with that date. I'll let Janice know.




                Thanks,



                Kris
