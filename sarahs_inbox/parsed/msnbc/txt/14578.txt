                  We do need Comm to messahe that so Alaskans know we're still on it...

                  Despite leggies giving me NOTHING on Friday when they were supposed to, then

                  nothing again on Monday. We're going to be so behind, as they ' d like to

                  see, to convolute AGIA.




                  I can talk to Karen today as she 'll be in Anchorage and I'll be in for

                  the Dr Greene mtg and Energy talks.




                  We can't let this be a cluster .          We all need copies of budget ( s)    so at least

                  internally we can start scouring it. We'll find out Thursday if Cabinet has

                  does any work on it, as I assume COS has been              " on it* with

                  instructing them to do so.




                  Kris- would you get cookies or something for Cab mtg. Gotta get them in a goc

                  mood. Pls get a special one for Joe S. We'll use him as our "he's

                  doing it right" Commissioner and I'll ask him to share what he's

                  going through w the union, his budget, his critics, etc... but how it's all

                  good for the State, ultimately.
