              Governor, All,
              The Port Authority purchased some type of option on the Yukon Pacific Corp' (YPC) assets. YPC had a 1989
              export license out of Valdez. However, there is NO WAY that DOE would allow that ancient license to proceed
              without undergoing another complete review and, in all probability it would not be approved. That is what DOE is
              saying - they will not allow the old license to be used without a review and when they review the old license they
              won't approve it.

              Furthermore, even if DOE would approve it, Congress would pass an export ban on Alaska gas. This is what Senator
              Stevens told the Alaska Legislature and Alaska press this week in Juneau. Specifically, Stevens referred to US Rep
              Pelosi's announcement this week indicating the Democrats are considering an energy bill that would include an
              export ban on Alaska oil.

              Marty

             According to DOE there will NOT be amd there IS no export license! Correct me if I'm wrong, tomfmarty... But
             that's what Slutz told me yesterday even. We need to get the word out on that one,,, also that today's Congress is also
             saying no license.

              okay bad comparison.

              anyhoo...i'm checking on that line about the export license in this ad. didn't think that was accurate.

              at least they're getting the "columns" right finally.
