               Governor,

               Here are your remarks and event info. I'm still waiting on feedback for the remarks from severa l in your Juneau
               office, so there may be changes yet, as Janice may have mentioned . I've told them I need to get the remarks to
               you as early this evening as possible . I've reworked the remarks , integrating several comments from Rhonda
               McBride. I will have Tara print your speech off on cards for you tomorrow morning , as I have jury duty first thing.
               Yay for civic responsibility© Anyway , I'll get updated remarks to you ASAP, and please do not hesitate to let me
               know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

               Thank you!

               P.S. Senator Inouye 's (HI) last name is pronounced "ih-no-way.'
