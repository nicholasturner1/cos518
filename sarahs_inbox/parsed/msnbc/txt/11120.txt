                 Governor,

                 It took over five hours , but we managed to drop nearly 600 words , from 3 , 065 to the attached draft at
                 2,4701 We also tried to clarify and improve flow. To tighten, we had to edit your words , hopefully we
                 didn't lose many of your favorite turns of phrase . We embedded some comments to explain some
                 thought processes, but toward the end just forged forward in the interest of time.

                 We also confirmed all but one figure, noted in a comment . Sean will see to that one.

                 Anyway , indulge us by opening the "clean" version first? The markup is also attached , for rejecting
                 changes you dislike . Let us know if there is anything else you need.

                 Bruce

                 When you get it, please don't read the red lined version first-just the clean version. (You'll get two
                 versions, one showing the changes and the other a clean version.) We're between 2400-2500 words and
                 both of us think it is a much tighter, clearer speech, that sounds like you!

                 Have a safe trip . I'll be there Monday.
