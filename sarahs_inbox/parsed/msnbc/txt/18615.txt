                 Dear Ms. Nymeyer:

                       Thank you for contacting Governor Palin with your thoughts on the statewide
                correspondence programs and the selection of the new commissioner of education.

                        With the current makeup of the Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development
                (board), I am sure that the interview process for the new commissioner will include discussion
                of home school, correspondence, and all elements of our education system. As you may have
                heard, the board decided to extend its search for a new commissioner. Barbara Thompson, the
                current deputy commissioner, has been named the interim commissioner.

                       As you know, Governor Palin, as well as the board, is supportive of educational choice.
                The board has made two attempts to address the statewide correspondence concerns through
                the regulatory process. The last time was in 2004. The board now believes that if any further
                changes need to be made to the equity issue, a legislative solution is needed.

                        At their last meeting, the board elected a new chairperson, Esther Cox. As the new
                chair, she will be addressing the outstanding issues related to statewide correspondence
                programs.

                       Again, thank you for taking the time to contact Governor Palin with your thoughts
                about Alaska's education system.

                                                           Sincerely,


                                                            J-   ly-V ti


                                                           Lynne Smith
                                                           Special Staff Assistant to Governor Palin

               cc:      Roger Sampson, Commissioner, Department of Education and Early Development
