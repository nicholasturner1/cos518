            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,

            I want to thank you for the time and effort you took to personalize and provide a
            photograph, upon my departure from State service.



            It has been my honor and pleasure to lead the Petroleum Systems Integrity Office (PSIO) in
            its formative year. I know we agree that the PSIO is critically important to the
            continuing, responsible development of our oil and gas resources.



            If I can ever be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to call.



            Sincerely,



            Jonne Slemons
