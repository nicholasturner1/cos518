              Governor Palin:



             Dear Palin,




                I would like to express my opinion. I read in our newspaper a few weeks

             ago that they where going to ask the State government, to help out when

             our town leaders got our town into debt when going after a prison to go

             out on Fort Greely.     Please refuse it we have to pay for our own mistakes.



             Thank You

             Rena Johnson



             Sincerely,




             Rena Johnson
