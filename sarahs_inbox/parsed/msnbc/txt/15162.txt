           Ok- and I'll need it arranged anyway, regardless of leggies availability (I had been
           assuming they were good to go with this at 1 today) because the energy team needs to meet
           on it anyway and update me on thursday's roll-out. Thanks

              Governor - This just came in as a scheduling request. I have attached the

             original signed letter.       Janice



              05.09.08



              We are writing to request that you meet with us in person about the energy

             crisis affecting our home and neighbors, as well as our whole state. Today

             we received a letter from General Campbell, but it does not cover all our

             concerns and we feel it is still critical to discuss these issues with you

             personally.



              The community of Juneau faces a steep increase in our electricity costs due

             to losing 1.5 miles of line and several transmission towers from our

             hydroelectric power plant at Snettisham. It has been estimated that our

             electricity costs will be increased by 500% for one month and 350% for two

             additional months.



              The economic impact this will have on our residents, small businesses, and

            nonprofit organizations is huge.        A small business that normally has a $1,000

             electric bill will have $9,000 in additional costs that were not budgeted,

             and a household which normally has a $100 electric bill during the spring

            months will have $900 in additional costs. Very few businesses and

            households have the money available to fill that gap.



              Our offices have been contacted by cozens of citizens and businesses who are

            deeply concerned about their ability to survive the increase. In addition,

            we are incredibly concerned about our local school district, which estimates

            its additional energy costs to be in the neighborhood of $400,000, money we

                                                              6




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0017658

            are sure everyone would rather see spent on textbooks        and teachers.



             While we have not seen these increases yet, the entire community is poised

            on the edge and we are readying ourselves for this hit. We know the impact

            will be devastating.      We expect the three-month crises will extract $18-20

            million from Juneau's economy in direct costs alone.



             We are very aware of the energy crisis facing all of Alaska. We want to be

            part of the solution, and we think we have worthwhile ideas that will lead us

            forward.    We hope that you will bee with us so that together we can work to

            help not only Juneau, but our whole state.



             Sincerely, Senator Kim Elton, Representative Beth Kerttula, Representative

            Andrea Doll
