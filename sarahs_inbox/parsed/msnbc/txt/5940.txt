         Still @ mtg. Going well. Kristan is running it extremely well. The members elected her
         chair and vanderweele vice. They removed the creamery board and appointed themselves.
         Following BAC, they called a creamery bd mtg. Kristan is chair of the corp too and don is
         vice. They've motioned to reverse the closure and it is currently under discussion. Van
         Treeck is here. Ill elaborate further, in person, on dynamics. Great board!
