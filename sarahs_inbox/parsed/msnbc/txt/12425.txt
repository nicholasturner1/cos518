           NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams is interested in a one-on-one interview with you
           about Exxon Valdez.

           I suggested right after tomorrow ' s Exxon Valdez news conference.



           It would be 10- 15 minutes.



           If you would like to do this,        Sharon can give the producer a call and make the
           arrangements.
