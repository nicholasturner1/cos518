            Maybe you've already seen, but these were just sent to me by a very reliable source...
            Don't know the pollster tho:



            Menard 50.7

            Green 25.2




            Stevens 47.0

            Begich 51.0




            Parnell 54.7

            Young 25.5




            That Stevens one makes me nervous...
