              What is your prediction ? Should I hustle on trying to return before my scheduled rtn?

             They were told not to leave or to come back .               I assume they will be flooding back to
             juneau this afternoon.

              Are all the lawmakers back in Juneau now, anticipating floor action ? Or when do they
             trickle back in?

               The house has the bill on the floor schedule tonight.      However , that will be subject to
              the pace of the finance committee work this afternoon .     Its possible the committee will
              drag on into the night.



                In either case , any floor action tonight will be procedural only. It is most likely
              that any amendments or votes would take place Sunday.

                I'm hearing the bill may actually get to the floor tonight? Should I try to get back
              there asap?
