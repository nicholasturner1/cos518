                Subject: Message from the Governor
                Many of you have already heard that Mike Tibbles has resigned his position as Chief of Staff. His last day
                is tomorrow, May 2nd. I wanted to also let you know that Mike Nizich will be Acting Chief of Staff until a
                replacement is found.

                I would like to once again thank Mike for his hard work and dedication; wishing him the best in his future
                endeavors.


               -Governor Sarah Patin
