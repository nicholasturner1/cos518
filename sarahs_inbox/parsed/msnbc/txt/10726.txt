              Governor,  I sent an email to all DNR employees. I received more responses than I
              imagined.  Many were similar to this one. I also heard from many asking me to thank you
              for treating them with such respect to give them Christmas eve off. Great decision. We
              are sure getting a lot of prayer support. Really special!
