            I would suggest that he work with local legislators to see if they would introduce such
            legislation.  Lynne, can you check with Lynne and see what she knows about this?



            Thanks,

            Sunny

           Would you consider sponsoring legislation that would provide debt forgiveness for state
           college loans for military personnel who have served in the front lines in Iraq? Our son
           has served 2 tours in Iraq . He carries a substantial state college loan debt.



           Thank you,

                 Governor, All,
                 I am attaching a copy of the State's DOE' Pleading and final Settlement Agreement for your information. I
                 do NOT recommend you bother reading this document, but in case you wanted to review it, I thought it
                 best to send it to you as well. My previous e-mail, sent around 8:30pm tonight, included the Agreement'
                 Executive Summary, which is a much more useful document to read. Please note that I have 50 copies
                 of the final, executed Agreement, and associated Executive Summary, for the Press Conference. I do not
                 intend to make available the DOE' Pleading.
                 Thanks,
                 Marty

                 questions or concerns. It is our intent to not only refer DOE staff to the website when we contact them
