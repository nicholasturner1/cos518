        Hello Governor and Kari,



        This was sent to me, and I'm not sure how to proceed. Please advise, if you'd like to
        deal directly with Pastor Rose in regards to this request or through me. I'm not involved
        with the coordinating of this event- like I was for the Prayer Lunch, but am willing to
        help coordinate this on behalf of the Governor, if this is something you are interested in
        pursuing.



        It seems like it would be personal not state business , so if that' s the case and you'd
        like me to follow-up on a personal /faith level-just let me know. I'd be happy to do
        whatever. J



        Thank you,



        Erika




        Hi Erika,




        I would like to offer an invitation for Gov. Palin to share an opening greeting to people

        Internationally known Pastor Dr. John Hagee.   This inspiring service will focus on
        Christians uniting together to help Israel.   The service will last until 3:30p.m.

                                                                1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0001446

         world is substantial.
