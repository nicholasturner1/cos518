         John: i was asked yest by reporters what percentage (budget cuts) we're aiming for -
         didn't have a specific number but declared we would be vetoing. It occurred to me we need
         to enlist the help of legislators, esp those who came out of the session screaming that
         their colleagues spent too much money.

        We'll give them the opportunity to help the state.



        Would you figure out how to reach out to them in requesting their ideas on cuts - some
        line items are in districts where the local legislator did not even request the item, it
        appears. They need to give input on where we can afford to cut, delay funding, or phase in
        funding. We need to do this asap.



        Perhaps a letter from the third floor giving them a head's up reminder that we must live
        within our means and a strong request to tell us how they can help.



        I know it's probably never been done before, but so be it. But it's got to be done soon.



        Also, I' m very anxious to hear from Cabinet members their suggestions for cuts , too. Mike
        - would you forward this to commissioners as the reminder that we need their input asap.



        Thanks!
