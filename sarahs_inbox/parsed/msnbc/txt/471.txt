Subject: Construction at Mansion and Governors Office at Capital



Governor and Todd: If we schedule window replacement at the Mansion and new ceiling/asbestos
removal in the Juneau Governor's Office, it would be best to schedule the Patin Family out of Juneau
for the month of July. Before we go forward with these dates, is that okay with you? There would still
be some window replacement in June, but it would not prevent the Governor from staying at the
Mansion (Library, Dining room, Ballroom, etc.).
