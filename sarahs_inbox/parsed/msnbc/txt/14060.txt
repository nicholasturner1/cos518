             MESSAGE:

             Thank you for recognizing my grandmother's (Alaska Linck) contributions to the state as a
             pioneer and territorial legislator.   Like you, this state and its people were always her
             first concern.   Lowering the flag in her honor is a privilege she especially would
             appreciate.

             Phyllis Tate
