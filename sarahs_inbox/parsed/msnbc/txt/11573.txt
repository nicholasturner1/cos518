            Janice,
                                                                                                    Alaska
            On Jan . 7th, I spoke to Dr . Cathy Baldwin Johnson on an inaugural Pathways to Hope :
            Native Summit on Child Sexual Abuse conference that was occuring that same week in
            Anchorage . Due to the Governor ' s conflicting schedule , she was unable to attend. Cathy
            did not mention or email me anything about a trip to Juneau .     I just called Cathy and left
            her a voice mail on her cell phone .    As soon as I hear back , I'll let you know.

            Janice , for reference that number is Privileged.
