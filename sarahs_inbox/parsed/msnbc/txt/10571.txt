             Folks, I am sending this note to let you know that the APOC approved at its commission
             meeting last week a referral of lobbyist Ashley Reed to this office for consideration of
             criminal prosecution. (I just learned this today, by the way.)   Apparently he has a 21
             year history of late and incomplete reporting under the lobbyist registration and
             reporting requirements.  Patty Ware, staff at APOC, is putting together a report which
             will be provided to the AG. However, she is not ready to send it yet and thinks it may
             take her a few weeks. I am giving you this forewarning because the commissioners acted in
             an open meeting. Because the request for the referral was made in public meeting, there
             may be press interest.

                                                                      1
