here are the instructions to christines office for our 2pm mtg today



As you approach the airport stay to the right and look for sign directing bus access into c concourse
parking. Look for visitor parking. Go through the door at the outside end of cocourse c. Straight
through to elevator go to fourth floor.




                                                    1                             ROSTON 02828
