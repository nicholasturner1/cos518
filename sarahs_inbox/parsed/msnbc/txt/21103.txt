         Excellent idea to have the minority report. Thanks for suggesting that to her.



         No idea what the majority is coming up with, but hopefully they're keeping in mind budget
         realities in AK's near future!

         Hey kris,



         I had brkfst w cathy this morning on my way to the airport. She said she's going to try
        and get ahold of you re; concerns w the recc that may come out of the hlth council. I
        suggested those in line w gov palin write a minority report to also submit to gov palin by
        the Jan 1 deadline. That way, the administration can implement reccs from both vantage
        pts, or even those just from the minority to send a msg that the council did not follow
        through w what was asked of them. Just wanted to give you a heads up on something coming
        your way relatively soon.

          Take care,

          Ivy
