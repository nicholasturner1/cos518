          Hi Pat,




         May I submit an op-ed that explains the intent of our ACES plan? Alaskans need to
         remember it's imperative that we determine the value of our oil today as it's being sold
         for such a premium, and that we must create an inviting environment for new investment.



         I've crafted a 675-word piece . Should I submit?



         Thanks,

         Sarah Palin
