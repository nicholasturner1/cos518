                   Subject: baby gifts

                 Governor-

                Pat from the Empire would like to know about baby gifts. He wants to know if you expect a lot and
                what would you do if you have a bunch of extras. If you were thinking of donating or didn't want
                to be inundated with stuff I could tell him - The Governor appreciates all of the well wishes she has
                received so far and encourages folks to donate to XXX or XXX.

                Thoughts?

                 Thank you Randy,

                I agree with this strategy and we'll have everybody in place for the meeting. I'll talk about this Monday at our
                meeting. Dianne, John et. all will be in attendance. I just saw Tails up here in Fairbanks. Sandra is walking for her
                Masters in education and I didn't know, but Talis is walking for his Doctorate also. I'm impressed with both of
                them.

                thanx
                Joe
