            Bottom line, we wont conduct politics as usual. We put forth a good budget - they wanna
            cut? We agree to streamline and slow the growth of govt- but they need to explain to
            Alaskans what they've done to our budget. Thanks!

            Governor,



            Tomorrow is the deadline for budget amendment to the House Finance Committee. The
            subcommittee reports are in and now is the typical time that the administration submits
            requests to the committee for reconsideration of problematic budget reductions .  Right now
            it looks like there was approximately $ 100 million reduced from our amended budget. This
            includes the $7 million for fish and game to replace federal funds , nearly $5 million for
            the BP corrosion lawsuit , quite a bit out of health and social services and even the
            university.



              wanted to run a strategy b you.          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
