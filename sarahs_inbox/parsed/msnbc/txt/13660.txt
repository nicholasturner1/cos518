               Subject : HCS CSSB 221(FIN), Sec. 4 p 16 line 13 Sheldon Jackson Hatchery Training Facility
               Governor Palin:

               HCS CSSB 221(FIN), Sec. 4 p 16 line 13 supports the salmon hatchery training operation at Sitka's
               Sheldon Jackson Campus.

               Please support this $250,000 appropriation.

              Sitka Sound Science Center, a 501c3 non -profit, will operate the hatchery as a training facility in
              cooperation with existing programs at University of Alaska Southeast as well as continuing a relationship
              with NOAA. This funding is a great start to renew operations on the former Sheldon Jackson College
              campus' waterfront Sage Building.

              The appropriation will help establish new jobs to replace the one hundred lost when SJ closed and will
              preserve the salmon brood stock now in place at the hatchery.

              This is a good investment that will produce returns in fish , jobs and scientific research.

               Respectfully,

               John Stein
