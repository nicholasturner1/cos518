        Hello,

        If you don't mind me being wishy-washy- I'm going to see if we can work something out so
        that we can go on the 1:30pm. flight and make it to dinner. You know how it goes with
        work, kids and stuff! :)

        I'll get right back to you with a definite answer!

        Thank you,

        Erika
