             Sharon- I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault's taking out PSIO positions and BP corrosion
             lawsuit funds out of my budget. Is back here in DC speaking with Cneney (sat with him the
             entire State dinner last night), will try to speak w/Bush today... speaking with national
             reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide sound oversight
             of resource development, as evidenced by PSIO, lawsuits to hold industry's feet to the
             fire re: waste of valuable natural resources, etc... and here while I'm away I find out
             the legislature may undermine those efforts? It's unacceptable if the nation is to
             believe we're capable of responsible, ethcial ramped up development that's need in our
             state, for our nation.
