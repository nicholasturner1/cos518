    Hello Everyone,

   If you have a minute please proof this for me. I'm not 100% on the grey area... Could be replaced with
   Join us in preserving a piece of our Alaskan Heritage. Join us in preserving a treasured part of our
   Alaskan Heritage... Join us in preserving our Alaska Governor's House.... Invaluable part of our
   Alaskan Heritage. I prefer to have the minimal amount of information on an invite, so it's easy to focus
   on the main points. Your input is appreciated, and if I don't hear back I'll just use this draft.

   As an F.Y.I. this year's theme for the National Preservation Month is "Making Preservation Work".
   There's a really nice web site on this annual event, with quite a bit of helpful information.



                                                                                                 ROSTON 00199
