          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin



          Congratulations on the birth of your new son. I have a son to he is 34 now and a good kid
          to.

          I would like to say say to you that I do not think enough has been done for the rail road
          here I see that lots of money is bneing spent on capital budget items all over the state
          and thats okay by me.

          I would like to see the rail road built to white horse Canada at least I think the rail
          road in Canada stops there in White Horse.

          The rail road would lower the freight rates and the tourists could put there motor homes
          on it and come up to see Alaska

          probably alot cheaper then buying gas along the way through Canada.

          Anyway I think it would be a good investment in Alaska,s futer to have a rail connection
          with the lower 48.




               Best Regards



                                                               1
