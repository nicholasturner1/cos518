                 Subject: Response to Senator Dyson's Re: Eagle River Loop Road

               Governor:

               DOTs response to Senator Dyson's draft editorial on Eagle River Loop Road is attached . My understanding is
               that over the years, DOT has communicated these points to him.
               Would you like me try and talk with the Senator on these issues?
