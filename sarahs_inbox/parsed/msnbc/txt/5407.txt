           Governor, in case you are reading emails, would you be able to fit in another event on Saturday before or after
           the Mother/ Daughter tea? Please see emails below.

           I've talked with Richard and it sounds like it would work well. The back drop needs to be a gymnasium. The
           MotherlDaughter tea event from I - 3pm is at Gladys Wood Elementary. He is following up with the camera crew
           to see if they'd be available at either 12:30 or 3:00 p.m. It's a 30 minute window that is needed but he doesn't
           think it'll take more than 15 minutes. The script would be "help stamp out hunger". Or we could change it up a bit
           if we'd like by adding "Alaska".

           Karl, can you check w/the Governor when you talk w/her to make sure that she's okay with this and that there's
           no scheduling conflict (not sure if she was planning to head out to Valley, etc). I'll wait to hear before I finalize.

           Saturday sounds good to me. We should do it in Anchorage for the consistent "look and feel" that
           others will receive. Please check and see if it's even an option for those in charge.

           I rec'd a phone call from Richard Feight (sp?) who apparently spoke to the Governor at an event (I think it was the
           Governor's Prayer Breakfast) about participating in an ad campaign for the National Association of Letter Carriers'
           food drive. He said that she was interested in participating . I cannot recall the gentleman or the conversation.

           It would be a tag-on to their ad . Mayor Mark Begich will be doing it next week . They.have a crew here in
           Anchorage that is doing the filming . I explained that the Governor will be out -of-town next week and that the
           majority of her time is in Juneau during the legislation session . Should we decide to do this, it would need to be
           completed the earlier part of the week of April 16t'.
