            MESSAGE:

            The birth of Trig. As the parent of a wonderful son Jeffery born to us December 20th 1972
            with Downs Syndrome I want you to know we feel truly blessed to be picked to have such a
            wonderful and loving person as Jeffery to have came into our lives.Jeffery is now 35 years
            of age and not a moment goes by that his presents does not shine a bright light on all
            aspects of daily life.



            In 1972 our family Dr. was kind enough to inform us that most families would turn a child
            born with Downs over to an institution and he brought to light the difficulties of raising
            such a child.



            I can only imagine all the fun and wonderful times we would have missed if we had followed
            the Drs. suggestion .




            The amount of love Jeffery has for all people and animals is unmeasurable



            In closing I hope you understand you and your husband are very lucky to have Trig come
            into your lives .



            Thanks,
                                                                  1
