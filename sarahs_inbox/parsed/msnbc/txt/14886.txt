                          Governor Sarah Patin
                          Your Honor,

                          We would first like to congratulate you and your entire family
                          on the birth of your handsome new son Trig.

                          The loss of the longevity bonus has been devastating to us as
                          well as our old friends. To have abruptly discontinued this program
                          was unfair and unjust to those it was originally Intended for.

                          Those in the legislature who refer to Mr.Hickle and others who live
                          on the hillside as not deserving are In error, in that these are the very people who
                          contributed the most in building this great state.

                         There is no doubt that those of greater wealth also contribute many
                         dollars to charity.

                         Most of us considered this bonus as part of our retirement program,
                         its cancellation caused us great hardship. the senior program which
                         you chose to continue put us in financial jeopardy due to the means
                         test. If the reinstatement of the bonus is impossible , then perhaps the
                         means test should be increased to $40. 000.00 ormore. This would keep your promise to
                         seniors in need.

                         A promise made should be a promise kept

                          "HAPPY MOTHERS DAY"
