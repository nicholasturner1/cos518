             MESSAGE:

             Just wanted to add my congratulations on the birth of your little boy. He was born on my
             birthday, and I can tell you it is a great day to be born! Springtime, new beginnings, and
             sometimes Easter will fall on his birthday.



             My dear friend Cathleen has a little girl, almost 2 now, who has Down syndrome. Lilly is
             an incredible child, warm, loving, deeply interested in her world, and a delight to have
             around. Through Cathleen and Lilly I've learned a lot about the Down syndrome world, and
             it is truly a happy and positive place. Trig is lucky to have parents who understand that
             he is indeed a lovely gift. Enjoy!
