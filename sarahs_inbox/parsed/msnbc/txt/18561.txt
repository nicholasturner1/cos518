          We MUST be ready on this one.

          We will also need a bio on Track and his friend, including photos.

          Also- he's joining through the Buddy Program. His best friend probably doesnt mind the
          media interest nearly as much as Track does. They enlist together tomorrow if all paper
          work is in place. They hadn't even realized it's 9-11 tomorrow.

          Good idea. We've already been asked if the military can use this for pr... I may have one
          of you call Track be he rolls his eyes when his mom broaches the subject of "media
          interest". Let me talk to him again and then you may want to get a quote from him.

         Sharon:

         We need to have a statement ready today so that when the governor wants to comment we'll
         be ready.  This WILL become NATIONAL news and we need to be prepared and proactive. Some
         military official will use this and we need to be ready sooner rather than later. I'd
         rather have something in the can that we don't use (in case it doesn't become an issue)
         than get caught.

         Hi again- another head's up:

         If all goes according to (Track's!) plans, he'll be enlisiting in the US Army, active
         duty, tomorrow. He doesn't want any publicity on this, tho it sounds like a Seattle media
         person already called be it may be that there aren't many, or any, US Govs who have a son
         recently enlisting.



         I warned him that media may make a little deal out of it, but we don't desire such a thing
         be Track is enlisting for the right reasons and he's just anxious to go serve (without any
         publicity). And I'm proud of him for doing so.



         Thanks!    And pray for mama's strength through this! :)

        Beth- there's another ADN letter to the editor that criticizes my "working from home in
        wasilla" bs... I don't know if you guys are following that misperceived issue that is
                                                        3

          growing legs , but we know that when we see where an issue is going ( and growing ), unless
          we hustle to counter it and correct the record , then it ' s only going to get worse.



          Sharon told an ADN editor that I, like other Govs , work out of the Anchorage office... he
          sounded surprised with that news . But he still did the "thumbs down" evaluation in his
          editorial on Sunday , they ran another letter claiming nonsense again today ... this is
          evidently an issue he ' s not going to correct so we have to do it ouselves.



          Yes, i "work from home " as emails begin usually at 4am and I "work at home " through the
          night ... But we know the true situation of the seven - days - a-week work , most always in
          Anchorage and of course in Juneau during session.



          However Communications folks can help communicate this , pls do so today be this will only
          get worse . Pls let me know what you guys can do on this , perhaps it ' s letters to the
          editor. Also , pls contact the editor ( s) again and let them hear the truth again . Please.



          Thank you
