                  Dear Representative Crawford,
                    This is a follow up to our discussion at the last joint constituent meeting.
                    Please support a capital appropriation that fully matches the $2 million Pool Bond which is on the
                  Anchorage April 1st ballot.
                    This is a public health and safety issue that warrants state assistance.
                  Thank you,
                  Pete Crosby
                  Anchorage
