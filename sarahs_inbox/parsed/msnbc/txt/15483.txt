            I just gave Steve a call re: cockerham's budget story. He said Ann wrote one too and would
            check in w her to see where it ran. He said there could likely be a follow-up budget story
            on tues and he'd follow up w us before he filed. He was intrigued by the operating cuts
            and he or ann will follow up w Karen.

            Hey Steve,

            When is AP following up on the AND budget story? Cockerham, I think, failed to grasp the
            hard work that went into making cuts, being fair, distributing appropriations
            proportionally, etc. No project was ever veto proof. The governor and her team made this
            very clear months ago and has continued to say it throughout the budget process. Meyer's
            comments about a "gentlemen's agreement" are rediculous. The governor said she would add
            some of last year's vetoed projects into this year's capital budget to consider them
            again, not to fund all of them. A large majority of them were funded this year despite his
            comments. Also, Stedman, shouldn't be complaining about projects he didn't receive,
            instead he should focus on the point that his senate district alone received more capital
            funding and projects than any of the others in the state. His focussing on the few
            projects that were cut in his is as he calls it "pure politics". Also, Cockerham didn't
            seem to understand the significance of reducing the operating budget. Governor's rarely
            reduce the operating; the last time was under Rickel I believe, some 20 yrs ago. The
           .governor is comitted to reducing the growth of government, cutting uneeded operations,
            while also holding harmless education funding that she worked tirelessly for last session,
            and also labor contract increases that were agreed upon between the state and various
            unions. Her reduction on the operating side goes straight to the cbr. The governor crafted
            two thoughtful and fair budgets that Alaskans will appreciate. Thanks for your time Steve.
            I appreciate you listening. Please let me know if you or Ann needs to touch base with the
            governor's office today. I'm in and out of cell coverage, but leave a voicemail or send an
            email and I'll get back to you asap.

            Thanks!

            Ivy
