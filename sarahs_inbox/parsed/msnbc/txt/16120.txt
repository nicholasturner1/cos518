            Hi R- hope you're having a good weekend.



            There were a few Ft Wainwright visit pictures in Fairbank's newspaper yesterday- could you
            get them so I can sign for Oscar Hall and the soldier shown in one of them- I could only
            see the pics online, but they looked like appropriate ones to signature and send from our
            office. Thanks! (Maybe a copy for the base, too, as one pic showed Todd looking at their
            Wall of Honor.)
