             Unless our statement is:" Senate made the right call to provide the stability our state's
             economy needs, and we look forward to their confirmation of tonight's majority vote when
             the Senators reconvene tomorrow morning. "

             Governor,




             The Senate did vote to pass the bill but there was a notice of reconsideration given.
             That means that the bill will need to come up again tomorrow for one more vote .  We were
             thinking about sending out a statement tonight but given the lack of finality tonight, I
             was thinking we should wait until tomorrow ( after the final vote ). Is this OK with you?
