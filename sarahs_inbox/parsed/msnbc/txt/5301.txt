                 Subject: Re: Chuck Hamel
                  Chuck left several messages on my work phone over the weekend. In the last
                  one, he said that the Governor had called him and has designated staff to
                  receive his future calls. He sounded quite happy.

                  Because of the DC relevance, I will stay in touch with him as well.

                       Chuck Hamel has been calling nonstop to try and get an appointment with you while you are in DC.
                       He says he has important FBI information about corruption at Prudhoe Bay that you need to know
                       about. I have asked both Joe Balash and Meg Stapleton to call him . John Bitney recommends you
                       do not talk to him directly , that one of your staff should . John wants somebody from the staff to find
                       out what he's calling about so he doesn 't spring something on you. He knows you are in DC for
                       NGA so he may try to run into you somewhere , he is very adamant about talking directly to you.
