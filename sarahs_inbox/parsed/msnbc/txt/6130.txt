             I talked with Kris Perry today and let her know that I was available to help you in whatever way you need
             to take the load off across the next few weeks/months as you look for a replacement for John. If you want
             me involved in any calls or strategy sessions with your team , I'll make myself available. If you want me to
             pick up a project or two off your plate, whether it involves the legislature or an agency or community, I'll
             help out wherever you need. Just give me direction and your instructions and I'll do it.

            Sean
