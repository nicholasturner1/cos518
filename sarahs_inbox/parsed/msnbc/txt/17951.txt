              I don't know the history of these issues, or of the dept. in general - so those who do should chime
              in. thanks!

               The attached is not exhaustive, but it will give you an idea of what Rob
               Stapleton would like to cover in his agriculture interview with the Governor
               and Commissioner Irwin on Tuesday at 1:30pm in the Governor's Anchorage
               office.

               He will be rather skeptical and confused because he feels that it's not the
               administration's priority and that the ag department is quite unorganized
               and confused on its own policy (DeVilbiss' resignation only added to it).
