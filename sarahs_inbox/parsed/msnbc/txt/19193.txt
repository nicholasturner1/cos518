          Does he realize we are very supportive of in state also and I've asked the AGIA team to
          ramp up that message publicly, as I fear that message was lost through the revealing of
          the TC-Alaska "big line" plan? Marty could provide the Senator more infomation on
          precisely what we're doing to ensure in-state use and benefits of our gas. (I'd hope his
          testimony would acknowledge that we're on the same page with in-state.)

             Also, hopefully he could weave in that          our Surplus Revenue Return proposal shows how
          oil/gas revenue DOES help ourselves as we          attempt to relieve burdens on AK residents by
          returning surplus dollars to them to help          meet the rising cost of living - it's a short
          term plan as we work towards conservation          and long term energy relief plans.

          Senator Stevens contacted me last night to find out what you would think about his
          testifying at the special session on in-state energy issues.

    i

          He does support an in-state solution. However, his primary objective would be to show the
          Congress how state oil revenues can be used to benefit the citizenry. He believes that
          the second special session will exemplify how opening ANWR and offshore areas in Alaska
          would provide significant non-tax revenues to the U.S. Treasury, thereby benefitting the
          economy in several ways.



          For whatever it's worth, I believe that this is a good idea. I'm not. sure that anything
          will budge the Democratic Leadership in Congress, but the publicity should help keep the
          spotlight on Alaska's oil and gas resources.



          I think that the ultimate decision about his testifying must be made by the Legislature.
          However, the Senator didn't want to proceed without your approval. My guess is that the
          beneficial electoral implications are not lost on the Senator, either.



          I also mentioned to him that we would probably respond to Dan Fagan's Sunday.column, which
          I characterized as beyond fair criticism of a politician in a situation where Fagan had
          previously been apprized of the facts.

                                                                1
