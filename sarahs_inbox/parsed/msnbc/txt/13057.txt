          Subject:                 Larry Wood

          Update:  I've sent emails to McHugh, BG Katkus and Commissioner Campbell. Got a response
          from McHugh - he talked w/Nizich. Katkus responded that he's traveling; his letter was
          forwarded. Got a response from Craig - no info/he plans to talk w/Nizich tomorrow (his
          email below).



          I've asked to be kept in the loop. I suspect Nizich and/or Craig will update you directly
          tomorrow.



          Found out that Larry sent a letter to you and Russ last August.              Russ responded and I've
          requested a copy of it.



          Confidentially/not to fwd: I'm not sensing any urgency, but then it wasn't their name
          slandered in the paper with no prior knowledge. I'd like to see a letter of clarification
          or correction, which I will convey once I get more information on the whole issue.

          Thanks.  I would appreciate being kept in the loop as this is a constituent that contacts
          this,office and who I have met with previously. I've heard that he is submitting a letter
          to the editor in the ADN as well which may be in the paper tomorrow. I suspect this will
          come up again at that time and the Governor will ask what the status is.

           In follow-up to the Governor ' s email regarding Larry Wood and his letter to

           the editor ; I can contact McHugh and Brigadier General Katkus to get more
