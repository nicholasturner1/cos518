             Dear Governor Palin,

                   Just so you know. The US Supreme Court just issued an order denying the plaintiffs
             request that our lawyer be allowed to participate in the oral argument before the Court on
             Feb. 27.  This was relayed to us by the attorney we had hired to do that argument.
              Therefore, our input will be limited to the amicus brief (you have a copy). Talis
