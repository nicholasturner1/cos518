                  Subject: juneau chamber

                I got a call from Cathie Roemmich this afternoon about your gasline team speaking at chamber next week. She
                said that there was miscommunication in her office and that her staff had accidentally booked Ralph Samuels on
                the same day . She asked my opinion and I told her I appreciated the call , but it was up to her discretion. I did
                point out that it would be two anti -ACES presentations in a row and she said that she would keep your team
                scheduled for next week. She thought I made a great point and asked that I convey to you that her chamber
                remains neutral : )

                Also, she put me at a front table at the chamber dinner on Saturday if Ms. Piper wants to sit by me while you
                address the crowd : )
