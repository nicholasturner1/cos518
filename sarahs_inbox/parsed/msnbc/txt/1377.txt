 GILA Graduation Ceremony Remarks
 Location : Galena Interior Learning Academy
 Friday, May 16 , 2008 @ 7 p.m.
 Brief Remarks
 Todd Palin


 Hi, it's great to be here celebrating with you on such an important occasion! Graduating
 from high school is a big deal and your first step into a bright future. My wife, Sarah, sends
 her congratulations on your achievements!


 You know, Sarah - as your Governor, she's committed to providing employment
 opportunities and a strong economy for you guys. And having grown up in Bristol Bay, I
 know firsthand it's vital that rural economies further their economic growth - and what better
way than to train Alaskans for Alaskan jobs? With the education, training, and preparation
you've received, you will have several different industries to choose from.


I've worked on the Slope for years, and both Sarah and I are committed to vocational and
technical training and education for Alaska's youth as we prepare for the Alaska Gas
Pipeline. With the gas pipeline construction happening in the near future, many of you can
fill those jobs needed for construction of the gasline and support services.


You guys have many opportunities to choose from in the coming months and years. The
bottom line is this : Alaska 's workforce is aging - and you have this incredibly timely and
lucrative opportunity to fill the gap and continue building and developing Alaska for the next
generation . No pressure , but the future of Alaska depends on YOU©, and ensuring the
availability of a skilled workforce now and in coming years.


In closing, I just want to say again , that Sarah and I are proud of you and all your hard work
- we know that high school isn't always easy, even though it's been a few years since our
graduation©. I also want to thank the Sydney Huntington School and Galena Interior
Learning Academy administrators, teachers, residential living support, and all the parents,
families, and friends here for investing in these students - you all share in their success.
Thank you and Congratulations! .
                                                                          ROSTON 02475
