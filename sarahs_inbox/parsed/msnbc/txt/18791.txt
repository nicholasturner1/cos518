          I will make sure that happens. This may also be a good opportunity to reach out to senate
          members (leadership) urging them to take advantage of the ACES briefings.

          Sheeeesh - I went on AK GOP website last night. Ben is STILL the GOP National
          Committeeman! So he and Ruedrich are still the faces of the party in the state and they
          represent the party nationally.



          It is time to call for Ben's outster from that position. A short comment on this is long
          overdue, and now that Ben's been named as one who was bribed (duh...), it's irresponsible
          of me NOT to call for him to step down.



          There's no "separation of powers" issue to respect here as there is with calling for the
          unindicted Cowdery to step down. I'm free to call for this with Ben.



          Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to do so today, in passing I will let ktuu or ap know
          my opinion on this.
