I just spoke with Tom here at the office. Since the kids are going to the family events, we are making
arrangements for the KingAir. Tom is also making calls this morning for lodging.



Kris, let's go over Melissa's draft schedule today and give her a call a little later. Also, the Governor
indicated that Bernie would like her to visit Chena Hot Springs on her next trip so let's talk about that
as well. Thanks.



Mike

Haven't heard on accomodations for fairbanks this wk - I can make arrangements if we haven't done
this yet - I had sent an earlier email stating I'll talk to whomever is making the arrangements. Anyone
know what's up with this week's trip?
