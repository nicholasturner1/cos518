                Governor:

                Good news on the proposed federal rule that could devastate the Alaska cruise industry and many of the Alaska
                owned businesses that depend on it. If Secretary Chertoff decides to go the other way f    staff recommendations
                and include Alaska in the rule, our AG's office has been working on several legal issues Privile ed or Personal Mat
                Privileged or PPrcnnal ua+ari71 We will keep tracking this.

                Sen. Murkowski's office reports that the final decision on the proposed cruise ship rules is on
                Homeland Security Secretary Chertoffs desk, and that it looks very good for Alaska . The staff
                recommendation to the secretary is exclude Alaska from the rule interpretation.

                Word could come any day now.
