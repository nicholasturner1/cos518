Todd,



One lobbyist , Don Etheridge attended the fundraiser . Lobbyist, Jerry Reinwand (personal check and
on behalf of Premera ) contributed , but did not attend . Randy Ruaro said that lobbyist Ray
Matiochowski was going to attend /contribute , but a check has not been received . Ron King is not a
lobbyist but he 's with the Alaska Public Employees Association/AFT and he attended the event.



This is according to the APOC list of lobbyists, which I assume is current. Let me know if you need
anymore information.



We didn't make it on our flight... at the last minute I couldn't find my drivers license and didn't get
through DMV fast enough. We'll leave on tonight's flight.



Thanks,

Erika
