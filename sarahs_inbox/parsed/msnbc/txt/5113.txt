                Hey, he's got a new boss now, right?! Let's allow him good direction so that we DO see a
                dramatic improvement in educ.

                Thanks for coordinating with Meg on the state of state . Let us (incl. Ivy) know of your
                suggestions for bd. appts.

                Anything new on the radio gig?

                  I have just heard the news about the reinstatement of commissioner Sampson. I am disappointed but hope
                  he will implement your policies well and that we will see a dramatic improvement in education and sincere
                  integration with Labor and Commerce. In the event of a continuation of past performance, perhaps Mr.
                  LeDoux will have an opportunity to serve you in the future.

                  If you are interested, I have a number of people who would be good state board of education members.

                  Back to the State of the State.

                  God Bless,
