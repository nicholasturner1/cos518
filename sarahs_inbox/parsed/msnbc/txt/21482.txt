                   Subject: Thank you from DAB @ DMV

                 Dear Governor Palin and Staff,

                 Please accept my most sincere thanks for the opportunity to serve as your director of the Division of Motor
                 Vehicles; it has been the highlight of my professional career.

                 I will be leaving DMV next month and I wish the very best for each of you and especially for this Administration as
                 a whole; truth, honesty and open government shall always be best for those governed by it.

                 As I leave, I must point out that any success garnered here in last 4.5 years belongs solely with these extremely
                 dedicated DMV employees ; staff members that day by day are the 'face ' of state government in a venue perhaps
                 unlike any other stage . Please support and thank them as often as possible for their dedication and efforts.

                 The State of Alaska is facing challenges , and I believe you are well positioned to successfully manage them for
                 the maximum benefit of all Alaskans into the future.

                 Thank you again for this incredible chance to make Alaska just a little 'bit better!

                 Very Respectfully,

                 Duane A Bannock
