            MESSAGE:

            CONGRATULATIONS on the birth of your little boy. We are thrilled at the family's comments
            about his birth. My husband and I are raising our 6 year old granddaughter Andrea who also
            has Down Syndrome. Her Mother (our daughter) died almost 3 years ago so we have full
            custody of her. Just in case you don't know, these are some of the most loving and
            affectionate children and they add so much to your lives. You are in for a real treat. You
            and your husband will face challenges with him that you have not had to face with your
            other children, probably but you will also experience more joy than you ever thought
            possible. We call them our "angels" and feel so blessed to have them on the earth with us.
            With early intervention, it is amazing what these children can accomplish. I could go on
            and on about them but I will just say again: CONGRATULATIONS and our best wishes for a
            very long and rewarding life for all of you. Most sincerely, Andrea's grandma (but now
            Mommy 1)
