            Commissioners,

           I wanted to pass on the resume of the top candidate for the Royalties Bd. Kristan is a community leader in the
           Mat-Su Valley , and a successful realtor with a BA and MA in Business Administration . She's a good supporter, a
           quick study, and I think will be a good board member. If you have questions please don't hesitate to call on me.

           Thanks,

           Ivy Frye
