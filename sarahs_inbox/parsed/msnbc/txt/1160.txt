MESSAGE:

Congratulations Governor Palin and family! You have been truly blessed with the birth of your 5th
child. Though most news articles have not listed what kind of special challenges your new son has, I
was able to find one that listed some of the challenges associated with Down syndrome. My youngest
child has Down syndrome- William will be 8 in August. Our family has truly been blessed by all that
he has taught us since before his birth. He is currently in a mainstream first grade class and has a
reading level at and above the 'typical' kids in his classroom (he is the only one with Down syndrome
in his school).



I am sure Trig will be well-loved by all who meet him. Welcome to the world Trig!



Congratulations again Governor Palin and family!



Kei Malone
