           Thanks Sean. No one 's done anything since I added to the intro, which I emailed you. Beth
           is on vacation so no one 's done any work on it... and I haven't sent the edited intro
           draft to Mike or Beth.

           Hi,

           Both Kate and Jason have done some work on the state of the state draft and I wanted to
           work on it this weekend. In your crazy week have you or your staff written any more
           current drafts or material. I don't want to be four drafts behind where you are currently
           if I can send you something this weekend.



           Sean
