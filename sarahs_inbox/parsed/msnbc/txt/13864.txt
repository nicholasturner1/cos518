             Murder, that's what happened in Fort Yukon. All of those "hunters" need to be identified
           and prosecuted. They hunted and shot a bear, a POLAR BEAR, that went into a "village" to
           eat a carcus that probably was also illegal and left to lie in a location that could have
           been bear baiting itself. What is going on in this town? Not only was it a polar bear but
           it was a sow and on top of this the Polar Bear is endangered. According to the Fairbanks
           Daily News-Miner this bear wandered into the village age a linx carcus then left. These
           "hunters" trailed it 3 miles before they realized that the alchol was back in town. The
           bear was leaving town!!! Had it returned then I could have maybe agreeded with what had
           happened. Fish and Game never got notified until after the bear was shot. Makes me wonder
           what would happen to a out-of-towner who wonders into their village.
