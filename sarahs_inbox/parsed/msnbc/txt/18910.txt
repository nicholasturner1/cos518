             Doh! shoulda read your email before sending the other one from Benson... Sorry Kris.

             Governor, all of your emails are coming from your State account (govpalin@alaska.gov) right
             now, not your yahoo. I'm going to check with Barb on that, as its probably a setting that got
             accidentally changed on Friday.

              I think everyone had expected the press release, op-ed and press conference would be next week,
              not this week. Randy had put together a very thorough checklist for the entire operation -- for
              next week. Oh well.

              But the real issue is why are you up so early, at work? At least for me it's almost 10 a .m. I hope
              the rest of your day is somewhat work-free.

              Thank you very much. I appreciate your advice.

              I assumed everyone had their marching orders from Monday on, as the leg liason group was in
              on helping craft the press release - they were even physically in the Anchorage office helping
              with the issue before heading back to Juneau - and they seemed anxious to have all ducks in a
              row before releasing, so it took a few days longer than expected to get the presser out... but
              obviously I should never assume, and this week was full of lessons learned.

              Ditto for media comments on the fellas this week. Lessons learned.

              Thank you Larry. Kris just said again the other day after speaking with you that she, too, is
              thankful you're working with us, for Alaska. Don't hesitate to advise, we appreciate it.

              Ahhhh, what a week. Of lessons learned.

              OK, it's Saturday morning and I'm full of opinions. So I might as well share them.

              Mike/Russ/Randy: Holy moly - Kyle Johanson's comments are as biting as Bert Stedman's were
              (in adn this morning). When did you guys talk to them - when the presser was first crafted on
              Monday? Why do they say they were shocked yesterday?
              Bert didn't sound as angry as "shocked" when I talked to him yesterday, but even that surpsrised
              me because I'm assuming this was communicated to him at the beginning of the week.

              Also, as Sharon knows , the Stevens story grew legs NOT out of any "demand" I made for him to
              talk to Alaskans, as KTUU reported last night. When asked three times in two days by different
              reporters if I thought Stevens should talk about the investigation , I did say I thought Alaskans
              want to hear any information he can provide , and it's appropriate and deserved to give him the
              benefit of the doubt - and Alaskans get frustrated when he can't or isn 't providing information on
              his innocence.

              It's very clear the adn reporter made my comments sound more inciteful than necessary. AP
              report was more in context, but the headline was rough. I'm not "demanding" Stevens do
              anything, just as I'm not "demanding " state senate leadership strip Cowdery of Rules - I won't

               tell anyone what to do and I don't have the authority to do so anyway. These questions have been
               impossible to avoid and I'll continue to give my opinion, but it's unfortunate the Stevens
               comment is made to sound more controversial than I intended.

             I've been thinking about it for a week now. Tough tough tough.. .there are folks that I think
             would be effective in getting things done, but I don't know know where they fall on the "trust"
             factor. I just don't have any evidence either way to be honest .... no good, no bad. These are
             people that I've only known lightly for one session, so no deep history with them unfortunately.
