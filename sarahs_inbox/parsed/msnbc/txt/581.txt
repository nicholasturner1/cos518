Sounds like a plan.



I'm on my way to the campground but I can start looking tomorrow night. Take a peak at
www.paradisevillage.com. Its a little pricey but neen and C have been going since they built it.
Excellent resort on the tip of its own penninsula in puerto vallarta. The piece I need to check is
weather for mexico vs hawaii in august, but paradise village is 5 star if weather is nice. I'm sure I can
get a deal wherever u go, and hopefully use companiom tkts to get the price down.



So.... no idea on price for reds?
