             Subject:                 Leaked Email

             Mike- still haven't gotten to the bottom of the leaked email and I don't know what you've
             found or even if you're working on it... but Mr. Maher wasn't on the list that Sunny sent
             (it was your forwarded email she sent to that mass distribution list - many people I did
             not know on the list, and of course - as I subsequently explained - I did not expect, nor
             want, all those employees to read my original and candid email so a lesson was learned
             through that episode)... bottom line still has to be answered: did you send the email to
             Maher ? I'll ask Sunny again for the list of recipients from her computer, but I'd rather
             not bug her about it again. Thanks
