         is a big hunter an active in AOC. I don, t snow    a seat requirements or who else is on
         the list to see the big picture. I can go back through my email today to see if there is
         something more comprehensive from Frank. If there is, I would have missed it.    I will
         probably need to touch base with Frank to get the latest, which I will do today.

        Yes the appointments are done but the presser was going Mon so we could send the cacfa
        names at the same time . My understanding was all appointees and unsuccessuls for D&A
        Council were notified yesterday by 3pm, apparently she was not reached. I'll call her
        now.



         I did not hear back from mike on cacfa so we will send this presser out Monday regardless.
