                Dear Gov. Palin:
                 Congratulations on your new baby . Please don't veto the money for the
                Community Health centers. As you know senior citizens are having a tough
                time getting health care in Alaska , we need all the help we can get.
                  Thank you for doing a good job as Govorner. I especially like the way you are
                standing up to the oil companys. I have lived in Alaska for thirty eight years
                and plan on being planted here.
                                                                  Respectfully,
                                                                  William B. Hosey
