             I did not get a chance to tell you Friday, but we had an extradition order that needed to be signed ASAP. It was to
             send a fugitive charged with murder back to California. Since I was out of the office, Nizich signed for me on your
             behalf.

             Mike

             Mike - Please let the Governor know that Mike Nizich will be signing an Extradition for Deandre Tyrese Brunfield
             aka Andre Brunfield aka Deandre Frank aka Andre French. This is a demand for extradition from Department of
             Law that needs to be signed today. The fugitive has been charged with Murder and Possession of a Firearm by a
             Felon-Prior(s). It has been presented by the State of California.

             I have done up an affidavit for Mike Nizich's signature per notification to Governor. Please let her know today.
