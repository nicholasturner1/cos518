            Was just listening to it, Governor. Was surprised to hear him on OCS.

           Subject: Obama



           He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska. Stole

           out Energy Rebate $1000 check idea, stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking

           points, etc. So.... we need to take advantage of this a write a

           statement saying he's right on. (Glad he's flipflopping on OCS, too.)

           Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our "reaction" to

           some of Obama's good points this morning?
