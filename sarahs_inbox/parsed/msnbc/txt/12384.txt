            Truely, this is a great message . I dont mean for my edits to diminsh the message - you
            done good! Im just appalled at them trying to drag us into deal-making. Who has time for
            such nonsense? It's injustice and unfair to Alaskans, too.




            Alaskans! And they must put their expenses on-line along with admins!.

            Governor,



            Tomorrow is the deadline for budget amendment to the House Finance Committee. The
            subcommittee reports are in and now is the typical time that the administration submits
            requests to the committee for reconsideration of problematic budget reductions .  Right now
            it looks like there was approximately $100 million reduced from our amended budget.   This
            includes the $7 million for fish and game to replace federal funds , nearly $5 million for
            the BP corrosion lawsuit , quite a bit out of health and social services and even the
            university.



            I wanted to run a strategy by you.         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
