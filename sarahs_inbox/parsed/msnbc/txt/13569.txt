            Pls forward to Rosanne . For some reason her address isn't accepting my email from either
            one of my addresses . I need the Comm Dept to confirm a presser went out after yesterday's
            bill signing - along with any pics of the students at the ceremony taken by Andy.

            Hi Rosanne- pls make sure we released a presser on yesterday's Silver Hand bill signing at
            the high school so all those students can get credit/recognition for a neat way to
            participate in the legislative process. Thanks. You have my notes re: what I ended up
            saying to the student government students about the bill's relevance to justice, fairness
                                                                  1
