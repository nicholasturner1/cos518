            Subject:                FW: Telephone Call - Capital Budget Request w/Senator Therriault


            Governor - I just received a telephone call from Senator Therriaults' office. Senator
            Therriault is in ANC on Wed. 05.14 (afternoon) and Thur. 05.15.08. The Senator is
            requesting to meet with you in regards to Capital Budget. Per your direction last week on
            the Wilken request - I regretted and asked if they would like to send something in
            writing.  They then contacted Karen as you can see by her response below. Please let me
            know how you would like me to follow up with Senator Therriaults request.




            Thanks, Janice
