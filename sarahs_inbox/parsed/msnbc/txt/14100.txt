                           I heard it a lot on the Michael Dukes to   s ow an severa ime ar un
           Fairbanks.  Even my Dr. said people are cancelling surgeries or at least delaying them
           because of energy bills. People are hurting. We hear it a lot in Fairbanks because power
           and energy are mostly based on oil instead of gas as in Anch. God bless. Tom
