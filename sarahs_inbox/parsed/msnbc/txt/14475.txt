            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I am moved to write you a personal note this morning, having received an email through a
            pro-life organization sharing news of your expanded family. The email said Trig weighed
            in at 6 pounds 2 ounces, and because (according to my mom) that was my birth weight
             (closing in on 49 years ago), I immediately felt a kinship with your new baby boy. The
            email also explained that Trig has Down Syndrome, and expressed your joyous response and
            your thanks to God for entrusting you with the responsibility of caring for him. Your
            attitude humbled me and filled me with joy, reminding me that my challenges are small and
            that I can meet them. Congratulations and best wishes to you and your family.



            Yours truly,

            Joshua Hauser

           Governor - Commissioner Galvin just called and asked if you had 15 minutes today that he
           could meet with you. He said 11:00 a.m. would work for him but anytime you have available
           he will make himself available. He needs to talk with you in regards to AIDEA Director.
           Thank you, Janice
