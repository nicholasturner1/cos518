            Mike- as you and Joe penned the letter, what was/is the plan of action to counter the
            (anticipated?) Horribly harsh criticism we're now receiving? Was it anticipated? What are
            you/we doing to pro-actively counter it and clairfy that of course I want to deal with the
            issue and see those bills passed - maybe the letter didn't quite convey that, but now we
            must "fix" it. Pls let me know what you/we are doing asap to turn this volume down and
            make our committment to hearing these bills again in their own sp session.

            Thank you,     team ,   for everything you did to help with getting our letter

            and message out to the press yesterday.             The Wesley story was very good,

            as was the Bill McAllister story. Great job . It was a team effort.



            Now. About the blogs. As you know , our boss is getting pounded. Let's

            take action. TODAY.




            Frank and Ivy, if you could get the word out to your contacts --

            grassroots supporters who love our boss -- we need to get them out there

            FLOODING that Anchorage Daily News Alaska Politics blog. I mean

                                                                       1

            FLOODING.




            Some ideas of what people can say:

            * Words of support

            * Reminding readers of that blog that the people of Alaska

            overwhelmingly demonstrated their confidence in our boss by bringing her

            into office and that she continues to have their support -- with that 85

            percent approval rating (if that's the right number).

            * Quoting Newt Gingrich that Governor Palin is one of the most

            aggressive reformers in the country (check exact quote)



            Ivy and Frank, can you guys make some calls and make that happen today?

            If you don't have time, please e - mail me some names and numbers and I'll

            call them myself.



            Thanks!
