            I think it sounds more like the whole shebang...where do the revenues come from, how are
            they used, and all of that. Laura Achee is the director of public affairs/communications
            over at the permanent fund corporation and can probably provide all of that.

            It sounds like the questions relate to distribution formulas by the PFD.




            Director of PFD or Jerry Burnett?

           Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to
           the citizens and get bills introduced in the state legislature in california florida and
           elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they should split the revenue stream
           with a specified amount ( maybe half ) going to the citizens as a direct benefit

            How much does each alaskan get?

            What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the
           citizens?

            Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?



            Would you be interested in writing or talking about this?
                                                                 2
