          I will make a few calls to see what we can mobilize. DOT and DMVA have been contacted and
          should get a report by mid morning. We will need Jay in the LG's office call the faith
          based organizations to see what they can provide.

          Is there a way Alaska could be in the forefront of helping hurricane victims from a
          private sector and non-profit perspective?



         I'm thinking of our faith community to provide relief efforts; our transportation
         companies to provide containers, planes, and helicopters; and, perhaps, our electrical
         workers (IBEW??) to restore power. How do we (you?) call them to action and where do we
         plug them into so they are deployed efficiently and usefully?? FEMA? elsewhere? Thoughts?
