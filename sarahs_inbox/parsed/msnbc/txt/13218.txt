            Governor Palin,




            I'm appealing directly to you because my Interior Rep Guttenberg and Sen. Thomas have
            failed to respond to my previous e-mail. I guess they are just too busy or important to
            respond to me, a voter from their district. We in the interior are being rapidly
            strangled by high energy prices and the associated high food prices. We have a very
            vested interest to be able to attend and observe the special session, lobby not only the
            interior delegates but ALL of the legislature on this very important and serious issue.
            PLEASE HOLD THE GASLINE SPECIAL SESSION HERE IN FAIRBANKS! Thank you.




           Very Respectively




                                                                  1
