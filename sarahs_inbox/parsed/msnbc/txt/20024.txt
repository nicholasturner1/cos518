          I'm with Kris on this. Sheila Balastrairi (sp) said this morning that the Governor has NOT
          endorsed a candidate for senate.

          Even that said, not a big deal unless I'm missing something . It isn't specific to one
          candidate. Just my opinion, but I don't think additional follow-up is necessary.

         I hear ya. Here's Megan's exact quote from last night:



         "On July 2nd Palin and Stevens appeared at a press conference about energy .                 Back them she
         said endorsement of a Senate candidate would come at a later date."

          I was there as was Sharon and Nizich . I recall the "now is not the time or place ." And no
          specific mention that an endorsement would be forthcoming.

          Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment . I'll ask Sharon to check on
          what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check . I said weeks ago
          "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate . Those who were with me at
          the event heard it. Can ' t remember who was with me.

          don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
          from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
          don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
          shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
