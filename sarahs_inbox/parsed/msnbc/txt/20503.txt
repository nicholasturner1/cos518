            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,



            I sent you a message a few months back requesting you support Alaskans who participated
            in the ACPE student loan program. In my first message to you I listed some compound
            difficulties I have personally expereinced with the Alaska Advantage program. I also made
            some recommendations for supporting Alaskans who are using their education to promote the
            needs of our state.. I wanted to follow up my first message because I do not believe my
            voice was heard/understood by your office.



                 My message was passed on to Diane Barrans. While I understand Diane is the highest
            authority at ACPE I do not believe it is her issue to deal'with. I have testified at ACPE
            meetings. I have communicated with members of the commission. I have communicated directly
            with Diane. While There are of course some things Diane may be able to address, I do not
            believe Diane should develop the type of program I proposed to your office. Diane is doing
            an excellent job promoting the needs of Alaskans and securing future funding for education
            in the state. I do not believe it would be proper for Diane to request educational support
            from the legislature. However I do believe a request from your office could spark interest
            in the legislature. There are thousands of Alaskans living and working in our state today
            who are dedicated to living and working here. The are countless others who have educated
            themselves and left Alaska. By offering a loan (or interest) forgiveness program to
            Alaskans who w

                                                                 1

             ork and live in Alaska you will INCREASE the educated workforce and PROMOTE new economy in
             our state.



                  As I mentioned before if people were not anchored by debt they may be more willing to
             take chances by opening small business, they would be less likely to leave state for more
             competitive markets/salary, and would be more likely to invest themselves in the future of
             our state. EVERY penny saved would be directed back to our economy in consumer spending,
             capitol investment, and/or charity. Providing Alaskans relief for educational debt
             incurred through our state process can only help grow our state.



                  I would like to reiterate that I do not believe this is a job for Diane Barrans.
             Diane and the commission have worked hard to ensure funding is available to Alaskans this
             is work enough for them.



                 I was however very disappointed by the letter Diane sent me in respone to my message
            to your office. The letter essentially told me about the benifits I am already greatful
            for, expressed details about my account, and left me feeling like I was nicely being told
            to shut up and pay my bill. I understand my educational bills are my own doing. I also
            undrestand that the ACPE works hard to help Alaskans. Because the letter I recieved was so
            pointed I would like to express a few pointed concerns I have with the current program.




             I am currently making a reduced payment of $ 350 per month . That payment only covers the
            interest on my 40k plus loan bill because my interest rate is extremely high. ACPE boasts
            the lowest interest rate available however that is a misleading advertisement . People
            TODAY may have that low interest rate however there are numerouos Alaskans stuck with
            massive interest rates because the rates offered have changed in time. I take advantage of
            auto payments to reduce my interest rate ( I am greatful for that option). I have been
            trying to get on the consolidation program . I am unable to get in that program because my.
            credit score is too low . One major factor of my low credit score is the number of loans I
            have. If my loans were consolidated my credit score would be much higher. Because the
            number of unconsolidated loans is lowering my score I am unable to lower my interest rate
            unless I make 18 on-time payments . I am working on this. I believe people should be
            offered consolidation earlier.

            Consolidation could be provisional for a temporary time, or offered for portions of a
            loan . This would be some relief as people would be paying the actual principal of the
            loan.




              ACPE should offer some form of support for unforseen difficulty. Forebearance is
            difficult, lengthy, and often unnecessary. I am currently switching jobs and will be
            unemployed for a month. When,I called ACPE to discuss this I was told my only options were
            to get a forebearance for 6 months and that I was ineligible to do that if I could not
            prove income. I would only be eligibel if I defaulted my loans!!!! When I called my
            federal consolidation loan processor they assisted me by adjusting my payment schedule and
            offering me a month grace period. It was a simple and easy process that allowed me to
            continue paying on-time. The ACPE processes are more difficult. I am given the option to
            take months off, keep paying, or default my loan. I do not understand why it is so
            difficult to support the consumer in difficult times with a simple month grace period, by
                                                          2

             altering the payment schedule.




            I would like to close this letter by urging you to consider supporting the growth and
            development of our educated workforce by creating a loan forgiveness program for Alaska.
            Here qare a few suggestions : The program could allow Alaskans who are PFD eligible to pay
            the entire principal and be forgiven the compound interest . The program could forgive the
            entire loan .. The program could allow Alaskans to offer their PFD in exchange for loan
            forgiveness . People who participate could be required to provide service to Alaska for a
            set time after participating to ensure they remain in Alaska and support the state. There
            are many ways to develop such a program . I would be happy to assist your office (or any
            legislators interested ) shoudi you wish to consult me. Please condiser this. Why not
            invest our state surplus in our greatest resource , OUR FUTURE ! OUR PEOPLE!!!



            Thank you for your time

               Governor,

               With all due respect- I believe there's some confusion as to who had access to your computers and the
               House. It was not the investigator, but our guys in the Dept Of Law who requested the information to
               preserve it in advance- before the investigators have access to it.

               Had it been the investigators, I certainly wouldn't let them just walk in unaccompanied- eapecially not your
               bedroom. Kami is the IT gat who works on your computers on a regular basis.

               Although it's still intrusive, it's better that they came in and not one of the investigators and that Dept. Of
               Law has secured the hard drive copies.

               can't believe there are no policies in place that address this- or they did not follow policy.

               It was only Kami Clark who went into the master bedroom and Todd's office and she was only at each of the
               desks to have access to the computers.

               To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd floor.

               time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned back to the house. All
               of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

                Governor,

                With all due respect- I believe there's some confusion. as to who had access to your computers and the
                House. It was not the investigator , but our guys in the Dept Of Law who requested the information to
                preserve it in advance- before the investigators have access to it.

                Had it been the investigators , I certainly wouldn 't let them just walk in unaccompanied -. eapecially not your
                bedroom. Kami is the IT gal who works on your computers on a regular basis.

               Although it's still intrusive, its better that they came in and not one of the investigators and that Dept. Of
               Law has secured the hard drive copies.

               No I'm just letting you know that I find it unacceptable that those who are doing the investigation
               do not have to give a head's up before entering the searched person's bedroom to do anything. I
               can't believe there are no policies in place that address this- or they did not follow policy.

              It's unacceptable that whomever is in charge of this "investigation" did not inform me nor grant
              my approval before proceeding. I'm dumbfounded by the way this is developing.

               Governor,

               I had understood, although incorrectly , that you were aware that this was taking place . I apologize for not keeping
               you informed, I'll make sure that I communicate with you directly.

               I wanted you to be aware that it was Diane and I, not IT staff that moved everything off of your desk. This was
               before we knew that you were returning to the House to pack and we had already begun to prep for the plumbing
               project.

               I can certainly understand your frustration with this and will be more diligent at keeping you informed.

               Thank you,
               Erika

               Governor,

               It was only Kami Clark who went into the master bedroom and Todd's office and she was only at each of the
               desks to have access to the computers.

               To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd floor.

               No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as it's not comforting
               at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who went to the
               bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th event that occurred
               while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

               Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor 's office computer folks and
               they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the
               time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
               of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

               If anyone has an answer, pis let me know asap:
               I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails from
               computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were
               the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it was that
               this occurred. Thank you
