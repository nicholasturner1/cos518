           If we shoot for 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, that should give you plenty of wiggle room (prep and
           travel time) between that and the Export Awards ceremony, which is supposed to conclude
           around 1:30 p.m. I'll have the Marine speech and event info to you later on today,
           Governor.  Have a great Memorial Day weekend:)

            Janice just called me a little bit ago; the Marines called her today and it sounds like
            most of them are now shipping off Weds morning so they'd like to do this Tues mid
            afternoon . She will be sending an email w / the exact details. I'll be sure that we have
            pins ready and any thing else I can think of.

             In doing the Marine's talk before deployment next week let's make sure we have pins
            and/or other things to present them. Also, did they confirm that next week is the best
            time for the 48 soldiers?
