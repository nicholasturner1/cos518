              Dear Ms. Pepi - Thank you for your email expressing concern about funding for a Kasilof River Boat
              launch. As you know, Governor Palin has included $2 million in her FY2009 capital budget for this
              purpose. The governor recognizes that sport fishing is an important component of the economy and
              quality of life on the Kenai Peninsula and boating access is an essential aspect of providing sport fishing
              opportunity. The legislature is currently considering this funding request and public input is an
              important part of the budget process. House and Senate Finance committees have been carefully
              reviewing the budget and will have scheduled time for public comment. I would encourage you to
              provide written or oral testimony to the finance committees.

              Should this funding be included in the budget, the Department of Fish & Game is committed to
              conducting a public process. The department's Statewide Boating Access Coordinator is working with
              Department of Natural Resources staff to hire a consulting firm to conduct a feasibility study for the
              boat launch project. The contract will include conducting public hearings, developing a concept level
              design, construction cost estimates, annual and long term maintenance costs, permitting requirements,
              and identifying archaeological/historical issues. There are two sites that will be evaluated under this
              contract, Trujillo's Landing and Foxhill Estates Subdivision.

             I would also encourage you to keep in touch with Charles Swanton, Director of Sport Fish, who is the
             best source of information on this project. Charlie can be reached at 465-6184 or
             charles.swanton(cr^ aska.gov.

             I object to the state using the Trujillo parcel for a public boat launch and parking area. I live in the
             residential subdivision between that parcel and the state highway, and I would be severely affected by
             this decision. Our roads are over 30 years old and were never designed to handle that much traffic, and
             still provide safety and accessibility for our homeowners and children playing outside.

             The Kasilof river currently has a very limited motorized boat us, due to river conditions. It is primarily a
             drift boat fishery, and I believe it is not allowed to fish from any motorized boat as well. Why provide
             access for power boats, then? The ADF&G uses a boat equipped with a jet drive and this boat can be
             heard quite clearly and loudly in my yard, 2 blocks from the river! The Kenai river is now addressing
             water quality issues of pollution from hydrocarbons, as well as noise and bank erosion from the boat
             traffic there. Should we not know the impact this may have on a much smaller river, before that damage
             is done here?

             There has been no public process or notification, and our neighbors are very concerned about the impact
             this would have for us.
             I ask you to please deny funding for this bill.

             Thank you, Laurinda Pepi
