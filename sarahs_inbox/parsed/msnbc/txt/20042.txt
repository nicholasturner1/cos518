          Ok.

          Sounds like we should have chimed in on the Wall St Journal interview,

          as Hollis talks about impeachment in the article... makes it all sound

         horrible.

           The lighting is probably better in the capitol office if that's better

          for KTUU's tech guy today. Unless he's bringing all his own lights I

          don't know how they'll work it at the house.
