        Okay, I'll fill you in when you get here.




        Crap about the luggage. Bob just called me; according to Northwest there is a 50/50 chance
        your luggage will arrive on the 10am flight this morning. The airline is supposed to
        notify us once the plane arrives.

       Pls let me know where everyone is on this before i respond to mike. He has a different
       take on this than others. I'll see you in a bit and we can chat then. My luggage didnt
       make it, so i may have to try to track it down this AM and the airline had better deliver
       it to me - there's no time to go back to airport once northwest finds it. Bristol's made
       it tho!
