            Rosanne and Sharon- would you make sure Wesley and others reporters have all the info they
            need re: the REASONS for individual vetoes and "move to Capitol" listings.



            For instance, $lomillion Port of Anchorage vetoed because it's taken care of when we put
            the money in the bond package.



            $5million Palmer-Wasilla Hwy, vetoed because DOT has it pegged for their next year's
            budget, they can't spend it this go 'round.



            Kasilof boat ramp , $1.2million because its district senators / reps requested it be pulled
            until they have public hearings on it... Etc



            All good reasons, but reporters have already skipped coverage of that important part of
            the announcement. Thanks
