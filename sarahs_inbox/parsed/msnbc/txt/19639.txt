            Ladies,

            I sent this to Janice and Jessica on 6.6.08, I have added Nikki since RM wants to be
            included in native issues.

            MESSAGE:




            I was just wondering who the Karluk IRA Traditional Council can contact regarding the
            Kodiak Island Housing Authority? There are many issues that our community has regarding
            this organization and has had for years. We are not being heard and feel that the unfair
            treatment of our community members must stop




            Please respond as soon as possible. This is our second email and we have not been
            contacted yet




                                                                1
