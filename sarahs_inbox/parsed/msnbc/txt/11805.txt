            I am sending this to Sharon Busch also, so she can send an autographed photo.

            Dear Sarah Palin




            I'm 24 and a lifelong Seward resident. I have been looking forward to your appearance at
            today's Iditarod Celebration all month. Unfortunately I completely spaced out and missed
            it. I rushed down there at 2pm but you we're already long gone. Despite the howling wind,
            i heard there was a good turnout. I just wish i could have been there. I would have
                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01 0011311
