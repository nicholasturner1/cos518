          Dear Governor:




          I recently read in a blog by Dr. Albert Mohler of your new born son, Trig Paxson Van
          Palin.  Thank you for standing firm on his right to live and thank you for the committment
          that you and your family have made to raise this special child. May God's blesing follow
          you and your family.



          Sincerely,

          Mark Dickinson
