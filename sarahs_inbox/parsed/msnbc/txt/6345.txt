        still had to spend 40 days in Camp Shelby. rnrnlf you respond to this, I will be happy to
        give you any details you want, about our poor taining and our deployment in general.rnrnl
        have some pitures of you during your meeting with us and a couple unique Alaska in Kuwait
        pictures if you would like them.rnrnThanks again,rnrnKeith HodsonrnNew Stuyahok,AK
