              Never mind about the valley clinic- I see they're already set for Anchorage. But again,
              give me a second to decide if I want the shot. And I will read the proclamation.

              Tomorrow, Wednesday, 11.21 you will be giving remarks at the Alaska Tip-Off Luncheon.
              They have reserved a seat for you and one guest. Please let me know who you will be
              bringing and if not I will call ahead and let them know not to reserve two seats.



              On Monday. 11.26.07 you will be reading the Proclamation and giving short remarks for the
              Flu Shot Event. DHSS is asking how you would like the question answered "why you are not
              getting a flu shot." They are certain that this will be asked. They would like to know
              if you do get flu shots. This event has not been advertised yet - Kris and I have
              discussed and think that you wilanarl nr Parcnnal Ma4arial Rarlar4arl

              Your Brother would like to bring 10-15 kids by one afternoon to the ANC Governor's office
              to meet and ask some questions @ 4:00 p.m. I·have put this on your calendar for Tuesday,
              December 4 as they are asking if the Lt. Governor would also be available and this will
              fit in his schedule too.



             Thank you and I hope you and your family have a Wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday, Janice
