          Well, you know, they have budget pressures . The profit margins weren't high

          enough and so Alaska should, of course , pay for the fact that they simply

          had to cut somewhere .      Can't Alaska residents understand that we should all

          subsidize maintenance of their pipes in cost-cutting times - even after the

          state's environment was threatened and damaged ,           revenues fell short for lack

          of oil moving through the pipes ,        and BP' s lies are hurting Alaska's national

          efforts to further develop lands? (I certainly hope the sarcasm can be

          felt.)



          Thank you for passing along. I haven't found the BP committee hearings on

          television.
