            Thanks . Also , when asked about the Gravina Bridge - I hope like heck lawmakers are smart
            enough to chop that out of the state budget so I don't have to. I believe it may be
            eliminated already by Kyle's colleagues in the house.

            Thanks Governor-



             I have been saying that we support the concept of an energy rebate and are waiting to see
            what will be in the final version of the bill.

            So Bill's bill would result in a surplus check being sent to every Alaskan? Not just
           those in utilities? How can I help push it? I ' ll push that one if Wagoner ' s bill is dead-
           which it sounds like it is.



            Sharon - I'm cc - ing you be I've been asked by reporters about my intentions on Surplus
           Rebate measures - but I have not known status of such latley . I'll see what else I can
           find out today on these so we have a good, definitive answer for press , for Alaskans. Our
           response so far has been right on- whatever we can do to give the resource owners their
                                                                      1

            revenue, thanks to this surplus, we support. But I need to articulate a stronger position
            on it and take more aggressive action before session ends .     Sounds like Bill ' s bill is the
            closest we ' ll come to that this session . Again , if we don't return the funds to Alaskans,
            govt will spend it and that's not something I support.

             HB 396 is Bill Thomas ' measure .     It has been heard twice and is still

             being worked on in the House Finance Committee .         It sounds as if they

             amended the bill in the last hearing to change the payment from an

             additional $ 500 permanent fund earning distribution to a general fund

             surplus payment.



            Wagoner and Therriault have a different version in the Senate Finance

             Committee.     Their bill would make energy payments to the utilities as an

             energy credit that would be reflected on individual's invoices.

            Wagoner's bill has not received a hearing to date.



            Mike

            Where is HB396? If they don't allow one of the many forms of

            energy/surplus dividends this session, I'm afraid it will be too easy

             for them to cont to hold on to the surplus (and ultimately spend it),

            instead of giving back to Alaskans - the resource owners. Which

            legislator(s) controls these measures that could succeed in giving more

            of the surplus to residents instead of govt?

            The House and Senate are both going into sessio at 2 PM. I think much

            is happening this morning.         They usually leave enough time for folks to

            go to morning church.



            I have heard that the Legislature may get done one day early (Sat). I

            do not see how the Senate can leave on friday at this point. They need

            to concur on the capital budget otherwise they are accepting that all

            our projects including the roads, oil and gas, etc. are not needed. If

            the House put the final capital budget on the floor wed/thurs,             sat seems

            possible.



            I plan on trying to get a total spending spreadsheet from Meyer today.

            It will help our discussions with the House.

             Hi guys : do you know what time Hse or Senate meets today ? Wondering if I

             should get things done around here before heading over to the office.



             Nice editorial in the ADN today , pointing out the posturing of leggies

             re: Sp Session and their request for expanded call.



             Talked to a reporter on Friday ' s return flt to Juneau - he said he's

             hearing Senate intends to gavel out on Friday , with or without House's

             completion of work . Does that mean the House finishes up when they need

             to, and it ' s an assumed concurrence by the Senate on the final product

             then?
