              Mike,

              I am checking to see if there is.going to be a response to this email. I wanted to make
              sure I didn't need to do anything else with this email. I did send it to Kris also.

              Hello,

              It's been 10 days since I received this inadequate reply from this

              governor's office. Please reply with an appropriate answer and with the

              reassurance that I will not be getting anymore calls from Ivy Frye from 623
       1
              698-6986 or any other number associated with Ivy. You do realize that Ivy

              called me for the sole purpose to tell me that I better stop blogging on

              ADN. I'm not sure what you are up to Sarah, but I expect a real response

              with an explanation from you.

              Sherry Whitsitne

              MESSAGE:




              Dear Sarah,




              I received an interesting phone call Saturday May 31 6:33pm from one of your

              underling, but also at a high level being your assistant. That is your girl,

              Ivy Fry. To remind you again, I am a private citizen and I can say or blog

              anything I want about you or any other incompetent around you. Ivy didn't
                                                               2




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0019473

              call me to discuss the many issues that Alaska is facing with your lack of

              leadership. I'm sure she called to intimidate me in some way. However, she

              did not succeed. This is the 3rd attempt to contact you about this situation

              since Saturday concerning Ivy Frye ' s inappropriate behavior.



              Question? Was she encouraged by someone to attempt this tactic , or did she

              do it on her own? Please reply with an appropriate answer and with the

              reassurance that I will not be getting anymore calls from young Ivy Fry.




              Sincerely,




                                                             3
