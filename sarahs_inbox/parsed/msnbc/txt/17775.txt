             On a lighter note:

            At yesterday's press conference, Steve Quinn, in the lead up to his question
            on Dan Dickenson's testimony asked if it was the equivalent of "Asking
            Donald Rumsfeld to come back and testify at a hearing on the war in Iraq."
            The room erupted, and the press conference later ended with Bill McAllister
            complaining loudly that Quinn stole his Donald Rumsfeld line.

            After the presser was over, Dave Donaldson, told me he had characterized
            the event to a colleague as "The Empire Strikes Back." He went on to say
            that he thought it was good after the beatings we had taken from the
            producers over the previous week.

            Holy geez - didn't pedro and murk even tout how "wildly profitable" the gasline is, last year?

            How inconsistent can their arguments get?!

             Former Murkowski consultant challenges AGIA

             By STEVE QUINN
             Associated Press Writer


             JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Dan Dickinson, once a tax consultant to former Gov. Frank Murkowski, on Thursday challenged
             the methodology used by Gov. Sarah Palin ' s administration to asses the potential value of a natural gas pipeline to North
             Slope oil and gas producers.

            Polarizing views on the project's value to the producers and what state-sponsored financial assistance is needed go to the
            heart of what's kept Alaska from getting a gas line built. It's a dispute that appears to have no imminent resolution, either.

            Also on Thursday, the administration fended off continuing criticism leveled at Palin's Alaska Gasline Inducement Act by
            producers Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC and ConocoPhillips, which call the bill restrictive and lacking financial incentives.

            The companies are calling for terms that reflect a proposed contract negotiated by Murkowski, which dealt strictly with the
            producers and offered substantial tax benefits.

            But under AGIA, producers and independent pipeline companies can vie for rights to build the pipeline that lawmakers hope
            will ship trillions of cubic feet of natural gas to market.

            On Thursday, Pat Galvin, the state's revenue commissioner, said the administration won't back down.

            "The producers' message has been clear pretty much from the first week," Galvin said. "They say, 'let's go back to the
            negotiating table. The state doesn't need to bring in competition, just come in to talk to us alone.'

            "AGIA's message is clear: to set up competition by providing inducements and to establish what the state's bottom line
            requirements are to be eligible for those inducements. The producers have clearly turned up the volume ... they don't like the
            (requirements)."

            Meanwhile, the appearance of Dickinson, the former Murkowski consultant, before two committees reviewing the bill was
            controversial in itself for his role in backing Murkowski's proposed deal with the producers.

            The Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, which is comprised of state senators and representatives, hired Dickinson. The
            committee has routinely hired consultants to examine a governor's gas line proposals.

            Committee Chairman Rep. Ralph Samuels, R-Anchorage, said he understood the criticism that could come with hiring
            Dickinson. Samuels said he made sure Dickinson has never worked for any of the producers before making the
            recommendation.

            "I know some people might have a problem with it," Samuels said. "But he's got institutional knowledge."

            House Finance Committee co-Chairman Mike Chenault, R-Nikiski, said there was value in Dickinson's presentation, which
            also included the gas line bill's implications on the current production tax system.

           "What it did was show there is lots of ways to figure the value," Chenault said. "He put more information out there and more
           information helps the process. He adds to that.

           "Is he the right person, I don't know, but he's probably one of the more knowledgeable people to talk about this issue."

           Dickinson said the current administration's oil and gas economist, Antony Scott, failed to consider a producer's fmancial

            commitment for shipping the gas in the pipeline. This cost is called firm transportation commitment , or an FT, a term heard
            regularly in gas line hearings.

            Dickinson told the House and Senate finance committees how Scott 's analysis potentially inflates the financial benefits to the
            companies while the administration touts Palin 's Alaska Gasline Inducement Act to lawmakers.

            "(Projects) need to be valued properly," Dickinson said . "When you see extraordinarily high rates of return being suggested
            for this project, it may be because the cost of FT commitments are not being properly evaluated . What I'm challenging are
            numbers that suggest that it is wildly profitable."

            Scott examined the potential value on a $20 billion pipeline project that goes from the North Slope to Alberta , Canada. He
            examined returns for producers as pipeline owners and as shippers of gas, and again as just shippers.

            Three measurements of return were the net present value , which is the current value of future profits; the rate of return; and a
            profitability index . Scott said his analysis omitted no transportation costs.

            "We can't come up with a situation that generates a return of under 10 percent ," Scott said in an interview Thursday . "That's a
            pretty powerful statement."

            Neither Dickinson nor the producers , who shot down Scott's work all week, would present their own figures to counter Scott's
            analysis.

            "I think it's a profitable project. How profitable is certainly arguable, depending on the assumptions ," said Fred Dyson, R-
            Eagle River, who serves on the Senate Finance Committee. "Everything we've seen has shown a very significant rate of
            return."

            In the House Finance Committee hearing , Rep. Les Gara , D-Anchorage, wondered why Dickinson didn't make these
            assertions when the Murkowski administration backed a proposed deal with the producers that included a financial stake in
            the pipeline for Alaska.

            "I guess I would have appreciated somebody telling me last year that when we were doing the FT commitment, that was a big
            risk for us too," Gara said.

            Dickinson said he believed lawmakers were informed.

             Michelle,



            I should first say that this unlike many proclamations may be a controversial one and should be handled with care and
            mindfulness. I recommend that multiple eyes look this over before it is signed.



            This day is not one that is welcomed by Americans United for Separation of Church and State and similar groups that see it
            as a violation of the First Amendment . There are many sites that are dedicated to picking apart both the President 's and many
            Governors' proclamations for the National Day of Prayer as well as the National Day of Prayer Task Force.



            That said I believe it can be worded in a way that decreases the potential for offending any one faith or political affiliation.

            I've attached a draft that you are free to add to , change, or completely scrap.



            I'd be happy to help with anything else you might need . Two other resources would be Stephanie Wheeler our Executive
            Director and Michael Curran our Program Coordinator (and former Episcopal Priest).
