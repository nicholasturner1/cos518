               Leo has made the change on the negotiating team. Hopefully, the state and the airlines will be able to
               reach agreement on terms soon.

               Dear Commissioner:
               I have been asked to forward this letter to you on behalf of the
               listed International carriers.  We truly appreciate all the
               effort put into the finalization of our operating agreement.
               While we are saddened that Frank is no longer part of the
               negotiating team, we thank him for his support and are confident
               that Christine will continue to ensure clarity and transparency
               as we move on. Thank you.
