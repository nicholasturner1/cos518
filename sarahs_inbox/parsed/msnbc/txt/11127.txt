              Ma'am -

              We look forward to your trip down for graduation next week. The FT Benning Protocol
              office is spinning up as it not often the son of an elected official graduates from
              "grunt" school.  Protocol people are the ones that handle making proper arrangements to
              ensure we Army folk don't make ourselves look stupid, kind of like Ms Manners-types. I
              didn't know they existed until the other day. I'm sure over the next few days there will
              be more questions, but I figured I would use our direct line of communication to try and
              get a few of the ones I have now answered.   Otherwise, Track will be calling 2-3 times a
              day as these questions come rolling in.



              Protocol welcomes your family to stay in one of the Distinguished Visitor quarters on FT
              Benning, it's called the Marshall House, named after GEN George Marshall. I believe there
              is 3-4 bedrooms.   Unless you are partial to your current lodging plans, I'd recommend it,
              I hear it's nice. It's the same type of housing that our high ranking officers live in
              while stationed here.   Second, protocol mentioned getting you a car pass that will allow
              you to come and go through the gates without going through the standard identification and
              search procedures.   And the last question is are you flying into Atlanta or Columbus?



              If you have someone on your staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that
              person ' s name and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if
              you'd prefer.



              One final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on Thursday is being pushed
              back.  Family Brief is going to be held at 12:00 and Turning Blue at 1:00pm.



              Respectfully,

                                                            3
