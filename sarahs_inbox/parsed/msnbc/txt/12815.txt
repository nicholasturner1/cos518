          MESSAGE:

          Dear Govonor Palin:



          On Saturday March 1st 2008 I had the unexpected pleasure to not only meet you and shake
          your hand but to also get a great photo.



          I am a licensed dentist in Alaska         (N0. 757) and I follow the ADN paper every day from my
          home office in Tarboro, NC 27886.

          I have admired your work and think your leadership is very good for our state.



          I was in Anchorage to photograph the beginning of the 36 Iditarod. My publisher is
          wwww . alaskacam.com.



          If you object to being in the 2008 Iditarod pictures, please e mail me so I can ask the
          publisher (Jim Gottstein) not to include the photot.



                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01 0013249
