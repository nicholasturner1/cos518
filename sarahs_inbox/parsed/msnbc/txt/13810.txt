                The Bureau of Land Management has just published a public land order making
                82,608 acres near Paxson available for conveyance to the State under the Alaska
                Statehood Act.

                 At least one Alaska reporter has inquired about the BLM decision and the relevant
                 background. So, I wanted you to know.

                The modification of PLO 5150 to recognize the State's previous selections is the
                product of a lengthy planning process initiated several years ago. The State
                originally asked the Secretary of the Interior to release most of the lands in the TAPS
                Corridor on the grounds that they are no longer needed for federal purposes. While
                the 82,608 acres is far less than the State originally sought, it does represent high
                priority acreage for DNR.

                The BLM is unlikely to make additional lands within the TAPS Corridor south of the
                Yukon River available for State selection any time soon. However, it will commence
                a planning process to consider acreage north of the Yukon which the State also
                would like to receive.

                By separate email, I have advised other people within the State administration of the
                BLM's decision.

                Mindy,

               In its present form HB200 is limited to creating a new statutory presumption for those defined firefighters that have
               certification as Firefighter I, with at least 7 years experience within the state and no evidence of the disease at
               each annual exam....

                Hi Kevin,

                Can you briefly tell me the Div . of Risk Management unofficial stance on this bill? This is the bill that would allow workers'
                comp claims in the future for yet undetermined cancers that may have been caused from exposure to yet to be identified
                carcinogens in the line of work. I'm compiling information to prepare Russ for a meeting tomorrow morning (Thurs.) and
                haven't come across any notes from Admin. I don 't need much, just whether or not the CS evokes strong concerns or
                excitement. You can either email or call me, your preference.

                Thanks

                Mindy
