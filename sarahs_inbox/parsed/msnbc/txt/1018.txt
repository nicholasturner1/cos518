Janice - can you send me as well? I will likely be attending as I'm coordinating the 2010 NGA
meeting for potential AK host. Alaska and Massachusetts are the two states in the running for it.
Thanks.

I really need any and all info on philly that you've got- Bristol will need to coordinate her work and
summer school schedule so she can attend, and I'll need to tweak mileage plans for kids tickets.
Thanks
