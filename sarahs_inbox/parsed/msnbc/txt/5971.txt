          I can confirm receipt when I get to work. I am relatively sure it was on the list of
          scheduling items that you and Mike went over at cabinet ..... but it might have come in
          after that.

             FYI:  Tomorrow, Wednesday, June 20, BP Exploration is hosting a reception at the
          Anchorage Museum of History and Art celebrating 30 years of the oil industry's partnership
          with Alaska.  The invitation looks like it is from BP /Alyeska/ConocoPhillips/AOGA. This
          event will be attended by community leaders across the state, and they are hoping the
          Governor might be able to stop by. If so, they were hoping she might be able to say a few
          words.  Time:  6:30-8:30pm.   We've neither regretted or committed the Governor to this
          event.



              Governor: This might come up during your phone calls tomorrow.



              Kari
