         I dont know how your conversations went with Ramras, Joe and Tibs... but AH was on another
         tear this morning using the conversation(s) against us. Maybe Ramras misconstrued the
         content of your conversation(s) and passed it on to AH? Or was there more to the Ramras
         call that I must be missing?



        Also, someone told AH that Tom Irwin directed someone to spend four hours transcribing the
        radio rampage of Ramras' ...he was gleeful about that on the radio this morning... but he
        wasn't being truthful.



        What am I missing here with your convo' s with Ramras?
