              The sched really shows nothing in NY that is pertinent or requiring of my presence. That
              means it's really not necessary for me to be away that many extra days - also means I can
              handle the trip with just the NGA security they provide instead of duplicating personnel
              with my own security. I'm sure someone would tell me if I' m missing something here - but
              no need for NY, and DC security sounds like it's taken care of as it was last year. Thanks
