              Governor,



             The PA's 10 page letter is a public record and was made available yesterday afternoon. It
             was supposed to go up on the AGIA website at some point.



             As you may have noticed, the letter does not identify the specific companies; the
             attachments do.  The attachments have been requested to be treated as confidential.



             Joe

             Is the PA's application made public, along with it's supplement? I assumed it was- hope
             it is- the adn made it sound like it wasn't, per Whitaker's comment.



             The public may comment on all five proposals, nothing stops that, but of course the
             application we're considering is TC's. (For that matter they may comment on CP's, also.).



             Thanks
