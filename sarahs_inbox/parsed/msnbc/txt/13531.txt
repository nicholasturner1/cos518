              Sorry- never mind... There's plenty of room to write on that backside with the verse as
              written. Thank you! It is beautiful and the First Family is honored to get to announce the
              additional member via your talented work!

              Can you eliminate the verbiage from the verse on backside so I can write on that side.
              It's beautiful!

              Working with Kris and Kate we've got this down to a final draft for review.

              Thanks everyone!

              -Andy

              Andy,



              The Governor loved Trig's announcement and the design. Some minor verbiage
              changes /additions:



              Under his picture, add appropriate language from verse, citing Proverbs 3:5-6.



             On the inside, replace Sandburg quote with: The night breeze hums a lullaby - sweet baby,
             you're the reason why.



             Weight should be changed to 6.3lbs and add 18 inches on the length.



             Thanks! Great work.



             Kris

              Attached is the draft announcement ( JPEGS also attached if the PDF doesn't open ).                   There's
              a blank line inside the card for Trig ' s length ( if that ' s something you'd like).



              This was designed to be a card of quarter page in size              ( 4.25 by 5 . 5 when folded ) and would
              look great on a shiny- ish card stock paper.



              Let me know if there is anything we can change.

              -Andy ( and team)

              That photo is so precious . . . and would . work great for a birth announcement.

              If you have thoughts about text for a printed announcement ... we'd be happy to put
              something together!
