        Sounds great--reminds me of the teen center that Samaritan's Purse volunteers are
        currently building in coordination with Grant Funk's Covenant Church in Hooper Bay--right
        on every kid's way home from school.

       Awesome place. If you hear of potential funding sources send them to Juneau Christian
       Center's Hub.

       Just toured Juneau's HUB... what an awesome place for teens this will be! Said I'd do all
       I could to help find funds (they need $500g more to open), esp since I vetoed state funds
       for it - be of the church relationship.



       If we get a chance to put a plug in for the HUB with Rasmussen or other funders, let's do
       so. Thanks
