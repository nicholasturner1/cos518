           Governor - You may already have this info,          but here's the message I

            forwarded to Russ, Anna, and Mike T. on this earlier.

           These are the statements DHSS has been making about SB160 since it was

           introduced last year:



                                                                 1

            DHSS supports the underlying premise of SB160 - health care for all

            Alaskan.    However, health insurance and access to actual health care are

            not the same thing and SB160 may not necessarily achieve the goal of

            health care for all Alaskans.        Because DHSS lacks the actuarial

            expertise and data to comprehensively analyze SB160, we can only speak

            to support for the goal of health care for all Alaskans.



            Bill Streur is passionate about achieving health care for all Alaskans.

            That's what he spoke to in his testimony yesterday. When he was asked

            for his personal opinion about SB160 based on his past experience and

            knowledge of health care issues , he was clear in stating that he was not

            speaking from a department or administration position.



            When the press release reported "the department has recently formulated

            a position on the legislation", it sounded as though our position has

            changed .   It has not.
