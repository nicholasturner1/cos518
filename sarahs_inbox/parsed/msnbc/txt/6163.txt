        Ya' gotta trust me on some of these things Tibbles!



       Also, you've had the day to think about my recommendations for personnel changes - are you
       ready to move in that direction?

         We also need to hustle on Rural Affairs advisor. Was Marie Green once in admin? She may

         with today in Kotzebue.
