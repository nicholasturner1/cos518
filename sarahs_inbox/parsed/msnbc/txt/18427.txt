         In roll out we need to thank leggies for killing murk's gasline deal. Had they adopted it
         we'd have killed all opportunity to fix oil tax problems for 35 years.

         Sharon- pls correct Regan Scott's KTVA story last nite on Murkowski's comments re: her
         fears for gasline. Regan said "applications weren't coming in, so they pushed AGIA
         deadline back..." It was a cluster of a report she gave and Lisa's comments played right
         into Regan's story. Thanks. Remind Regan why AGIA deadline was pushed, and that apps arent
         supposed to come in 'til the last minute. Joe can help with the correction.
