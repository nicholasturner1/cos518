            Governor:



            Just after I e-mailed you, Mayor Herb Pond from Prince Rupert called.  He said he was
            somewhat embarrassed by the situation and that the City of Prince Rupert will repair the
            dock at their expense . He said the cost will be about $1 million and their goal is to
            have the dock fixed by Memorial Day.



            I am working on setting up a meeting between the Mayor and the DOT engineer and DOT shore-
            side supervisor who are traveling to Prince Rupert.   They can visit and inspect the dock
            and the Mayor can explain his plans for repairs to them. They can then brief the
            Commissioner and the rest of us on Sunday.



            Randy

            Thank you Randy. Glad we're demanding they uphold the lease agreement.

            Subject: AMHS / Prince Rupert Dock




            Governor :



            We received notice late yesterday that the City of Prince Rupert , British Columbia, has
            closed the dock it leased to AMHS for repairs . AMHS has had some concerns about the dock
            and asked Prince Rupert as the landlord to get a survey done . When the survey came in it
            showed some significant problems.



            AMHS has been scrambling ever since .   We have received permission from the BC Ferry system
            to use their dock which is fairly close by .   Commissioner Von Scheben has sent an engineer
            and a shore - side dock expert to Prince Rupert to assess the situation and make sure our
            vessels can use the BC Ferry System dock .   The first AMHS vessel will attempt to use the
            dock at 3 : 00 am Sunday night . We are meeting on Sunday to hear the results and discuss
            options.



           The Department of Law is sending a demand letter to the City of Prince Rupert to comply
           with the lease terms to maintain the dock and fix it as soon as possible.



           DOT's communications officer , Roger Wetherell , is issuing a press release and handling
           press inquiries.



           I will keep you updated as events unfold.



           Randy
