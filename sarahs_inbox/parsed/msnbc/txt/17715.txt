        Don't know if you saw this article, this morning. With your trip north this week, it
        might be nice to shake hands with Mayor Isaacson and personally thank him. And then I
        would suggest a meeting with Mayor Steve Thompson who said he wants a better understanding
        of the legislation before weighing in. Any thoughts on this?

                                                                  1

         North Pole mayor backs pipeline bill



         By Chris Eshleman

          Published May 1, 2007




         Mayor Doug Isaacson and North Pole City Council members have come out in support of Gov.
         Sarah Palin ' s Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, which lays out incentives aimed at spurring
         construction of a natural gas pipeline.



         Isaacson said he supports Palin ' s approach toward building a pipeline . Her gas team's
         style is a change from that of previous state officials who had proposed " surrendering"
         the state ' s interests to those of the oil companies , he said.



        "This governor is thinking of ways to push for a fair pipeline ," Isaacson said . "We need
        to push forward . Now's the time , the window of opportunity is not getting any longer."




        The city of Fairbanks and the Fairbanks North Star Borough have not taken official stances
        on Palin's plan.



        Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Jim Whitaker has openly supported Palin ' s approach
        toward spurring pipeline construction and said a couple of Borough Assembly members have
        commented that a statement of support could be " appropriate ." Whitaker is also chairman of
        the Alaska Gasline Port Authority, a governmental entity of the Fairbanks and North Slope
        boroughs and the city of Valdez that is proposing to build the gas line.
