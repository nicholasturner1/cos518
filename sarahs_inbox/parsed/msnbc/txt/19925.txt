               Yes, we can meet later... sounds like the most important thing at this time with kabata though is
               to let the public know the status of our question/seeking answers process. It's been left up in the
               air and I'm sure folks are getting anxious for us to speak to the issue . It doesn't have to be done
               today but at some point in near future. Thanks

               Governor.

               Could we meet later in the afternoon ? I have a committee hearing in House Finance this morning on the
               motor fuels tax. Thanks.

               On the project, once the independent review the FHWA and State need to move the project forward is
               done (this fall) and we get solid numbers not just in costs but in potential revenue from tolls, we
               should evaluate the project

               The 2 developers involved right now are not offering very good terms. One lost a lot of money on a
               project in Miami and I think is trying to cover all the risks it ran into in Miami in its proposed draft RFP
               terms for the Knik Arm project.
