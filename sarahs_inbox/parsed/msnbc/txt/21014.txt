               from the 'deadliest catch group." This would be going to Unalaska (Dutch Harbor). Janice

               Governor - This request has come in for you to attend on Sunday, August 26 in Sarasota,
               Florida. This is with the "deadliest catch" group. I did not know your availability as you were
               going to go from Anchorage to Sitka on Monday, August 27. Please let me know if you would
               like to do this. Thanks, Janice

               Good morning Janice,

              I wanted to let you know that Alaska Brewing company has now donated Alaska Beer for our
              Charity event, so it is truly going to be a full on Alaska dinnerll It's fantastic.

              Menu will be : Smoke Alaska Black Cod Croquette, Salad, Bristol Bay Red King Crab, and Baked
              Alaska for dessert.

              We will be donating everything to the childrens Charity including proceeds from t-shirts and
              pictures autographed by the skippers that afternoon. We are closing down Main Street in
              Sarasota for the autograph session, and will have music and beverages. At the dinner we will
              have a live auction with the premier item being a trip for 2 up to Dutch Harbor on our annual Crab
              Connoisseur Tour in October which will be October 27 - 29th. This will be bringing the lucky
              bidder along with 50+ Chefs and Retailers from all over the country up to Dutch fro the opener of
              the 2007 Red King Crab fishery.

              Everyone would really love to see Governor Palin in Sarasota . Phil, Johnathan , Andy, Keith and
              Larry would love to have her attend . Senator Bennett from Florida has also asked if the Governor
              will be able to attend.

              This would really put the bow on the package if it is possible. Please contact me if you have any
              questions.
