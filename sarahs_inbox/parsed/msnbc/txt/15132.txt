            Governor,



            What do you think about donating a book on engineering or bridges to the Birchwood ABC
            Elementary School library tomorrow? If you'd like to do so, one of us would leave now to
            go purchase a book. It's a very cool event in that it's encouraging Math, Science &
            Engineering in Alaska's youth; plus, Alaska is such a geographically diverse state, we are
            entirely dependent on bridges - we couldn't leave Anchorage to get to the Valley,
            Fairbanks, or Soldotna without bridges!   Please let me know if you'd like us to purchase
            such a book. Thanks!
