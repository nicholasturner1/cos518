            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            Congratulations on writing that letter to that worthless ass, Senator Harry Reid.                 You are
            most definitely one of my heroes.




            Please keep up the good work and stay in the news, so your name will become better known
            nationally.  You'd make a terrific vice president.




            Respectfully,




                                                                 1




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0019796
