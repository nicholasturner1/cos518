                 Subject: Mayor Joe Williams

             Gov's office here had a call from Ketchikan Borough Mayor Joe William's office. He wants to speak to the
             Governor asap. I called to get some follow up and the Mayor's currently in a press conference on Gravina. Their
             news director will give us a call or send us any press release, points, etc that they have which I'll forward as soon
             as I get. His # is 254-0134, but I hope to have more details shortly.
