           Governor - I just received the notification of the graveside service for Private First Class Jessy S. Rogers of
           Copper Center. The service will be held Monday, August 6 a 2:30 p.m. It will be at the Ft. Richardson
           Cemetery. The family is aware that you may be attending (this has not been confirmed). This is listed on your
           calendar with driving directions. Thank you, Janice
