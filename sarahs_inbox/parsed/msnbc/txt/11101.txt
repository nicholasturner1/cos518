                 Governor,

                 This may sound confusing, so hang in there with me - We have a 1) drop
                 out rate and we have an 2) on-time graduation rate.

                 The FY07 drop out rate in grades 7-12 was 5.47% (3,434 kids)
                 The FY06 drop out rate in grades 7-12 was 5.8% (3,642 kids)
                 The FY05 drop out rate in grades 7-12 was 6.0% (3,791 kids)

                 So, Alaska's drop out rate is decreasing, slowly. Drop outs could be
                 kids who leave school to get a GED, leave the public school system
                 altogether, or are pulled out of school to be homeschooled,
                 independently at home, not associated with any public or private school.
                 We are losing too many kids annually.


                 The Alaska on-time graduation rate is calculated by looking at the kids
                 who enter High School in 9th grade and graduate 4 years later, on-time.

                The FY07 on-time graduation rate was 62.95%
                The FY06 on-time graduation rate was 61.59%
                The FY05 on-time graduation rate was 61.35%

                So, Alaska's on-time graduation rate is increasing , slightly. The
                national on-time graduation rate is around 72%.

                I hope this helps - if it doesn't, or you need more information, please
                let me know. Thanks! BAT

                 Hi Barbara: for state of the state address - what's a safe # to claim as
                 our "drop out" rate that we're trying to slash.

                 You've done this before with your staff, but you're going to want to watch your time so you
                 know when you have to turn a draft into Beth (or someone else) so you get it on the teleprompter
                 and so she has time to to clean it up for distribution. The trick will be to give your staff plenty of
                 time to clean up the "&" "w/" "applause" and other shorthand typing in the speech, but not
                 enough time so they inundate you with changes. Don't know if you'll do it this time or not but
                 often the governor's staff will distribute a copy of the speech as you're going into the chambers or
                 just ahead of that moment.
