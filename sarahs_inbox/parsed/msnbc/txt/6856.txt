             Subject: Labor Rally May 3 in Juneau

           GGU, Supervisors and CEA (ASEA and APEA) unions will have a "Show you Care"
           rally on the 8th Floor outside deck of the State Office Building in Juneau Thursday,
           May 3 at noon. Concurrently, the National Day of Prayer will be happening on the
           Capitol steps.

           I want to be sure you know that the State has been bargaining seriously and fairly. I
           have personally met with the Union leadership of ASEA and APEA and their
           bargaining teams to express that Governor Palin wants a contract and I want a
           contract. We want the best and brightest employees for the State, we are concerned
           about recruitment and retention and will be working to identify the factors
           contributing to this issue. I am not yet convinced that salary is solely responsible for
           the recruitment and retention pressures the State is currently facing.

           A federal mediator has been meeting with our bargaining teams and the union
           bargaining teams this week. I believe progress is being made, based on the reports I
           get from our teams.

           Let me know if you have questions.
