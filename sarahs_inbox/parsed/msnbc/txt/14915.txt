           MESSAGE:

           I am the mayor of a small town here in South Carolina. I have a precious grandson who was
           born with Down syndrome. My daughter-in-law has a blog that she updates frequently. I
           thought I would share the link with you so you could see what a blessing Carpenter Long,
           3, has been to our lives. He is the 2nd of 4 children. My son, Jonathan, is his father.



           The blog:    www.longsjoyfuljourney.blogspot.com



           Hope you enjoy and we will keep you in our prayers!
