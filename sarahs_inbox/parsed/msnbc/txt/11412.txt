                       Senate Dear Colleague Letter


                       This letter HAS NOT been sent, and we are still looking for co-signers . Here it the latest info from Tin

                       Here are our current list of signers on our letter and the folks we are targeting. Any help the
                       folks could provide in pushing the targets onto the letter would be greatly appreciated. For it
                       we don't have Senator Cantwell (WA) yet. On top of that, I talked to Senator Snowe's (ME)
                       today and they said she' s leaning no because they don't see it as much of an issue in Maine. I
                       voicemail with Curtis Picard right away.

                       I also sent this list to Michael Dendas with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said they're
                       a 2pm conference call to talk about this.

                       Thanks, Greg
