              Hi Karl,
              Can you please check the schedule to see if the Governor is going to be in Anchorage
              or Mat-Su this Friday June 22nd. There is a funeral set for long time resident Barry
              Perkins who passed away on June 17th.

              There will be a military grave service at Ft. Rich at 1:00pm then a gathering at 4:00pm
              at the American Legion Susitna Valley Post 35 located at Mile 46 on the Parks Highway,
              Wasilla. We should have someone attend if the Governor's schedule will not permit her
              attendance. Let me know if you need me or Mark to attend.

              Thanks,
              Colleen
