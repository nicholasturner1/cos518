            Thank you and we need to do something here soon to restore trust with our troopers . I am anxious to meet with
            Wait after session . We have some bad apples out there and I can't believe the threat of union grievances and
            complaints would keep us from getting our own house in order.

            Mike

            well Mike - between this and the message I received the other night where an Ak State Trooper recently
            told a friend of family that he could further "mess with the governor' s sister" by claiming falsehoods
            about us - well - some of our "finest" in uniform continue to disappoint.

            I am cc-ing Walt on this.
