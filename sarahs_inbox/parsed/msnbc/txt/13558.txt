             Subject:                 Pressure on Tires


            Pls cont to put pressure on Kookesh and everyone else on tire tax repeal. Amazing that I
            have so few bills that were even introduced the past two years, and they're all good for
            AK, but even more amazing is that we're not succeeding with some of these even after
            giving up so much to the lawmakers. Seems a lot of actions have been one-way negotiations
            where they're winning their projects and bills, but we're still not getting the few and
            far-between requests I've had: tire tax, small business fees , CON, predator control, etc.
            Are we not pushing hard enough, but instead seeming to cave to their wants?
