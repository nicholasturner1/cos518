               Governor, when time allows, I would like you to consider a much longer discussion with us about the direction of
               the gasline decision . I imagine it would be a lot like the ACES discussion on gross vs . net. We need to hear
               more of your thoughts/ideas and you should get a greater insight into what we are seeing so we really have a
               team approach /decision . Thanks, Tom
