  Hi Todd,
  Sorry I didn't have the numbers for you when you asked, but here are the average costs for the basics.
  The prices are all going up, so next year will most likely show an increase.

  Average monthly utility costs:

  Electricity               $1,040

  Water and Sewage              279

  Garbage                       76

  Nat'l Gas/Propane             100

  Heating Oil                2,450
