         We're still having today's Thomas/Wilson mtg, right? Via telephone? And were they told I
         had to stay in Anchorage for the ppt roll-out meetings but wanted to know if they could
         fly up here instead of Juneau for our scheduled mtg? If not, I assumed we'd do it
         telephonically so they're not offened that I couldn't meet them in Juneau.



        Also, Janice- would you contact Nueman, let him know I'm available for telephonic mtg next
        week (or early this morning or sometime tomorrow) as we're packed with ppt mtgs until
        Tuesday. He'd requested a visit recently, I was told.



         I can get to Juneau Tuesday after press conf so sched can reflect that.



        Mike- we need to have presser in a more creative and friendlier spot than conference room
        so I'll ask comm folks to be thinking of location - I dont have Beth's email pls let her
        know of my intentions.
