            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your new son! I am also a proud mother of a son (Caleb 23
            months) with Down syndrome. He is our third child and second son. He is a complete
            blessing in our life and regardless of what you hear from doctors or therapist children
            with DS are amazing and very capable. My son starting walking at 18 months, he is talking
            about 10 words now and loves to play with his brother and sister. Please know that my
            husband I are praying for you and your new son Trig. May I suggest reading Gifts: How
            Children with Down Syndrome Have Enriched Our Lives by Kathryn Lynard Soper.   It is a
            wonderful book that opened my heart to how special and amazing these children really are
            and see beyond the many challenges.



           Many Blessing,



           Charlie and Lori Couch
