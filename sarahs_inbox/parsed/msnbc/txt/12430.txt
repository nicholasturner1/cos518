           Pls add this:



           And we need to slam their efforts here ,        incl SB80 last year that they stalled.

           These sentiments should be in a presser - the legislature is tearing the rug out of my
           efforts to prove our ability and committment to the oversight that ' s needed before anyone
           can trust that ramped-up development of our resources should happen.

           Sharon - I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault ' s taking out PSIO positions and BP corrosion
           lawsuit funds out of my budget . Im back here in DC speaking with Cneney ( sat with him the
           entire State dinner last night ), will try to speak w/ Bush today ... speaking with national
           reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide sound oversight
           of resource development , as evidenced by PSIO , lawsuits to hold industry ' s feet to the
           fire re : waste of valuable natural resources , etc... and here while I'm away I find out
           the legislature may undermine those efforts ?    It's unacceptable if the nation is to
           believe we ' re capable of responsible , ethcial ramped up development that's need in our
           state , for our nation.
