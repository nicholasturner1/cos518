             MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful son. I also have a child with Down
            Syndrome.   I was married before and had 3 adopted children (all siblings) who are now in
            their 20's.   I remarried, and experienced my first natural pregnancy at the age of 46.
            Eric was born at 31 weeks gestation. He was a tiny 3lbs-2oz. He spent 41 days in the
            NICU but thankfully, he did very well. He wasn't diagnosed with Down Syndrome until he
            was 3 weeks old. And even though I am a pediatric nurse, I was scared, sad, and
            overwhelmed. With the support of some excellant doctors, family, and friends, I was able
            to put these feelings aside and just think of Eric as a baby .... my baby. And now my
            "baby" is almost 8 years old. He is the shining star of our family. Everyone is totally
            in love with this young man.... and he is the glue that holds everyone together. We have
            been truly blessed... .as you have been too.

            Enjoy your precious child, and take things as they come. If you ever want to talk, or
            need advice, please e-mail me.



                                                                Sincerely,
