             Sharon:
             We might show up a few minutes early, just in case she's available. The
             House Democrats have a 1 p.m. news conference on the special session at
             the
             LIO. I don't know what they're going to say. Maybe she wants to talk to
             us
             after that instead?
             Thanks,
             Bill
