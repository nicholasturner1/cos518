             The comment was made in a Reuters interview the other day - in the context of answering a
             reporter ' s question on what we can do with Pt Thomson.



             I did say we always have the opportunity to legally challenege producers if they refuse to
             abide by provisions in the leases they've held for 30 yrs, for instance in the case of
             Exxon at Pt T.

             John,



              I read the article and from my base of knowledge the governor's statement is accurate.



             As I indicated previously, Law can talk you through the legal theory but they likely
            can't provide a detailed analysis nor would it be adviseable (in my view only) to do so as
            it would likely divulge legal strategy. The producers know all about their duty to develop
            under the leases--



             I do not know what the context of the governor's remarks was nor what precipitated them
            but I believe her remarks to be accurate. (She's really saying Alaska intends to enforce
            its leases--the state has to live by its agreements in the leases and so should the
            producers.)



             Sean

              I will defer to the Lt. Governor on the legal basis for the Governor's statement.



             Lt. Governor, if you would like, I could contact Marty Rutherford or the Department of
            Law for further elaboration.

              is the Gov on firm legal ground here? Is there a strategy for making this threat?
