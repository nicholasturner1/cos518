             Got a positive phone call from a Fred Sturman, the Vice President of Alliance of Concerned
             Taxpayers on the Peninsula this morning who wanted to pass on to someone "Could you just tell
             the Governor that we think she is doing an absolutely wonderful job? It is so wonderful to see
             someone finally stand up to growing government."
