             MESSAGE:

             Late last month I wrote to request an interview with Governor Palin about the upcoming
             birth of her fifth child for my blog, Scribbit: Motherhood in Alaska.



             Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published a list of the Top Motherhood Blogs and I was
             listed as number five.



             Here is the link to the article:

             I know my audience would love to hear the Governor's views on motherhood in Alaska--could
             I please have a few moments of her time for some questions?



            Sincerely,



            Michelle Mitchell
