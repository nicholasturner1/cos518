          MESSAGE:

          I am delighted with the State Board's decision on Kamishak Special Use Area however I
          would like you to issue an emergency order prohibiting the hunting of any further McNeil
          bears inside Katmai National Preserve. This is such a special place. Please do not
          destroy the balance and turn it in to another like the lower 48.
