             Subject: Justice Clarence Thomas

           Justice Thomas is on Hannity & Combs and is talking about how people try to personally destroy others, their
           character, their image, etc., using his experience before a committee of the US Senate as his real life example.
           He has a new book out. that may be worth a read.
