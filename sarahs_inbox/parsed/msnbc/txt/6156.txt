        Governor -




        On your schedule that has been updated for tomorrow, Wed., 07.11.07, we have you scheduled
        for 1:30 p.m. with Jim Bowles, Conoco Phillips and Commissioner Irwin. This will be in
        your office.




        Also, I spoke with Commissioner Irwin in regards to a meeting request that he would like
        to meet with you sometime Wednesday morning. This would also include Commissioner Galvin.
        They would like to meet for approximately 10-15 minutes in your office. This request is
        the same one that Kris has emailed you previously on.




        Thanks, Janice




                                                                 1
