           Governor Palin Responds to Record Oil Prices




           May 7, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement as
           the price of Alaska North Slope crude oil reached a record level of $123.53 a barrel.




                                                                         1

          "Alaskans are feeling the pinch of high energy costs. The state treasury is swelling
          while the family checkbook is evaporating. As prices continue to rise, we cannot wait for
          medium- and long-term solutions to come into place."




          Each month the price of Alaska crude oil remains over $120 a barrel, the state treasury
          will take in approximately $650 million more than what was forecasted just last month.




          "Since coming into office, we have been taking a methodical approach to long-term
          solutions that will move Alaska's communities off of expensive diesel to cleaner and
          cheaper alternatives.  With today's prices, we don't have the luxury of time. Alaska's
          families, communities and businesses are hurting and we.need relief now."




          When Governor Palin appointed Steve Haagenson as energy coordinator, she directed him to
          lead a team to identify the most efficient and effective ways to reduce the energy cost
          burden on Alaskans. The Governor will unveil the plan to address the short-term energy
          crisis caused by spiking oil prices in the next week.
