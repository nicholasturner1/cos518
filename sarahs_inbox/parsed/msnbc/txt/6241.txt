         Calendar year; however there are on going reporting requirements if circumstances change
         (e.g. Close economic associations).  I will discuss the non-state business requirements
         with Kris in person given our concern about who is listed on the accout.

         We need to make sure we're on schedule with APOC filings on our personal finances and old
         campaign account. Is it fiscal year filing, or calander year?
