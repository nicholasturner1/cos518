             I am very sorry this has slowed down. I, too, like you, left the Dec 6 meeting assuming
             plans were going to go forward to get the energy policy formulated.



             I'll be plugging into this come Monday. Thank you Tom. I sincerely appreciate your good
             work on all this.

             Governor, I wanted you to be aware of a serious problem that I am attempting to resolve
             with Mike.

            Tom,




            Good timing on your question .  I wanted to send an email out to the participant of the
            December 6th meeting ; however I was hoping to visit with Emil in person first.
            Unfortunately, he is not back in state until January 3rd.

             I haven ' t heard anything different or new since our Dec 6 mtg... I'm still of the belief
             we're going to find an " energy czar " to help coordinate all this.



             Unless I ' m missing something, I haven't heard of any changes.

             Governor and mike,  since we last visited on December 6 about the Administration ' s energy
             policy including potential comments for the state of the state , we have been spending
             time evaluating ideas to move an energy plan forward based on what we felt were decisions
                                                                   3




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0009381

             in that meeting.   We haven ' t heard anything directly but we are hearing rumors about
             changes in direction .   If there are changes I think we should have been involved in the
             discussions . What is expected from DNR at this time?     As always we are more than willing.
             to help and I continue to feel this is a crisis .    We have lots of Alaskans really hurting
             from high energy costs .   Thanks. Tom
