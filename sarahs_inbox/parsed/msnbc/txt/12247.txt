            Governor-




            CSPAN would like to know if you would be interested in call-in show on public policy
            Sunday, February 24 at 7 a.m. Do you any thoughts on this either way? - we turned them
            down last year.




            Also, do you have any thoughts on the well baby exam coverage issue? Senator McGuire is
            working on a bill. It's not worth an entire press event but maybe a mention?
