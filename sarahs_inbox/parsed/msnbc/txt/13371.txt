            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,



            Congratulations on the new addition to your family.



            I am writing to urge you to support the appropriations approved by the legislature to
            assist the construction of Fire Island Wind Farm, promotion of renewable energy statewide
            and incentives for home energy efficiency. The cheapest way to produce energy is to save
            it and in the long term the cheapest way to get electricity to villages and the railbelt
            is develop our vase renewable energy resources. This will be a legacy to Alaskans for
            generations to come.



            Sincerely,



            Erik Nielsen, PhD

           .Assistant Professor, Environmental Policy and Planning
