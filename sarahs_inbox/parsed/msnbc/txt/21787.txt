              Hi-




              You have the House to yourself tomorrow, the CCRW won't be decorating and the staff is
              off.  Hope that's a good thing!



             Turn up the heat if it's too cold- thermostats for the 1st floor are in the closet in the
             back stairwell by the kitchen. If it's not heating up call me-might be boiler problems...



             There's a lot of deli meat - but call if you want anything else.

             It's no prob at all for the decorations tomorrow. And the house looks beautiful! I can't
             wait for the kids to see it. Thanks!

                       Hello!



                   That's just not right- who leaves Hawaii early??!!! Good decision though; it would
             be hard to relax and enjoy the sun, warm sand, tropical smells, drinks w little
             umbrellas...  Now you'll just need to go back!! :)



                   It would be cool if they were able to meet up- Alex was all happy when he found out
             you guys would be there-and so close! The kid would probably run 5 miles if he had too,
             he's such a goof!

                     Did you see my note about decorators on Monday (9-4) it's no problem to reschedule,
               but I wanted to check with you before I made any calls.

                      Hi E-

                      I hope Bristol found Alex. I think our hotels are just a few doors down.



                     I hustled back to Juneau early- felt to guilty and nervous being away w/special
               session ... so I'm here . Todd and kids stayed for the wedding that is tonight, they'll
               return to Anchorage late Tuesday. It was flippin' GORGEOUS there!
