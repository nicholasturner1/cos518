            I don't blame him for wanting to bail... something's not quite right with the going's on
            at Kabata. The sooner the better, thanks for getting his letter (hopefully) Monday, if not
            before. With things like this, a very quick departure and transition is best.



            So why now, though, why does he want to go?

           I spoke with George Wuerch last night and he informed me that he will be resigning from
           the KABATA Board.  He would like his effective date to be soon but left that up to us. I
           discussed the option of him sending his letter Monday and his resignation effective the
           end of the month (Wednesday). I am not sure that the timing matters all that much but the
           end of the month option makes sense .  If that is OK with you, I will call him back to
           confirm.



           George feels like his has put his time in on this one.  He said he and Barbara are going
           to travel for a few months and would be unavailable .  Confidentially, he shares some of
          .our concerns about the RFP but he is not going to put out a statement and said he will try
           to avoid any media attention about his departure.
