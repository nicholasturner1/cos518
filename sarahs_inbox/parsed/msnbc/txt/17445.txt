          Nothing has changed since Point Thomson was discussed two weeks ago just prior to and in
          the press availability.  This looks like a repeat of the initial article.



          The unit was placed in default by the previous Admin and that decision was upheld by
          Acting Commissioner Marty Rutherford. It is in litigation and we can't say more except
          we are confident of the state's position.



          Additionally the leases were put into default by Acting Oil and Gas Director Kevin Banks.
          Several lease holders have appealed this decision to the Commissioner of DNR. It is a
          complex issue with some leases over30-years old, 22-plans of development (POD'S), 45-
          leases, numerous owners, an original unit and an expansion unit. As Commissioner I have
          to make a fair informed decision. The extension, to allow for receipt of lease holder
          appeal information, is appropriate to insure the integrity of the process. The apeal
          extension is for 30-days.



          The leases were not extended.



          This is being managed by DNR with continuing support from Dept of Law.  The goal is to
          insure Pt T gas is available for the gas line. We will keep all informed if there are
          changes.



          Also the time spent with Steve Quinn on Monday was very worth while. He now knows I will
          always talk with him. I don't want a no comment statement.



          Please call me at      Privileged d   if anyone needs more or if we can help. Tom

         Exxon Mobil receives Point Thomson extension



         STEVE QUINN

        Associated Press Writer



        JUNEAU, Alaska - Exxon Mobil Corp. has an extra month complete its appeal of

        potential lease termination in the North Slope's Point Thomson oil and gas

         field, the Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday.



        Point Thomson is the North Slope's second largest natural gas field, after

        Prudhoe Bay, and lawmakers have called it vital to the success of a

        prospective gas pipeline.



        The field is estimated to hold about nine trillion cubic feet of gas

        reserves, more than a quarter of the known gas in all North Slope fields.



         "You can't do the pipeline without Point Thomson," said Rep. Ralph Samuels,

        R-Anchorage, who serves on the House Oil and Gas Committee. "It has to be

        resolved either through the court system or make a deal.



        "So if the extension is a sign that they are still trying to work something

        out and get the development done, then that's a good sign. I'm assuming it

        is or they probably wouldn't have done it."



        Because of pending litigation Department of Natural Resources Commissioner

        Tom Irwin said he could not comment. Exxon Mobil officials could not

        immediately be reached for comment.




                                                          7




                                                                                                     PRA_GSP01 _0000922
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com         Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




         The dispute is about 18 months old . Alaska officials ruled in 2005 that

         Exxon Mobil was in default for delaying Point Thomson development by

         submitting a plan without any sure date for production to begin.



         The state threatened to revoke the leases but stayed that decision while

         negotiating a contract with Exxon and two other oil companies for a $25

         billion natural gas pipeline that would take gas from the North Slope to

         Midwestern markets.




         The negotiated contract fell through last year ,          leaving Exxon Mobil with an

        October deadline to update its development plan.



         The plan the company submitted was rejected in November and the state -

         under then Gov. Frank Murkowski - revoked the           leases .   In that plan, Exxon

         Mobil proposed paying the state $20 million and giving up 20,000 acres to

         settle its unmet obligations to develop the gas field. The plan included a

        promise to drill one well in 2009 to better map the extent of the field.



         In December , the resources department under new Gov. Sarah Palin reviewed

        the case and upheld the decision from Murkowski ' s administration the prior

        month.



        This set off numerous court filings from the oil and gas companies and the

        state ,   including the companies requesting a Superior Court to overturn the

        state ' s decision.



        The extension announced Tuesday comes as lawmakers are reviewing Palin's

        Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, which her administration hopes will provide

        the vehicle to ship trillions of cubic feet of natural gas to market.



        Exxon Mobil ,    an Irving, Texas ,    company is among nearly a dozen companies

        interested in the project . The company is Point Thomson ' s field operator for

        45 gas and oil leases shared largely by BP PLC, ConocoPhillips and Chevron

        Corp.
                                                             8




                                                                                                        PRA GSP01_0000923

        Exxon Mobil now has until April 26 to complete paperwork for the appeal and

        provide the state its arguments for retaining the leases.



        Once that has been submitted , Irwin can take as long as he needs to review

        the company ' s materials , said agency spokesman Dan Saddler.



        Granting the extension could illustrate the state ' s effort to resolve the

        issues outside the courts ,       said Sen . Gene Therriault , R-North Pole, who

        serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee.



        "It doesn't help your case if you say no to Exxon for the extension, then

        they say in court, 'Your honor, we made a reasonable request and we were

        denied ,'" Therriault said.
