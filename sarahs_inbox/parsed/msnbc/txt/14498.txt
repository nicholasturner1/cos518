           Sarah,




          I want to thank you for the time you spent at my children's school last week for the Honor
          Society Induction. I was so surprised to see you there and thankful all at once. Your
          speech was very enlightening and supportive to me and my children.




          Thank you for all that you do for Alaska. We are truly fortunate to have you as our
          Governor.




          Carla Smith, P.E.
