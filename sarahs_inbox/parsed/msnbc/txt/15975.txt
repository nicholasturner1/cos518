            Tonight's great for Todd and me - now these type of events can be quite informal and
           still be successful. There's a Costco in Juneau, if you know what I mean. And my family is
           quite capable of setting out food and cleaning up afterwards.

           Great idea ! Please all decide what is best for AGIA. But if time doesn ' t matter
          tonight is better for me. I travel to Anch at noon tomorrow to work on the PT decision.
              Again decide what is best for AGIA.. Tom

            Cool ! We should cook it for whomever needs to have that get-together / reception
          opportunity tonight, tomorrow, or wednesday. I'll let AGIA folks know the fish is a good
          opportunity to have folks over for informal gasline chat.
