             MESSAGE :

             Congratulations on your new family member!



             I really feel you do a great job of representing a great cross section of our State.



            Regarding the Gas Pipeline - Wally Hickel had a really interesting idea of the State of
            Alaska Building the Gas Line ourselves .     ( Anchorage Daily New Editorial page April 20,
            2008 ) I really think we should build it ourselves and keep the line in-state with priority
            use for our State .  I don ' t trust the oil companies offers.



            Best Regards,

            John Cruickshank
