          I would recommend letting them know in the morning (when we also know more) that it is
          likely that the LG will be attending instead.

           All,



           I just got off the phone with Kelly and the LG is happy to cover the event - if he can
          get out of FBX in time . He's stranded there right now.



            Should I call the event contact and cancel for the Govan with the LG as a hopeful backup?

            Last we heard it was still on but will be held indoors and they won't be on motorcycles.
           But with the heavy snow warnings that will affect turnout.
