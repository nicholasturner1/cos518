               Subject: Interior Department/Alaska Advisor

             I received a call today from the Personnel Office at the White House. They are
             renewing the search for a person to fill the job of Senior Advisor for Alaska affairs to
             the Secretary of the Interior. This is Drue Pearce's old position, and it is now being
             filled on an interim basis by Henri Bisson, Deputy Director of the BLM.

             It has been a while since we have discussed this matter internally, and I wonder
             whether you have any names to suggest. I don't at this point, as all of my previous
             recommendations are now employed elsewhere.

             Thanks for considering this.

             Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
             jwka ,alaskadc.org. Thank you.
