        Very well ...I need you to come here soon! They are ready to embrace you in a bigger way--
        just need to bring more familiarity. How about you planning to come here the first week of
        school and you visit every one--including a private school or two??

        Very much so...on Wes.

         Do you want me to bring up character training? I think we're missing the boat by simply
        focusing on ethics.

          We cant afford it, the Feds won't pay for it, the general populace isn't placing it as a
        high priority... can you diplomatically express that?!   Of course we want infrastructure
        - and this is NOT a "bridge to nowhere" (that is so offensive), but as it stands today
        with the highest-cost bridge design selected by the Ketchikan community, we need to find a
        lower-cost alternative is a bridge will be built.

         Don't know if you are reading your BB during the cabinet meeting, but if I get a
       question from the audience at noon (Ketchikan Rotary) about the Ketchikan bridge. What's
       your current view?
