               1. I had several women approach me at church last night and ask me to communicate their thanks for you doing
               the video for the ChangePoint Refresher. They were in the audience during the Refresher and appreciated your
               personal, encouraging words.

               2. The Ear today reported on Halcro 's brother in law at BP. That didn 't come from me or anyone that I know of-
               though I 'm not too sad its out there.

               Hope you guys have a good Iron Dog start and a safe trip!
