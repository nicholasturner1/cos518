                 Subject: RDC speech

               I shared a platform at the RDC conference today with Jim Bowles, Doug Suttles (BP), Mitch
                        (Marathon's new Alaska person ), and an exec from Anadarko. It was a full house at
               the RDC. My speech focused only briefly on ACES, AGIA, and then went to spending policy
               and state permitting challenges (water/mining initiatives), and potential ESA listings (as threats
               to the federal permitting processes).             _

                         e said that under PPT t is year, t ey figure the state would get $3 .4 billion, under
                                                                                                             -crowd.H
               ACES about 4.2 billion, and under the House version about 5.1 billion.

               I did mention publicly that I hoped the legislature would moderate its stance and come back
               closer to your original proposal (though it appears there 's little chance of that happening).
                When Ch 2 asked if you supported the House version , I said that you were pleased with
               progress in the House moving a bill over to the Senate and that the Administration sees this as
               an ongoing conversation until both the House and Senate action is complete.
