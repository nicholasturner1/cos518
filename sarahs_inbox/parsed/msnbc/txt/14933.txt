            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            This morning I read a short article on the internet regarding your precious new baby boy.
            I just wanted to thank you for standing up for what is right during times when so much is
            wrong.  Having a baby God gives to us should never come down to a "decision." The baby is
            a gift we graciously accept with love and humility.



            I am a homeschooling mom in PA and will use you as an example to my girls as a woman in
            leadership who holds fast to what is right.



           God bless you and your dear family,



            Christy Adams
