           Bring this right to Allison then, instead of directing Chuck to someone else in the
           organization. You're right- he'll assume we don't car if he's directed elsewhere. Thanks

           Governor,



           Chuck Hamel has emailed me that last few days regarding his claim that BP is restricting
           the production of oil, causing the state to lose funds .  He claims that BP is shorting
           production 100,000 to 150,000 b/d. I have in the past tried to get Chuck to share more
           evidence of his claims but he has not been forthcoming. I discussed this issue with Pat
           Galvin and he recommended I redirect Chuck to Allison Iverson with PSIO. One problem with
           Chuck is that as soon as he talks to someone , he immediately starts creating an impression
           that they are not doing enough. I know he has mentioned disappointment with Jonne
           Slemmons in the past but Allison maybe a new contact that can help chase down his issues.



          Mike
