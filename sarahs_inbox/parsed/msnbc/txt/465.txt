  Todd, here is some information on NEA for Faye. I don't know much about the group, but there is always
  the internet! I wonder if the Alaska State Library (across the street in the State Office Building) would
  have more information-they have a historical library. Faye might try asking the librarian over there.
  Hope this helps! Erika, maybe you can print this out for Faye, she was wondering about the education
  association in Alaska. Thanks, Karl.
