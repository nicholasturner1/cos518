            This is awesome, governor! Shows how truely conservative you are (we already knew of
            course). I hope lawmakers follow your lead here.

            Hee hee...

            Also, hopefully lawmakers will make the bill even better by eliminating other things like
            portion of state's royalty... we'll encoyrage them to make this even more "generous" for
            the people.

            I'll send to McCain's camp after the presser or bill comes out. They're going to love it!
              And Holly will definitely blog about it. More vp talk is never a bad thing, whether
            you're considering vp or not. I still say President Palin sounds better tho...
