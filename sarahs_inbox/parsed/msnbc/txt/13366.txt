             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the wonderful new addition to your family! I am so sorry you had to
             explain to the public why you chose to fly, but I hope it appeased those kuckleheads!



            When you come to Glennallen/Gakona, I would be happy to babysit!



            You are right, Trig is truely a gift from our Father. May God continue to Bless each and
            everyone of you with Trigs life. Enjoy that new boy!



             Sincerely,

            Mary
