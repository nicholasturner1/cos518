           I just received an email saying that my message/response that I sent an hour ago was
           "undeliverable"...  Hope this time it works!



            K has volleyball, but Brent could get her to the capitol by 4:30pm. to pick up Piper. If
            you want Pip to walk home before that Tom & I could monitor her walking via the sec.
            cameras and she could hang out at the House until K gets here.
