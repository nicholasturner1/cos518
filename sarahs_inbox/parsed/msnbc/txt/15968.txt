           Joe- they're grumpy? All the more reason for them to stop by on friendly ground. Give 'em
           wine and hear their whine.

           And we'll have cupcakes for Doogan's 60th bday- kill              a few birds with one stone.

           We will be opening this with a friendly, casual invite for lawmakers to stop by. Janice
           can shoot out that invite to leggies. For all I know they won't show up- but they need to
           know I welcome them after their day of deliberations.
