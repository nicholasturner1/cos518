  Subject: congratulations

  Congratulations on the birth of Trig Paxson Van Palin. I know that you and Todd had a difficult
  decision to make a few months ago and you did the right thing. I know Trig will require some
  different parenting skills but I have to tell you that Down's children are very special people. The
  don't have a "mean" gene in them. They are the sweetest, most loving, happiest people on the
  planet and every friend I've had that has a child with this special attribute has considered their
  Down's child as a blessing in their life. With your profile, popularity and position, I believe that
  the Palin family will become a poster family for Down's Syndrome, helping the general
  population understand this unique characteristic. Thank you for your leadership and I wish you
  and your family the very best.
  Warmly,

  Brenda Hewitt
