          Thanks Marty!     And that's a funny pic - Kara looks depressed.



          I sure hope you and Kelsey are feeling good. I saw your dad's "new" dock yest in Valdez -
          neat!

         Governor,

         Several things to cheer you up a bit during a tough week:

         1)        Within the past 10 days 3 totally unrelated Alaskans have told me to tell you
         what a great job you are doing! I think you make Alaskans proud to have you at the helm.
         These individuals were:

         a.          My cleaning lady, Shelly Cullumber;

         b.      The woman who took my x-rays during a physical on Monday, in preparation for my
         eye surgery;

         C.       A nurse, as she was rolling me into Providence's day surgery operating room
         yesterday; &

         2)       The attached photo from November 8th, 2006, the day after the general election.
         This is a photo of Kara Moriarty, who works for AOGA, two hours before she gave birth,
         almost a year ago!
