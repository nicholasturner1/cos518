Subject : Spouses' lunch



I still think a legislative spouses' luncheon is a good idea- I'm happy to host it, and Ivy and Kris can
help entertain (!). Kris may want to work the day in the Juneau office anyway on a variety of things.



It could go a long way in building Leg relationships.



Who wants.to take this and run with it? Doesn't have to be a big darn deal, and I'd like it sooner
rather than later. Thanks, all.
