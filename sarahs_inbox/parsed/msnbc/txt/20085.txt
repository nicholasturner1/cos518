           Did the TAs all get completed to more fully explain each trip/event? Dropping them off w
           the other document would be fine inside that side door of the House (we're walking
           downtown right now)

           Governor - I will be dropping off the updated speech for Saturday shortly to the house.
           also received the pile of TA's that were retyped and will need your signature. Do you
           want those brought over or should I just leave here if you will be in this weekend?



           I also am awaiting the Disaster Declaration that once I receive via email will need to
           come into the office to run off in final for your signature. It is looking like it may
           come through later this evening or tomorrow some time .  I will let you know. Thanks,
           Janice
