          How can they say we haven't been responsive? Tom/Marty/Joe: we need to ready to respond to
          any kind of accusation like that, in fact we need to be proactive here and let Alaskans
          know of what we have done, are doing, to provide opportunity for Flint Hills.

          Subject: Flint Hills Refinery/ Koch Announcement -

                 PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL - Attorney Client Privilege




          Representatives of Koch Industries were in DC for a board of = directors meeting a couple
          of weeks ago and met with the Alaska Congression= al Delegation and staff to discuss the
          future of the Flint Hills Refinery.&= nbsp; We are told that Koch intends to make a
          decision about the refinery's= future on or about June 15th.



          These representatives believe that the location differential premium = for state royalty
          oil (averaging $1.08 per barrel between April 2004 to = March 2008) causes the Flint Hills
          Refinery to be unprofitable. They = further allege that the State has been unresponsive
          to their = concerns.



         In the aftermath of the Koch meetings, which I did not know about at = the time, I have
         been involved in an email dialog with Senator Stevens.&nbs= p; Armed with an excellent
         white paper prepared by Kevin Banks (which I = provided to both Senators), I have been
         able to respond to the Senator's = questions. Among other things, I have told him that
         the = location differential, which used to be 15 cents and has been creeping up = for
         several years, will likely be reduced later this year after DNR = completes its audit of
         marine transportation costs.



         Because of the various substantive and political considerations = associated with a
                                                               1

          possible announcement by Koch, I wanted you to be aware = of what has transpired in DC.
          There is not much we can do from here = to help other than to continue responding to
          questions from the Congression= al delegation. But, I wanted to advise you of the current
          situation = in the event that more can or should be done at the Alaska end either to =
          respond to Koch's concerns or to prepare for the announcement.
