             Subject: Vetoes
             I have heard from many of our conservative members here in the valley who would like
             to suggest a few vetoes for your consideration.

               1. Palmer Arts Council- Non-family oriented group, $400,000 for property acquisition.
               2. Anchorage Sports Dome at ChangePoint- $1.5 million for church organization who
                  should consider other sources of funding for project, not state GF.

             Thanks,
             Colleen
