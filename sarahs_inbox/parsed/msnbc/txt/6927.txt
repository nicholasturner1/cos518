          Governor,

          I know it was drafted closely to how the national day of prayer proclamation

         was written. In talking to Michelle Fabrello on this about 2 weeks ago she

          stated that the Office of Faith Based Communities wrote the proclamation;

         that may have been Stephanie Wheeler .            I believe they were trying to be

         diverse and reach out to all Alaskans. (Stan Tucker didn't care for the

         wording either).

        Governor:

         I talked with Mark Campbell who was in Wasilla when Colleen Sullivan-Leonard

        read the proclamation there .          He said pastors in Palmer did not read it

                                                                  1

         because of the passages I conveyed to you in a different email. He had

         already surmised that you had not seen the proclamation and said he would

         convey that message to the Palmer pastors .                Your presence at the Unity

         Sunday service was key in folks being comfortable with this explanation. He

         said they came away confident that it would be rewritten for next year. I

         said I was sure it would.

        Final point,     I promise .     What I wanted to get out of this was a clearer

        picture of who to talk to in this situation. I don't know who would have

        had authority (and time) to get the proclamation changed . Who would you have

        wanted me to talk to?
