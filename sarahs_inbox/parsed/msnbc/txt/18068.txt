         He applied for the board of game. He's willing to serve on anything but has a particular
         interest in fish and game issues.

         Bill,



         I do agree with your sentiment . Sarah should continue as leader of the

         rebellion.




         On of the toughest things I have to overcome in my district 's race is

         being a Republican.

          Part of my doing so is to point out the work I have done for Sarah's

         campaign. If I do so, people will ask where her support is I would like

         to have a good answer.



         I recall with great fondness the primary campaign being part of that

         "rag tag team. Nothing could have ever replaced the efforts or the

        creativity of her volunteers,          it was an amazing.



        Maybe it ' s time those early volunteers mobilize again to continue to

        take on the status quo. I there a reformed minded candidate running

        against Chenault?



        As for keeping in touch with the Governor I have found that in emails

        get forwarded a lot . You never know who reads them.
