  I gave Ted Spraker Ken's cell phone and he said he'd call. He said he had a lot of respect for Ken but
  just found himself on the other side of some of the issues. I guess he used to know him years ago in
  Glenallen when he was working there.

  Fingers crossed... hopefully that conversation goes well.
