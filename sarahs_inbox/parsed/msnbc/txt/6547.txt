         Mr. Arnold - I again apologize. I've been working with our Background Check Unit within in
         our Division of Public Health to resolve these concerns. Based on this e-mail - I can see
         we have additional work to do. I understand telling you, we are hiring two new staff in
         order to be more timely is an inadequate response. We will continue to make very effort to
         remedy this problem. Thank You, Bill Hogan

        Dear Mr. Hogan,



        It has now been over three weeks since I contacted you about this problem

        with licensing, and have not heard back from you. Since then employee V.C.

        clearance came in and it took 38 days. Still waiting for the results of two

        other employees, submitted on 7/19/07 and 7/31/07.              We are critical on staff

        due to the failure of the state to provide timely clearances .                 I feel you

        have had enough time to address this problem and haven't. If we can not get

        any resolutions by friday, 8/17/07, I intend to file a complaint with the

        state ombudsman's office. I'm sorry to have to go this route but our

        residents are suffering because of your departments failure to do their job.



        Sincerely,



        Mark Arnold
                                                                 1




                                                                                                              PRA_GSPO1_0003834

            I'm glad to hear you're doing well! And , no, don 't feel guilty about vacation. Everyone needs down time for
            recharging purposes and for reprioritizing . If you didn't take personal time for you and your family we'd all have
            cause for concem l! So far, it's a fairly slow time for "breaking" stories, and a good time for you to be gone.

            I have only one speaking engagement in the next week (Kenai Chamber). Beforehand, I'll likely show the flag by
            touring some of the Borough and state facilities.

            In our office, (Privileged or Personal Material Redacted            and Jay Pullins and Kris Showalter
            have stepped up to tneir new responsi bilities well as GUS and ucue
                                                                           respectively. You'll see Kris in Juneau full
            time during the session in her Deputy Chief role as she's agreed to live there for the session. We're a
            bit understaffed with two currently in Juneau and four in Anchorage (I had five in Juneau and four in Anchorage
            when I started ), but we're going to stay this way for a few months and save some money . Then, I'll add one back
            in Juneau as we get closer to session and Kris will go down in January.

            That's the news from our end of the tent Enjoy your trip!

            All is well be after picking up Willow from basketball camp in Orgegon , then visiting family there and in WA, we followed
            the sun down here on our own contient - so no hurricane! But I hear I'm missing great weather back home at this time.

            As much as I dreaded leaving AK (feeling guilty about vacation ), it's been great to get away. Track couldn't come with us,
            but this is nearly a full family vacation and it's beautiful.

            Thanks for holding down the fort.

           Are you guys in the path of Hurricane Flossi (Big Island, Hilo or South side)? Hope you have more sun than clouds . Pls keep
           me informed if you change plans or need anything . Just not sure which island you're on . (I called Mice when I read the news
           but I'm not passing it on).
