              MESSAGE:

              Well Governor,




              I just wanted you to know that your accomplishments, passion & ability to lead are making
              waves all the way across the country. I'm a political junkie who keeps his finger on the
              pulse and works with the great radio host Bob Grant.




              I've been spreading the word to my fellow political fanatics that you just may be the
              strongest consideration for McCain's ticket and I do hope that you are given a careful
              look.




              Continued success, love & health with your family and I hope to see you in the national
              spotlight in the very near future.
                                                                    2
