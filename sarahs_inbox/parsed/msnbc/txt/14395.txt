             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin:



             Your leadership by example in standing for life, and receiving with your husband Todd,
             your son Trig as "absolutely perfect" rather than using his Down's syndrome as an excuse
             for denying him life, is a refreshing change from the culture and politics of death, and
             an inspiration to millions like me who value all human life.



             I enthusiastically support you and will pray that God will guard and guide you as you lead
             Alaska in the years to come.
