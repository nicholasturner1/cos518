              Amen.




              And I don ' t know what Lyda's up to but she made this sound like a "gotcha" when she
              presented it to me . I don't want to think the worst, but where was she when her
              constituents were asking for help on this months ago?

             I wanted to remind everyone that Kristan asked DNR to help ask for an audit from LB&A.
             Attached is the letter sent on September 4, 2007. Tom
