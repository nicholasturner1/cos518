           Hi Governor.  Tib thinks we should scrap Nikiski due to the 6-7 hours of your day which
           will be eaten up by driving to Nikiski. Tib and Karen Rehfeld will both be in Anchorage
           to work on the budget with you that day; and the special session could be ending that day
           by noon (requiring possible media).



           Please advise how I should proceed.
