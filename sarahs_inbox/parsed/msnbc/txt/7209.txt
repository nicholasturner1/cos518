         I was advised today by the Department of Defense that there is an excellent likelihood
         that you could visit the mid-East during the week of July 16th.



        If this works, you would fly into DC on Sunday and would travel to the Pentagon on Monday
        morning for briefings. You would then fly, probably on a DoD aircraft, to Kuwait to visit
        Alaska troops.  It is also likely that you would be taken into Iraq for a short visit
        followed by a flight to Germany to visit with wounded troops.



        DoD asks that you block out the full week of July 16th. If you are able to go, they will
        provide additional details soon. In the past, DoD has taken care of everything beginning
        with the briefings on Monday morning and bringing you back to the Pentagon at the end of
        the trip.  All other arrangements are our responsibility.



        General Campbell asked me to determine whether he could accompany you. Unfortunately, the
        answer is in the negative. No Adjutant Generals or gubernatorial staff have been
        permitted on these trips. However, Dan Wilmont, who has been on many similar trips
        previously, would be your escort. In addition, at least one other Governor is expected to
        go.



        Dod needs to know the disposition of Alaska National Guard troops in Kuwait so that
        arrangements can be made for you to see them. Iraq will be more problematic for security
        reasons . DoD says that we should look to General Campbell for information on the location
        of Alaska units you would like to visit.



        In addition, Governors come equipped with lapel pins, flags, and most importantly, coins
                                                               i




                                                                                                          PRA_GSP01_0002212

        to distribute to the troops they visit.     I wasn't involved in this phase of Governor
        Murkowski ' s trip , but General Campbell or Kari Spencer probably know what was done to
        fulfill this need.



        For security reasons , we have been advised to keep our plans to a very small group.
        Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
