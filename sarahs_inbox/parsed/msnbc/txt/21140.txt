        Govenor Paylin, I am a libertarian but I voted for you in the last election. I just
        viewed the bear hunt at the Katmai reserve and I am quite concerned. I believe that even
        though it may be legal for a bear hunt in a certain area, if bears are so accustomed to
        human presence then they should be off limits. What I saw was a discrace to all hunters,
        of which I am one . Your response? John Watson 8201 Spruce Street Anchorage, AK 99507
