              Hi I'm Cierra Kraemer and I am attending service high School for an Alaska Studies class.
              We are doing a project on the polar bears and the endangered species act. Me and my class
              partner were wondering if you could possibly come in and give your thoughts and oppinions
              on the issue. we know that you are very busy and whenever you could get back to us that
              would be great. Thank you for your time.
