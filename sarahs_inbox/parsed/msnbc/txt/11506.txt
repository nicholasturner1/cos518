            Governor,

            Tom, Pat, and I have just landed in Seattle enroute from DC to AK. We are concerned that
            a response message be consistent with other discussions . And, while we know that we are
            always willing to talk with the companies, CP is saying we will not talk, meaning we won't
            "negotiate".  Furthermore CP is trying to confuse the public, and we don't want to
            exascerbate any confusion.  Our preference is to think about how best to respond and get
            something out Monday.  However, if you feel something must go out immediately, then we
            propose we talk sometime later this afternoon after we land and put it together at that
            time.

            Thanks, Marty
