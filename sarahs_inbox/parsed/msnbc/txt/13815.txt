            MESSAGE:

            Please pass BILL: SB 256, the Sitka auditorium needs to get finished. My daughter is
            flying from Washington State for camp in June. I lived in Sitka from 1986 - 1995, and
            believe that finishing the new auditorium will provide an excellent stage for performing
            for the yearly fine arts camp and the Sitka School District.



             Please consider in passing the bill.



            Thank You!
