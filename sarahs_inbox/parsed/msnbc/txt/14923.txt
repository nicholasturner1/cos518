          Gov. Palin:



          I am a Wisonsin resident that saw the AP article about your new baby with down syndrome.
          My wife and I have a 2yr old girl (Sydney) with down syndrome. It is a challenge but no
          regrets.  We learn daily from her and she teaches us to slow down and enjoy the moments.
          The hard part is dealing with the gov't and not letting her fall through the cracks. Down
          Syndrome support groups help. My family wishes you best of luck and congrats.



           Sincerely,



          Eli C. Drake



          P.S.    My cousin , Ed Sasser , is Compact Director for your state.




                                                                1
