                 Subject: Password expiration warning
                 The password for SOA userlD 'govsp' expires Thursday May 8th , 2:34 PM.
                 In most state agencies, this is not the userlD and password used to logon to individual computers. The
                 password can be changed using the SOA Password Change page or Outlook Web Access.
                 Your new password must be at least eight characters long and include at least three of these four types of
                 characters:

                       · upper case alphabet
                       · lower case alphabet
                       · numbers
                       · punctuation or symbols

                 Prior passwords may not be re-used.

                Important Notel - Web browsers, email clients, handheld email devices and other applications can store
                and continue to use an old password after it has been changed, possibly triggering lockout. Such
                applications should be closed while (or immediately after) changing a password. These stored passwords
                may need to be updated or deleted.

                Please contact your local or departmental support technicians with any questions or requests for
                assistance related to changing passwords.
