            I followed up with Privile today. She's interested and willing to serve wherever we need her . I think she would
            be great on LBC-and she would be the only woman and the chair . She would also be someone we could rely
            on.

            Do you have any good women in mind from Fairbanks /Interior that would be good for LBC? It would be great to
            have two women on there out of the five total members . I'll cc gov so she knows what I'm thinking too . It may be
            that we go with Privilege or a guy named Privileged o if he pans out.

            Thanks Kris!

           good. lets replace hargraves NOW then.

           ask Privile about the fairbanks seat, ask Privileged or if interested in lbc (b/c Royalties bd isn't open)... if
           not her, then another good one from Valley to take Hargraves seat... asap.

             Darroll Hargraves will resign from the Local Boundary Commission . This will be another key person we
             can plug in . We still are actively searching for someone to fill the Fairbankstinterior seat.

             Boundary commission makeup shifts
             Staff Report
             Published May 9, 2007
             The faces are changing at the state's Local Boundary Commission.
             Chairman Darroll Hargraves announced last week that he will step down from the commission
             this summer. The news follows the April resignation of Tony Nakazawa, who until last month
             represented the state's Fourth Judicial District - which includes Fairbanks - for four years on
             the commission.
             The Local Boundary Commission considers proposals to create, or alter the boundaries of,
             municipal governments.
             Hargraves, a Wasilla resident, is leaving in order to "seek new business opportunities and
             political options that may be available to me in coming months."
             Nakazawa left the commission April 30. A former director of the University of Alaska
             Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service, he is in the process of moving to southcentral Alaska

             Nakazawa said the commission and its staff have a difficult job. "We're fortunate to have those
             people, the ones that have served before and the ones that will come in the future."
