            Pls add to yesterdays schedule met with Ben Stein in LA re: ASMI seafood marketing (in
            morning before that LA tv show appearance).

            I don't know if you received my email on that yesterday.



            Also, I'm doing stop-bys with those mayors that I now see on my schedule tomorrow instead
            of having mtgs with them before press availability. No time to get everything caught up on
            before talking to the press if I'm obligated to meet with more of these communities in
            last-minute meetings. COS and others will have to start taking more of those mtgs, esp
            ones that bump up against opportunities to speak to Alaskans via press conferences.



            There's a lot going on in legislature that I'll be asked about tomorrow, and trying to
            follow it all without regular updates from staff is tough- sometimes the media I find
            available on-line doesn't cover it all. I'll have to catch up myself tomorrow morning.
