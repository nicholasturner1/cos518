          Beth is drafting the speech .  She did receive some information from Seamount and pulled
          some background information from the IOGCC website .  We spent some time Saturday going
          over the message and specific items to include in the speech .  I will check in today to
          see how far along she is now .  Our goal was to get you a draft early and we should be on
          track.



          Mike
