            I'm in a meeting at the Calrson. I'll try again to call him. It's infuriating that he
            can't just tell assistants what the issue is instead of only insisting on reaching me
            directly. I'll try again...

            Governor - I don't know if you have had an opportunity to speak with Mayor Begich yet. He
            called the ANC office at 11: 00 a.m . to state that he needed to talk with you regarding
            KABATA - apparently things are happening on the local level, and he would like to discuss
            it before a news story breaks.



            Contact:                Mayor Begich
