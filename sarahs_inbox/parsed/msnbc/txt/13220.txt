             Governor Palin Supports Corrections Commissioner




            April 22 , 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today expressed her full support
            for Department of Corrections Commissioner Joe Schmidt.



            "Commissioner Schmidt has my full support as he and his team continue to bring remarkable
            reforms to the Department of Corrections ," Governor Palin said .   " Joe has emphasized
            recruitment, hiring 34 new officers in FY 2007 and authorizing an additional 43 officers
            for FY 2008 .   Joe's strength is his respect for the hard work and talent of his
            department ' s employees . He understands the role the department plays in protecting the
            public while providing offenders with the opportunity to successfully return to society.
             Joe has my unconditional support."



            The Alaska Correctional Officers Association voted today in favor of a "no confidence"
            measure.
