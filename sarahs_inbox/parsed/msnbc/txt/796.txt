Hi Todd,



If you need tickets to Juneau you can just let me know or call Fred directly (321-1611). The purpose,
I assume, would be to meet for planning the Foundation fundraiser.



Do you already have an appication for HoopTime? I can print one out and leave it on my desk-if that
helps.



Thanks,

Erika

 May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to address it
