             How about the phone line that rings upstairs at the house. I don't know the number, but
             this ensures a good phone connection.

             Governor - the Iditarod is inquiring on whether you can congratulate the winner again
            this year . The unfortunate aspect is the time. They're now estimating that the race will
            finish between midnight - 2 a.m. tomorrow (Tues night/Weds morning ).   They would call
            you at whatever number we provide . Looks possible to be Mackey again.

             Kris:




             At this point , I am estimating a finishing time of midnight - 2 a.m. tomorrow ( Tuesday
            night - Wednesday morning ).  As you know , the live television finish script ( broadcast.
            live on Channel 2 and streamed worldwide on iditarod . com) includes the Governor
            congratulating the race winner.




             This will take place 33 minutes from the time that the winner crosses the finish line.
            Assuming that the Governor wishes to participate ( we hope so , even at the odd hour!) we
            will need a phone number that we can call.


                                                                 2
