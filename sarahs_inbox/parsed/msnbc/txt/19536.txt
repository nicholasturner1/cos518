               Subject: Port Authority Has No Involvement with BBlll Ad
               July 16, 2008

               To:

               Governor Sarah Paln
               Members of the Alaska State Legislature
               Commissioner Tom Irwin
               Commissioner Pat Galvin
               Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford

               As a result of misinformation that is circulating about the Alaska Gasline Port Authority's
               (AGPA) involvement with the recent Backbone III (BBIII) ad , I felt it imperative to set the
               record straight. Please be assured that AGPA has not been a BBIII participant and was
               not involved in the formation, approval or financial sponsorship of the ad. AGPA was
               initially listed in the left-hand column of the ad. However, AGPA Chairman Bert Cottle
               immediately requested that AGPA's name be removed and you will note that AGPA is
               not listed in the latest version of the ad. Not one dime of AGPA funding has been used
               for the BBIII ad.

               The only ads AGPA has been responsible for are the recent ads regarding its partnering
               with Mitsubishi Corporation and Sempra LNG. The purpose of these ads is to
               announce and celebrate these significant developments which have been in the making

               for a long , long time. AGPA has never stopped laboring to assemble all of the parts and
               pieces of the LNG project. With diligence , professionalism and nose-to-the-grindstone , we will
               continue in that vein.

                I encourage each of you to contact me personally by email or phone (278-7000 office or 223-
                8530 cell) if you have any questions or concerns regarding this or any other AGPA related
                matter.

                Regards,

                Bill Walker
