              Governor and Todd:

              The Juneau Data Center is initiating a major power upgrade project on Sunday, June 1St, 2008. All of your
              accounts will be moved to the Anchorage server this Sunday, May 25, 2008 at 10:00 p.m. This conversion will
              take approx. 2 hours. This is a safety precaution.

              Your accounts then will be moved back to the Juneau Server on Saturday, June 7, 2008 at 10:00 p.m. This
              conversion will take approx. 2 hours.

              Thanks, Janice
