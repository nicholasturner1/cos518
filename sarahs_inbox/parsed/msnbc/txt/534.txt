  Hi Kari - I'm hoping you can forward this email to Todd Palin. My CEO Steve Haagenson talked with
  Todd at the Governor's picnic and Steve wants to make sure Todd knows he' s welcome to drop in and
  see our new power plant if he's in Fairbanks next week . I've attached the invitation which also has
  directions to the event in North Pole . Thanks for the help. Corinne
