                Governor -

                Mike forwarded me the meeting request from Talis and I have this set up for Monday, 04.07.08 at 9:30 a.m. on
                your schedule.

                The AK Women in Documentary folks (2) are still planning to arrive in Juneau on Tuesday, 04.08.08 and
                Wednesday, 04.09.08 for an interview, shadowing at the office, and shadowing with the family. I realize that this
                will be a hectic week as it's the last week of session and hopefully they will understand if they have to just be on
                call some of the time.

                Thanks, Janice
