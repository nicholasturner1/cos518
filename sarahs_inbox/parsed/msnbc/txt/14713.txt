             Subject: Airline Negotiations




             Mike:



             DOT has been trying to negotiate an agreement with the airlines regarding use of the
             Anchorage and Fairbanks airports. In the last month, both sides, the State and now the
             airlines have made some concessions and come closer to reaching an agreement. The current
             main outstanding issue relates to agreeing on the amount of the capital improvement
             project plan for Anchorage airport that the airlines will have to fund.



            The laws and rules the airport operates under give the State leverage over the airlines.
            At any point in the negotiations, the State can choose to stop negotiating and send out a
            proposed agreement to all the airlines. Whichever airlines choose to accept it become
            "signatory" airlines and pay lesser fees and costs than airlines that choose not to sign.



            DOT has a letter in draft form that it wants to send offering to meet with the airlines on
            May 13 and May 14 to try and reach a final agreement.
