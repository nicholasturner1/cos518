           Ms. Palin, I know you don't have time to read emails that are beyond what's necessary to
           govern the state, but I wanted to express how refreshing it is to have a leader that
           hasn't forgotten that she is a representative of the people who elected her. Thank you
           for your care and respect of those you serve a

                Hello Governor,

               I have not met Ms. Kozioff, but she is in error about our request and our budget . We gained this year (FY09) like
               no other time . 40 additional Correctional Officers and programs . I'm heading to Juneau this afternoon and I'll get
               with Randy and talk this over. Heck, I'd meet with her. I've done that before and it worked out well . A cup of coffee
               is cheap. they started running an ad this morning about a magician and my removal of the word "Emergency"
               from our count sheets. Geez.

               Thank you so much for your support, and Todd' s calls have been a God send also.

                Joe

               Hope all is well Joe- you're doing a great job and I don't want you or your family feeling any stress through this bit of a trial.

               I tried responding to this constituent, Ms. Kozioff, and she's obviously not in a mood to hear from me or Randy ... do you
               know her or anything abouiut her - why she may be so angry? Don't spend time looking into it, just wondered if you knew
               her.

               Governor:

               Ms. Kozioff sounds pretty emotional. I will have operating budget numbers on several increments we supported for DPS and
               DOC from Mary Sutton at OMB tomorrow and would like to send that information to Ms . Kozioff. She is certainly entitled
               to her opinion, but she should be forming that opinion on the true facts about the budget.

               I will also work on a response about the situation with Commissioner Schmidt . I believe that for at least the last month Joe
               has had a standing offer to sit down with the union and work together to resolve the issues . I think the union refused to meet
               with Joe and resolve any issues because that would not have fit well with the way they were portraying Joe to members or
               helped steer their no-confidence vote the way they wanted . These guys were trying to bully Joe and us. I will add a few
               sentences that the Commissioner continues to wait for the union to come to the table and get to work on the issues.

               Several individuals like former DOC Commissioner Margaret Pugh who know how this union operates and who know him
               have written in support. We received another e-mail of support yesterday from a former Director of Institutions who worked
               with Joe and retired from DOC in 1998.

               Governor,

                I will respond to this and then I won't be writing again.

               My email to you was entitled CORRECTIONS and had to do with your unconditional support of your friend , Joe Schmidt.
               Your response addresses the DPA budget.

                I won't respond as to the DPS budget numbers or Corrections for that matter . My email was clearly ALL about your
               response and how bad it looks. You know that . Your response, or lack thereof, only showed me that what everyone is now
               talking about is exactly true . You don't care what the residents of this State think. You don't care what the employees of the
               State think or feel. Its all about you and your friends . I am so disappointed.

               Thanks for the "congrats "! Trig is amazing.

                Re: the budget, not sure where you got the information or numbers you mention in your email , but we invite you to look at
               the actual DPS budget and the growth you 'll see there. For further clarification on the numbers you seem to be referring to,
               feel free to contact my special assistant on DPS budget , Mr. Randy Ruaro (he's cc'd in this email).

                Thank you for contacting me, have a good weekend.

               Governor Palin,

               I have long supported you and have absolutely been in love with how you
               conduct yourself and conduct business for our State . I have been behind
               your husband in his desire to go back to the Slope , stating it's no
               one's business but yours and his. I have applauded you, flying out to
               be at your son's graduation (my son serves in the U. S. Navy). I have
               laughed and cried, and more recently read and viewed the pictures of
               your newborn son, adoring how precious he is and knowing he's being bom
               into a loving and strong family.

              Having said all of that , Governor, this time you have missed the mark by
              a mile with your "unconditional support" of Joe Schmidt. All the good
              things you've done-have been undone in one fell swoop in my eyes.
              Everyone knows you went to high school together - so what are you
              saying? That all of these people are liars and have some ax to grind?
              I do not have family members who work in corrections - this is just
              plain old common sense . You seriously need to rethink your stance on
              this issue. Corrections is in a world of hurt. This man not only
              didn't ask for more money for corrections (that's fine), but he GAVE
              some BACK? And now you don't believe the people who have given him a no
              confidence vote? Come on!

              I didn't even write to you when you cut the DPS budget by 1.2 million
              dollars, and I DO have a family member who serves this State as a State
              Trooper. That was bad enough...but this....this is just wrong and
              believe me, you need to seriously think about rectifying this situation,
              despite the fact that this jerk is your long time friend. Do the right
              thing. Practice what you preach, Governor.
