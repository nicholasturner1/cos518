          Hello Governor,



          I talked with APRN on Friday as they asked about the trial and how it

          affects our planning. I told Ellen that it doesn't. We are not talking

          to any lobbyist about our planning. Our plan is about foresight and

          ensuring our needs are met in five and ten years. She asked if our

          plan would bring our prisoners home from Az. and I told her that it

          did.



          Thank you for the e mail, and I'll call over next week and see if you

          have a few minutes. Of course, I'm rattling around the valley so any

          time you'd like to talk... I'm game.




          Joe
