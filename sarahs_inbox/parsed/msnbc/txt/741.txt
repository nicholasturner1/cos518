Subject: Alaska Young Fishermen's Summit - Opening Reception




Todd - The Governor received an invite from the Alaska Young Fishermen's Summit - Opening
Reception for Monday, December 10, 2007 @ 7:00 p.m. @ the ANC Hilton Hotel. They would like
the Governor to address the group that evening. They would also like to host Cora Crome.



This second event will bring together young fishermen from around the state to network and learn
how to be successful in Alaska's fishing industry. The groups will sponsor approximately 75 young
fishermen to attend.



The Governor has asked that if you're available that you and Cora attend on her behalf. Frank has
spoken to the Governor on this event also. It is Eric Olsen's Event and there will be lots of fishermen
present.




                                                       1                              ROSTON 01174
