          Subject: Deal with IBU



          We reached a deal with IBU. Unlikely as it sounds. We compared what it would have cost
          us. with a.3,3,3 over the last two years and offered:



           $2137 signing bonus for each employee for the first year (0% in lieu of $2137 cash)

           followed by 5% effective July 1, 2009

           followed by 4% effective July 1, 2010.



           We considered with this union the savings of them NOT having a contract for going on two
          years and our conversations with Washington state which ended up going to arbitration with
          its maritime unions, where they were treated pretty well.



           The amount of money involved was minor to get to this agreement, considering our options.

           More specifics later.

          As external communications, Rosanne, who was the overseer of this project - and all the
          work that went into producing and support - author this. I would hope that Bonnie would
          also thank the administration and First Gentleman for their efforts here. Kate worked
          directly with her.

          (I'm looking for someone to correct the letter writer's goofy comments, but don't want the
          letter to ADN in response to come from me. Also, Frank - do you have Bonnie Faulk's phone
          #, she's pageant director)

          Dear Editor:

          To address Judi Spry's Anchorage Daily News letter-to-the-editor on July 26 asking where
          the Governor was during this year's Miss Alaska Pageant:



          First, when I asked Gov. Palin if she was ever Miss Alaska (as Ms. Spry stated), our
          Governor replied, "Nope, a mere "Miss Congeniality", one of the runner-up sashes, and
          much-needed college scholarships were my wins as a participant in that scholarship progam,
          about 100 years ago it seems now".

            The letter suggested the Governor didn't take time to attend the four-hour pageant due
          to a lack of support. Although constantly apologizing for not being able to accept all
          invitations, in this situation it was especially important for Alaska to have Governor
          Palin keep her committment to travel to Fairbanks that evening between the weekend's
          statewide Governor's Annual Community Picnics and meet with seven US Congressmen who were
          touring ANWR.

             Due to time constraints, to support pageant participants Gov. Palin did take time to
          record a video which was shown during the pageant. Arid significantly, First Gentleman Todd
          Palin spend two days judging the event. Todd left commercial fishing early this season to
          keep his committment judge, and those who know the fishing industry (and those who know
          Todd!) can appreciate the sacrifice that was on the part of Todd Palin to support the
          pageant, on behalf of the Governor and First Family.

           Governor,



          On monday afternoon, the senate energy committee is going to hear from governors Hickel
          and Knowles at 2:00. We are familiar with their respective messages : vote no on AGIA
          (albeit for different reasons).

          tomorrow.
