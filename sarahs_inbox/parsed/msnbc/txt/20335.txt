          MESSAGE:

          Sarah,



          I remember a time WAY BACK WHEN when I took you under my wing at KTUU-TV2 in Anchorage,
          AK.



          I had NEVER connected Sarah Heath with Sarah Palin UNTIL our good friend (and my fellow
          sports reporter) Steve Turcotte connected the dots for me during his recent trip to
          Juneau!



         My heartfelt congratulations to you for all you've accomplished in your incredible life in
         Alaska.




          I would welcome the opportunity to see you again some day and --at the very least-- to
          talk with you on the phone soon.



          I trust you will do all that' s possible to make that happen!!!



         I'm in San Diego where I've spent most of the last two years nursing my aging parents
         through the last years of their lives and safely delivering them back to their Lord and
         creator.



         My blessings and my best to you, young lady!



         Sincerely,
                                                             1
