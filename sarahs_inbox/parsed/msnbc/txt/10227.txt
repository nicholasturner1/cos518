             Governor, All,

             I want to let you know that I just spoke with Speaker Harris to ensure he could say he'd
             been in touch with the Administration prior to tomorrows AGIA application deadline, and to
             ensure he was aware of what would and would not occur tomorrow. He was very appreciative
             and advised he was committed to working with us as we progress through the AGIA process.

             Marty
