                  I can get these done...! know it!

                  Two good labor guys I got from Kris: Privileged or Personal Mate

                  They could fill two of the seats on Workers Comp or Labor Relations . I do think there are a couple of good people
                  that could be re-appointed . Coupled with a few changes (the aforementioned or others ) I think it shows the public
                  we're not sticking with the status quo and are ready and willing to make the needed changes . By tomorrow Labor
                  will be covered with great people.

                  By 4:30 tomorrow we'll be ready to send everything but Mental Health Trust.. . and Fish and Game if we aren't
                  finished with the conclusions there.

                  Gov, sorry this is taking up so much of your much needed time! I know you need to focus on the gasline, budget,
                  and my three favorite Palin girls.
