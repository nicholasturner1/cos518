            Great idea on speaking directly w reporters- we'll see what lawmakers say in their loam
            press availability- they're supposed to "clarify and correct" their press releases' bogus
            claims from last night, according to Mike. Hopefully Mike and Karen will be very adament
            about correcting their misstatements today, via direct communications with reporters (and
            I'll be there), esp in reaction to what Senators are supposed to say by way of corrections
            this morning.

            We can speak with them as they attend some of our open mtgs with lawmakers throughout the
            day in the conf room perhaps?

            What's Bill going to do next??

            Governor-



            We addressed most of these issues in the release that went out on

            Friday.     Rather than another release, a more proactive way may be to

            talk directly with reporters. Several are planning to attend the

            meetings with lawmakers today and tomorrow. Thoughts? Btw - I am

            hearing this is the last session for Bill McAllister.

            Slices $208 Million from Governor Palin' s Increases




             (JUNEAU) - Today the Alaska Senate passed the state ' s FY 09 operating

            budget , House Bill 310, after a thorough and complete review of all the

            spending increases proposed by the Palin administration.




            "The Senate Finance Committee has always believed that living within our

            means starts with slowing down the growth of the state operating

            budget," said Senate Finance Co - Chair Lyman Hoffman , D-Bethel. "We

            started with Governor Palin' s version that was 17 percent larger than

            last year. After weeks of analyzing that budget we were able to trim

            that increase by nearly five percent."




            "This is a sound budget that meets the people ' s needs ," said Senate

            President Lyda Green , R-Wasilla .   " However ,   I am still concerned about

            the total dollar amount . We were able to make reductions to the

            Governor ' s budget , but more will need to be made next year so that we

            can save as much of the surplus as possible."




            The Senate started its review by applying the following three principals

            to the FY 09 spending plan:




                                                                4

            *      No new state positions unless absolutely necessary

            *      Refrain from backfilling the loss of federal funds with state

            general funds

            *      Curb expansion of existing programs without sound justification




            By applying these principals the Senate crafted a spending plan that

            curbs the growth of state government by $208 million and saves as much

            of the budget surplus as possible and:




            *      Reduces Governor Palin ' s proposed operating budget increase from

            17 percent to 11 . 5 percent

            *      Slashes the number of new state government positions in the

            Palin administration ' s proposed budget by half from 305 to 157

            *      Turned away the expansion of state programs proposed by the

            Palin administration for a savings of $40 million




            The FY 09 operating budget uses $ 4.2 billion in general fund revenue.

            The operating budget now goes back to the House for concurrence. If the

            House declines to concur with the Senate ' s changes a joint conference

            committee will be appointed to come up with compromise legislation.




            For more information ,    contact Senator Hoffman at    ( 907) 465-4453.
