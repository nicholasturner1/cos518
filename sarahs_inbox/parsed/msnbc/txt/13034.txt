           Subject :                Ask Harris

           Importance:              High


           While you're down there... Ask him WHY he doesn't want to just sit down and talk about
           overall spending and what projects are appropriate? We're offering, why's he refusing?
           Also, I'm going email Meyer unless someone can ask him why he'd say such a thing to
           McAllister re: a "cat fight" the other day.



           Pls ask Harris WHY tho', before I talk to reporters today.
