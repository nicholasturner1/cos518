              Dear Mayor Begich - The Governor has directed the Office of Management & Budget (OMB) to
              conduct a comprehensive review of the operating and capital budgets. OMB staff have contacted each
              legislator and asked for a prioritized list of projects within each district. In addition, OMB staff is
              reviewing the back up for the projects and will follow up with legislators if there are questions. Our
              deadline to complete this review is noon Monday, May 12, 2008.

              The Governor, and my office, is receiving numerous requests for meetings with individuals and
              communities to discuss specific projects. Given the volume of projects, it simply is not possible to meet
              with every community or project sponsor. Would it be possible to arrange a meeting for you and your
              staff with two of the governor's special assistants, Ms. Anna Kim and Mr. Randy Ruaro? Ms. Kim and
              Mr. Ruaro will be in Anchorage May 5 - 7 and would be happy to meet with you. I will ask that they
              contact your office on Monday to find a time that works with your schedule.

              Thank you for your assistance. Karen
