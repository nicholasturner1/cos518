           MESSAGE:

           Could you tell me if the Governor has signed the Energy Relief Bill yet?




           I am a Senior Citizen and just want to make sure that we are going to get that relief. It
           is a very hard struggle at this period in our life. With this relief it will help
           tremendously.



           I must have enough #1 oil to last the winter which this Energy Relief bill will do.




           Thank you,




                                                                                                              PRA_GSP01_0022992
