        Subject:                  Constituent work


        May I get lists of people whom we are sending 'congrats/thank you,etc' notes... I've had
        so many questions from constituents re: why I didn't acknowledge someone or some event...
        Or being asked if I ever received a request - and why perhaps I didn't thank someone ...
        Especially here in anch this weekend , running into so many people, quite a few additional
        comments have come my way in this regard . Don't know how previous govs did it, and as
        mayor I pretty much did it personally - which I could continue if I know we're not
        duplicating or missing anything.



        We've been seeking a better system w/this - I think the solution is to just send me lists
        of correspondence so i'll know what I'm missing and I can start filling in more gaps.
        Thank you!
