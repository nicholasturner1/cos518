              Thanks so much Kate! What a great day!
              Your Hillsdale comments are super... I'm tweaking just a bit at the beginning and will get you a
              copy.
              Thank you!

              Governor,
              CONGRATULATIONS! What a great day for Alaska and Alaskans . All your Anchorage staff are so proud
              to be just that - your Anchorage staffO

             I did want to let you know that I was contacted this afternoon by Tim Caspar with Hillsdale College,
             requesting a copy of your remarks when all is said and done , because it's very likely they'll want to use
             this speech as a column in Imprimis. How cool is that? Anyway , I've changed the speech to reflect
             today's results , and I've asked Janice to print it off and make sure it gets to you. I look forward to seeing
             you next week, and perhaps you can verify for me how close you kept to the speech , so I can know how
             to alter it further before submitting it to Hillsdale.

             Thanks so much, Governor, and I hope you are able to truly savor this day.
