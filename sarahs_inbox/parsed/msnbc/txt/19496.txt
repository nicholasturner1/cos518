             We have looked through ANWR letters but do not recall a specific one of invite. This may have been a
             verbal invite. Janice

             Frank and I are trying to recall if our letter of invite went out to him, or who specifically in all
             these months of me inviting critics to visit it. Maybe Janice knows.

             He's not at this conference and he's already been there (is my understanding... don't quote me on
             that I'll have Joe or Tom or someone confirm), but yes we've sent out the word that we want him,
             obama, everyone else to get up here and see the swath of land for themselves. I've spoken w him
             about ANWR but don't remember if in that conversation 5 months ago I repeated our open
             invitation for him and other elected officials to come up. Maybe I should put the invite in written
             form too?
