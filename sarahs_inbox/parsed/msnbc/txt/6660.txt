         Subject:                  Employee Recognition Awards


         I understand that there is perhaps a bit of confusion regarding the employee

         awards.     To be clear and so that everyone is on the same page - the request

         was to have the Governor in Anchorage "for just an hour" the week of May let

         or May 7th. Since there are no plans to have the Governor in Anchorage, I

         made the determination that since those dates are critical to our AGIA

         efforts and ensuring the Governor's availability to legislators, etc., it

         would be difficult to arrange for a trip to Anchorage for an awards

         ceremony.



         I was told perhaps it could move to the week of the 14th, but that is the

         final week of session and will be equally as challenging since the Governor

         is expected to remain in Juneau during that crucial week. At that point, I

        was told that if the Governor couldn't be in Anchorage, perhaps the ceremony

        could happen in Juneau and the Governor could honor the 15 from Juneau (of

        the roughly 100 recipients).           My understanding is that I am still waiting to

        hear if that is truly an option.



        Thanks,

        Meg
