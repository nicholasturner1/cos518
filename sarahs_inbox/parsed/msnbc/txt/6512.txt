           Nope - so I responded with the assumption that the majority said Anchorage . Kyle will now
           be confused and convinced I dont know if we ' re coming or going on this issue.

          I cant read the results here, so unless u can open it and send summary to me asap I'll
          just tell Kyle that the results dont surprise me (assuming it says Anchorage ) and thats
          where it should be then.
