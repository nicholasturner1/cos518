             Thank you for the invitation to be here today, Karl. I
             appreciate it. And I appreciate your message.


            There is no doubt that this project will benefit Alaskans.
             I am excited to see an investment of this magnitude - a
             $17 million investment - that will help not only the adults
             in this community, but our children.


            But I also appreciate the fact that you are withdrawing
            your $1. 5 million request in the state 's capital budget.
            While you are providing a valuable asset to the state, any
            time that people can reach into the private sector to raise
            funds - I applaud it.


            Thank you for your consideration on behalf of all
