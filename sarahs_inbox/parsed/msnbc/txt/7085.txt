          Subject:                  Painted bears


          Denby: any input you can give me on the painted bears idea that I read about (and recvd
          emails on) yest in ADN's top story?



          Not sure about that one - at least the way it came across in the press . Others are saying
          painting some but not others leave the impression some bears are harmless - I had to
          respond that I did not know about this until I read the article.



          Pis fill me in. Thank you
