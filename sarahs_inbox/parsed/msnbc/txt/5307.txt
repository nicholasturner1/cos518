                   Will there be time for all of you to sit down and discuss fish policy? We have numerous
                   requests like this one and we need to start working through them.

                   Please tell me what's possible and if the request below is as well.

                   Thanks,
                   Meg

                   Hello Meghan,

                   I spoke with Sharon on the phone on Friday and she suggested I e-mail you this request to interview Gov.
                   Palin by telephone sometime in the next two weeks.

                  As you know, IntraFish is the leading source of information for the world 's seafood industry and there is a
                  lot of interest and curiosity from people in our community about what the governor 's vision is for the
                  Alaska seafood sector, what goals she has for the industry and how she plans to make her vision a
                  reality. As we did with Gov. Murkowski (his interview appeared in our February 2005 issue ), we propose a
                  straight question -and-answer format where the governor 's responses are recorded and transcribed
                  verbatim , with some minimal editing possible to fit the story into whatever it's assigned space will be in the
                  April issue . We have an Alaska Focus section running in the paper that month , and her comments would
                  be the centerpiece of the section.

                   While I won 't provide a list of questions beforehand , I will be happy to provide a guideline of sorts so she
                   could be prepared to speak on the particular topics I would like to address . The interview should last
                   about 20 minutes to a half hour . I would need to have it completed before the end of business on Friday,
                   March 9, as I am off to Boston then for the big seafood show , and will have to prepare the paper for
                   production upon my return.

                  We also would request some photos of the governor , especially any that show her at her family 's salmon
                  farm, or in some seafood -related capacity if possible.

                  I am in the office each day from 5 : 30 a.m. to 2 p. m., so feel free to call or e-mail with any questions. I
                  would like to finalize an interview time by the end of this week and conduct the interview next week, the
                  earlier in the week the better.

                  Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you on this.
