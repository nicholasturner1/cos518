                Governor Palin,

                I wanted to let you know that Mike Kolivosky passed away yesterday . You may know him from the Valley . If not,
                he was appointed under Gov Sheffield to a position in Public Safety. His wife is Melinda who works for Bill Tull
                and organizes the Palmer Pride parade every year (she's one of the MCs ). I've sent notification to the constituent
                relations office.

                Thanks,

                Ivy Frye
