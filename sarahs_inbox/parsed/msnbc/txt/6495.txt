           Subject: RE: apology

           Hi Ivy: I'm back in the office. I've looked over the new roster and have a couple of updates on
           Council members. Should I just fax the corrections to you on your original form or send you our
           list?

          Also, if you have Gail Niebrugge or Aryne Randall's email and phone, could you send that along.
           I'd like to contact them today and welcome them to the Council.

           Regarding the Vice Chair - I would like to recommend, and I know that Ben Brown would concur,
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


          Thanks for all your help. Best, Charlotte
