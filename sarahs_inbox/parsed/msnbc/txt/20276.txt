             Per Mike's request, I've drafted the = correspondence below from Governor Palin to President
             Bush expressing her = support for the request made by ten Senators that the President authorize =
             seismic work in the coastal plain of ANWR.



             The Honorable George W. Bush
             The White House
             Washington, DC 20500

             Dear Mr. President:

            As Governor of Alaska, I'm writing to express = my strong support for the request made on
            August 1, 2008 by ten US = Senators that you issue an Executive Order authorizing seismic
            work by the = US Geological Survey on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife =
            Refuge (ANWR).

            I know that you are very familiar with the = reasons for Congressional action to permit
            environmentally responsible oil = and gas development in a small portion of the coastal plain.
            So, I = won't reiterate these arguments here, except to express my appreciation = for your
            previous support.

            There has been no seismic activity in ANWR = since 1983. During this time, seismic technology
            has evolved = considerably, and so-called (3-D) seismic can tell us much more about the = sub-
            surface geology of the coastal plain than techniques available in the = early 1980's. Moreover,
            current technology is non-invasive; there would virtually be no surface or sub-surface impact.


            As you know, Section 1003 of the Alaska = National Interest Lands Conservation Act requires

             Congressional authorizati= on for exploratory drilling and development within the coastal plain. =

             development in ANWR, everyone would benefit from = additional information concerning the most
             promising unexplored petroleum = province in North America.

             In my opinion, the energy situation affecting = this country verges on a national emergency. The
             development of our = oil and gas resources is not a solution by itself, but it should be part = of any

             Increasingly, Americans are recognizing = the importance of domestic oil and gas development in

             people about whether to authorize full scale development and production in = approximately 2,000 acres
             of the coastal plain..

             For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully = request that you use your authority as President to improve
