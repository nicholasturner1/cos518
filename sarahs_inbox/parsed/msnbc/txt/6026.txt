          Dear Governor Palin,



          Thank you for your recent telephone call. The Alaska Gas Project is very important to
         BP, as is our entire Alaska business, and for that reason I have assigned executive
         accountability for the project to Andy Inglis who succeeded me as CEO of Exploration and
         Production for BP.  Andy is very familiar with Alaska, having worked and lived their in
         the past.  Andy looks forward to meeting with you in Alaska when a convenient time can be
         arranged.  I have also requested that Doug Suttles, President BP Exploration Alaska and
         our senior representative in Alaska, meet with you in the near future to ensure that you
         have appropriate access to BP to discuss Alaska Gas and any other matters relating to our
         business in Alaska.



          Thank you again for your call.



          Yours Sincerely
                                                                  1
