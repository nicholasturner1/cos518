             Subject:       ANCHORAGE ASSEMBLY PRESS RELEASE
             Importance: High
            I LEFT A MESSAGE ON BEGICH'S CELL PHONE - HIS PRESS PERSON IS OUT OF TOWN AND
            I'M TRYING TO AVOID A CONVERSATION WITH RAMSEUR, BUT WILL TURN TO HIM IN A
            FEW MINUTES, IF THE MAYOR STILL HASN'T RECEIVED MY MESSAGE. THE QUOTE FROM
            THE MAYOR IS WHAT I'M PROPOSING - AND BASED ON WHAT HE SAID TO ME YESTERDAY
            IN A CONVERSATION.

            WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE REST?
