             Subject:                 Native seal/preamble


             Rhonda- Talis and I heard Vic Fischer and Byron Mallott speak at Tom Stewart's memorial
             service yesterday. We both caught something significant that was addressed, and Tom
             Stewart may have wanted accomplished (we sure want it accomplished): there's no mention of
             Alaska's first people in our Constitution's preamble, nor is there Native symbolism shown
             on our State Seal.



             We'd like to do something about that, and since it's our 50th, this is a perfect time to
             add either the illustration or articulation of respect for Ak Natives.   Let's be thinking
             about what we can do there! And have a good Sunday- thanks for being part of Friday's
             press event.
