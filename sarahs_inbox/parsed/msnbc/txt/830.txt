Greetings:



Hope the first family is enjoying Juneau. In any case, here's something to give you a chuckle. A
duo called "Oil and Water" performed a song at the Anchorage Folk Festival this Saturday called
"Governor's a Babe."



Here's what the program said: OIL and WATER. Sarcastic Alaskan folk. The best diesel mechanic
on the slope and a boat builder from Prince of Wales come to Anchorage to sing and meet women at
the Contra . Mark Jaqua and Steve Petritus.



Enjoy....



P.S. I am forwarding this to Kris to give her a smile too.
