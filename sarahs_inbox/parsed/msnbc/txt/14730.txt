           Folks are digging into Steven's current trip to Belgium on state dime, and his trips to
           Puerto Rico, other Leg's travel... contrasting that with Harris/Green not reimbursing folks
           to travel to AGIA meetings.

           We're working on a story about the travel. I have David from APRN helping out. They have a
