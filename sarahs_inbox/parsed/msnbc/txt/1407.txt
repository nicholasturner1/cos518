The commissioner's office wasn't sure what time you would return from the tour, so I booked you on
the 10pm. flight; I can change that if you'd like. There are flights leaving Fairbanks at 3:00pm and
5:00pm. that you can stand by for if you get back in time.



Let me know if there's anything else that you need for this trip.



Thanks!

Erika
