            Governor Palin,

            Here are a few things I put together for Glenallen. What's key is there is one board member from Glenallen-
            something we are actively working to change. Also, Ken Johns has applied for PFD Corporation, incase that
            comes up. I left hard copies with Kari to provide you.

            I'm in Wasilla this weekend if you want me to meet you up there and give a B&C pitch in Glenallen.

            Thanks,

            Ivy Frye
