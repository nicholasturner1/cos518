             Boss,



              I'd like to include Randy Ruaro on judge interviews end of this month if that's ok.



              It'd be great to have an attorney with us asking the questions which he is.

             I think that would be great to include him. Randy is top notch and he would be a real
            asset to have involved in the interview process. Thanks for asking.

              Mike,




             Would it be possible to include Randy Ruraro on Judge Interviews towards the end of May?
            I do a lot of research on these building up to the actual calls but it would be great to
            have an attorney's sense in the actual interview.




             I haven't run it by the Gov nor have I asked Randy, but wanted to get your sense.   We
            don't have a date yet but Mike, the Gov and I typically do these by phone towards the end
            of the 45 day window (end of this month).




             Thanks.




                                                          2
