         Kris- please forward to Franci and our Ag Board our sincere appreciation for everything!
         It was an amazing month - the board members made tough, sound, smart decisions and Alaska
         is grateful for their tremendous efforts. Today's ADN editorial is a nice "kudos" to the
         board and new Ag leadership and should be encouragement as they seek answers to the
         ongoing challenges.  Thanks Kris!
