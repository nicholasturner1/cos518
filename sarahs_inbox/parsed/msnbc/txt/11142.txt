              Yeah- let's give her a "verbal invitation" to do so.

             Sheesh....



             Don't know what's stopping friendly senators from coming over tomorrow night.



             Just send Lyda a DVD and tell her to pop some popcorn and have SoS movie night.



             This is beyond silly and Lyda will come out the loser.

              I'm receiving a lot of emails on this dust up- saying it's the most petty (and cruel, be
              Lyda knows I made the committment to Track's graduation AFTER I got word that the 6pm
              speech would work for the legislature) thing they've seen in many years.



             It's like Lesil mumbling to me that the only way they can work with Lyda is to just keep
             remembering she's "Mean , Mean Lyda Green".



             Where are her peeps on this , though? Why do they let her get away with things like this-
             just to "one - up" someone , so unnecessarily?



             I hope the plan is to just address the House, we'll chat with the Senate next week then?

             For what it's worth - Bill McAllister said they would likely cover the speech (a portion
             if not all) live if it were at 6 p.m.
