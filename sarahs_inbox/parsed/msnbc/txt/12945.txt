          Tomorrow's fine. Let him know that mischaracterizations like that really erode the spirit
          of trust and communication that I had believed he was trying to manifest. He's done this
          to us how many times now?

          Meyer, Chenault and Harris are supposed to talk tomorrow about the supplemental and our
          proposal.  I was planning on checking in with them to get a read prior to Monday's floor
          session.  If tomorrow is OK, I will ask Meyer and let you know his response.

          Pls ask Kevin Meyer why he told McAllister that Lyda and I were in a cat fight before the
          reporter arrived with a camera the other day when we all met in my conference room. Then
          pls let me know what Kevin's answer was. I wonder why he would say that - it is not true.
          Wonder why these guys aren't trustworthy- when they tell reporters things like that?
