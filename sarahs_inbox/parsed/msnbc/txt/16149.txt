                Thank you all for helping make Wednesday's ceremonial HB166 PFD Check-Off bill
                signing a tremendous success . Whether you helped usher the concept through the
                multiyear legislative process, moved the bill across key desks to get it signed , rolled up
                your sleeves and got working on implementation , or came to show your support at the
                bill signing , we could never have had such a wonderful event without you. Thank you!
