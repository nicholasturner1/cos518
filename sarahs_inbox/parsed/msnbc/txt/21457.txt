               Pls let me know when the new policy on email searches is drafted. Hopefully we can take
               care of that this week ? I still haven ' t received answers from Mike on the emailed
               questions I asked him on Saturday re: the open-ended aspect of his request to you in the
               email search.



               Just want to make sure it's in writing asap that this isn't allowed.
