            No problem. We had it all set for Jerry and Janice even talked w/McHugh this morning to
            reconfirm that he would get her the proc. I'll have to follow-up. .

            Kris, thx for your help today. Sorry I had to call you spur of the moment. Email from
            Randy below. Governor, great improv. John Combs, benny cottle, diana straub all said it
            was a nice poem.

             No, Jerry didn't show up with the proclamation. I'm not sure what happened. I would have
            brought it myself had I known. The governor read a speech from a women's auxiliary group.
            She did great. I'll be looking for you in the newspaper.

             Ivy:



             Did Jerry ever show up with the proclamation? Everything here went well, I covered two
            events, including SE Veterans where there was about 200 to 300 people. (My son and I may
            even end up in a photo in the newsletter ) Anna is covering the event tonight with Mike
            Huckabee at the Andersons' house at Auke Lake.
