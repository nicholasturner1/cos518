               First, and most important, all board members serve at the pleasure of the
               governor. Mike Barnhill from Law confirmed this for me in March.

               Second, Don Giles' term expires 6/30/07. He was appointed by Murkowski
               5/13/2004.

               Duncan Fields and Kevin Adams also have terms expiring 6/30/07.

               The statute doesn't specify if the president/ceo of a seafood processor must
               sit on the board. I think Law would agree the statute is open for
               interpretation and you could choose anyone employed by the processor to
               represent the processor. I will make sure this is the case.

               It does specify that the processor must have an annual payroll in Alaska of
               $2.5 million or more. Large processors currently on ASMI:
               Trident
               Icicle
               Peter pan
               Ocean Beauty

               All Alaska processors with an annual payroll of 2.5 million or more:
               Trident
               UniSea
               Icicle
               Peter Pan
               Westward
               Ocean Beauty
               North Pacific
               Norquest

               Large processors on the board currently:
               Joe Bundrant, VP of Trident
               Darry Collier, President/CEO of Peter Pan Seafoods
               Mark Palmer, President/COO of Ocean Beauty
               Don Giles, President/CEO Icicle
