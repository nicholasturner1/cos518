Todd,



It is for the graduation ceremony for the first Entry Level Mine Labor training program that is being
held at UAS Tech Center in Juneau. This was a collaboration of DOL, UAA/MAPTS, UAS and
mining companies (Kensington, Greens Creek & Niblack). There are 16 people that will graduate
with several mining certificates from this 5 weeks of training.



I wasn't sure if you were aware that it was in Juneau. A speech isn't necessary; your attendance
and support would be great!




                                                     2                                ROSTON 01141

The Governor said that I should contact you to see if Mr.Todd Palin's schedule would allow him
attend the graduation of the Entry Level Mine Labor Training class next week. She said that he is
working on workforce development issues and if he is available she thought he would like to attend.




Thank you,




Mary
