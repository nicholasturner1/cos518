           MESSAGE:

           Since you are probably going to be in Fairbanks next Saturday for the finish of the Iron
           Dog,  What about stopping by KJNP Radio in North Pole at 8:00 am for the Coffee Cup
           program?  You were on it during your election campaign once.



           Also if you do stop by, I would like to have my daughters meet you after the program for a
           few minutes.



           I work at the station and could have them stop by after 9:00 if I knew beforehand.
