Todd are you overnighting in Fairbanks after our trip? If so you are welcome to stay with Darlene and
I we have two empty beds. I have a set of wheels if you have other plans as well. Click also after
talking with the gas consultant I don't think we will have time to do a comprehensive p- bay tour.
