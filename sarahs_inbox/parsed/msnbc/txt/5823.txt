            MESSAGE:
            Dear, Governor Palin
            I've live in Alaska for the past 37years and a veteran of the
            US Air Force. I'm African American and disillusioned by the fact
            that your administration did not appoint any African Americans
            in key positions such as commissioners , deputy commissioners or
            directors of departments. As a matter of fact the African American
            directors was let go just recently. I know that there are African
            Americans in this state that could sucessfully fill these positions. Madam
            Governor fix this problem soon
