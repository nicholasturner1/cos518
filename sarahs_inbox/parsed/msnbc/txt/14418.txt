            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            Congratulations to you and your husband on the birth of your fifth child, Trig.



            Your steadfast support for life and family sounds a clear bugle call to rally good people
            to resist the builders of a secular humanist society, the culture of death. Those seeking
            truth, however, will hear you and be glad.



            May God bless and keep you and your family,



            Kindest regards,



            Ed & Pauline Mullen
