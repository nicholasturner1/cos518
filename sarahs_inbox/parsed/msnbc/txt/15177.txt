           Looks like Bruce has some good strategy he's still trying to flesh out. Looks good.

           Governor,



           Below, I have pasted in an e-mail Bruce sent out this morning as we are

           working together on AGIA communications strategy. I asked him if I could

           go ahead and forward it to you so you can see what we are thinking about

           on all of this. He says we should have answers for you on these

           questions by later on today.

           Subject: Comms decisions to be made by COB today



           I don't mean to presume a deadline, but it would HELP if it was COB

           today for items 1-4 below.

          Lesser points to follow, these are the biggies.
