             I need to go to at least one of the 180 return ceremonies. I'll be reminded that as
             Commander in Chief I should be there to welcome them home at at least one of their events.

             The May 1 event is the 180 ceremony which they would like you to attend .  We do have
             cabinet meeting scheduled for May 1 from 11:00 - 1:00 p . m. The Lt Gov was planning to
             attend this one.  Janice

              Their welcome home ceremony is reported on the news as April 30, but another report is
             May 1. Is one more appropriate for my attendance?
