              Sharon:

              I went through the same line of questioning with Kyle yesterday for 45 minutes. He wants to know our position on
              Knik Arm. What I told him several times is that public funds are involved , anytime public funds are involved,
              officials should perform a reasonable amount of due diligence . That means getting all the information we need to
              evaluate the project so an informed decision can be made. So we are asking hard questions of KABATA. We will
              keep asking hard questions until we are satisfied with the answers.

              I also told him that we just received 80 pages of information this week from KABATA. That information is being
              reviewed by experts at DOT and LAW who will provide input back to us.

              The answer to Kyle' s question of pursuing the project even if it means the state puts more money into it
              could be Privileged or Personal M^
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              The answer to Kyle's question whether the bridge Is a good thing could be:
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              The answer to the question of how Knik Arm compares with Gravina could be:

             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              Kyle has.Frank Richard 's April 22, 2008, letter to KABATA asking a lot of tough questions.

               Kyle has somehow gotten a copy of Frank's letter to KABATA. Its 3 pages of tough questions to them about the
               project and again asking KABATA to education the public and legislators on all the details of the project.

               I don't know how he got it.

               Randy-

               This is what I got from Kyle. He is looking to gauge the Governor's support of the project. Privilege
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                    Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                                                                            Thoughts?



               Yeah - I'm trying to take the pulse of KABATA and the bridge project in the wake of George Wuerch leaving last
               month , and DOT asking some hard questions about the project costs and potential risk to the state.

               I'd want to ask the governor things like whether she supports pursuing the project even if it means the state needs
               to put more money in it, and how she sees the'project in comparison to the Gravina Island bridge.
