              Nice comments from Meyers re: SoS speech .         (Not). Coghill too.        Sheeesh.



              Puzzling why it's the democrats who can be positive and helpful and observant, and folks
              like Meyers have to constantly pick and be negative. I do wish R's could share their
              vision, accomplishments, etc - instead of tear us down when we try to do so. Makes it
              tough to believe in R leggies' attempts to work with us to progress this state.



              Lt. Governor: got your merit sch email. I won't be able to change travel plans this trip,
              have appts upon my return to Juneau on Saturday.



              Thanks for all your help, all you guys - and gals - it was a whirlwind of a couple of days
              - already - and it's just beginning! It shall be fun. And productive. And great for Ak.



              We'll finally make these connections to Ft Benning this evening. Contact.me any time.
