 Dan Fagan is the Don Imus of Alaska! He should be ashamed of himself for referring to Gov.
 Sarah Palin and members of her administration as "crack whores running to their sugar daddy."

 The fact of the matter is, if Palin were a man chauvinists like Fagan wouldn't have a platform to
 stand on. I can't recall one time Fagan referred to any of our former governors, or any other state
 leader for that matter, with such a degrading, disparaging remark.

 Alaskans are sick of his personal attacks on strong, intelligent women leaders in our state.
 Objective policy debate is welcome all day long, but I refuse to sit idly by as Fagan resorts to
 personally attacking Alaska's governor and other women leaders with his sexist comments that
 have no bearing on good public policy. Fagan should stick to the issues or shut up!
