            Jody Simpson (staff to Huggins). will be attending "cheering Gov Palin on from the side
            lines". Those were her words.



            Cheers!

            Thanks, Kelly!     I'll make sure those changes are reflected in the Governor's remarks and
            event info.

            Sen Huggins staff emailed and said he will not be attending due to prior commitment.



           See you all in the morning.

            Governor,



            Here are your remarks and event info for the bill signing (fishing/hunting licenses &
            Guard firefighters) on Monday morning at Ship Creek. I will have a binder prepared for
            you that morning for your convenience. I have not heard whether Senator Huggins has
            confirmed his attendance or not, and so I have worked him into the agenda and your
            remarks, just in case.



            Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or alteration requests with the
            remarks.  Thanks and have a great weekend!
