        Fairbanks Daily News-Miner editor, Rod Boyce, called today and asked for an editorial
        board meeting while the Governor is in town. I hadn't thought of it before because the
        Governor's schedule has been tight and I left a space , that's now filled, for more
        briefings for Barrow. What shall we do? Do you have any heartburn if I say - so sorry, the
        schedule's been packed.
