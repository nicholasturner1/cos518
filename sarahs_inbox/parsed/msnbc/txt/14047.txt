              MESSAGE:

              Governor Palin,




              Good Vandal greetings from Spokane, Washington.



             No doubt you get a tremendous volume of emails, so I'll keep this as short as possible.



             I know Idaho alumni everywhere are so very proud of you. Although we've never met, I am in
             that company.



             I graduated from Idaho in 1973 with a Journalism degree. However, as some of my longtime
             newspaper friends put it, I went to the darkside and jumped into advertising... .and that
             was nearly 35 years ago.



             On April 26th, the Spokane County Vandal Boosters will sponsor the third annual VandalFest
             for Eastern Washington. It's a dinner and auction, with proceeds this year benefiting both
             the Idaho Alumni Association and Vandal Scholarship Fund.



             Each of the last two years, we've been able to come up with some very special auction
                                                                   1




                                                                                                           PRA GSPO1 0014560

             items . They haven ' t necessarily been large items of great value , but rather things that
             are significant for other reasons.



             It struck me today, that an item donated by you, with Alaska signifigance , would be very
             popular at our auction.

             I'm certain you get regular requests such as this , however I hope you can find time to
             consider this one.



             I thank you in advance.



             Regards,
