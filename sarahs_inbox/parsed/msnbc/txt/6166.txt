         Hello,

         I'm checking into it and will let you know. If we don't have an account established is AK
         Cleaners the most convenient since they have the two locations?

         Sorry to hear about Bitney.

         Erika

        Hi E: do we have a contract with Alaska Cleaners - or who is it with? I'll be dropping
        off dry cleaning soon and don't want to wait to get back to juneau to do so. There's an Ak
        Cleaners in wasilla and Anchorage do that would be convenient.
