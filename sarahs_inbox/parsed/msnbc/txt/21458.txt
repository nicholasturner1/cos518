              No I'll take it- just didn't know who he was, saw Nerland's name on it- and hadn't heard
              back from the email last wk.



              Sounds good, tho I doubt state govt can help him with baseball.

              I'm sorry, I must have missed that email. We met Ron at Bruce's Chevron. I think he may be
              one of Kurt's partners. He had requested 15 minutes to talk about their work. I'm sure
              there is an underlying ask for support. I can take the meeting and you can do a stop in,
              if you prefer.

              I don't know if my earlier email this week was received on this: the mtg today with a
              baseball coach(?). Is it still on? Who asked for the mtg, what do they want? Any idea what
              the "ask" is for state govt to help with baseball?



              The guy listed on the mtg doesn't sound familiar, so not sure why it's scheduled.
