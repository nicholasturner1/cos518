               Subject: Energy Package - Administration's position

             Good morning Governor,
             The energy team is working with the House and Senate Finance Committees today. There are many elements
             being discussed at the table and the committees now want the Administration 's position with the goal of moving a
             bill out this afternoon.

             Right now there is an expansion of PCE
             A subsidy for bulk home heating fuel over $3 .00 per gallon up to 600 gallons administered by AEA
             A rebate check - no dollar determined yet between $250 and $1000
             LIHEAP - state and federal income based public assistance for heating costs

             Only the H version includes the 8cents motor fuel suspension right now.

             We will obviously work to encourage a rebate check of at least $800, trying for higher if possible. We will continue
             for fuel tax suspension but no sure Senate will agree.

             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             We need to work with the committees very soon and Randy will need to have a comment at the table later today.

             Thanks, Kelly

              Congratulations on getting this across the goal line. I know how much work and
              effort you put into achieving this outcome and as someone representing a new
              explorer in the state I personally want to thank you and the Governor for
              ensuring that an open and transparent process is in place to develop a pipeline
              and that companies, such as BG, will have access to capacity on that line when
              it is built.

             Janice: Sorry to bother you again , and on a Saturday morning , too. I have also left you a voice mail message on your cell
             phone.

             Our president, Larry Anm, has asked me to inquire whether the Governor would be willing to meet privately with him and
             members of our board of trustees , following her presentation to the Hillsdale cruisers.

             The small group would be about 10-15 folks.

             We have arranged for a room here on the ship for this private meeting, which would be very informal.

             Could you call my cell phone and let me know? Were cruising Tracy Arm right now, but its a strong signal as of now. Cell
             is 517-610-1386.

             Again, sorry to bother you on a Saturday.

             Thanks for your help.

             Dear Janice: Thanks again for speaking with me today. We hope Governor
             Palin will be able to speak to the Hillsdale College cruise group.

             Here is a link to the cruise itinerary:

             http://wwwrssc.com/voyage/details.isp?code=MAR080730

             We would like the Governor to address our group in Juneau on August 2,
             when the ship pulls in at 1 p.m.

             Alternatively, if that is simply not possible, our group will be in
             Anchorage on the evening of July 26 for the start of our pre-cruise land
             program. However, we would much rather have Governor Palin address our
             group in Juneau, if at all possible.

             Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the invitation.

             Thanks again for your help.
