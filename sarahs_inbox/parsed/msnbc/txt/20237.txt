              Washington, DC. August 7, 2008 - In an August 1 letter to U.S. Senate Committee on Banking,
              Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), National Conference of Insurance
              Legislators (NCOIL) leaders spoke out against Congressional efforts to fast-track legislation to create a
              federal Office of Insurance Information (OH)-recommending that their federal colleagues slow down the
              legislative process for further debate and discussion. The letter followed in the wake of aJuly 29 hearing
              during which Sen. Dodd signaled that the Senate could consider a legislative package that may include
              parts of H.R. 5840, the Insurance Information Act of 2008, before adjourning in September.

             NCOIL President Rep. Brian Kennedy (RI) said, "We do not understand the impetus behind moving
             legislation in such an expeditious manner that would substantially affect the governance of insurance
             regulation. There is no crisis in the insurance industry that would justify such swift Congressional
             action-as evidenced by the industry's record profits. The insurance marketplace, unlike federally
             regulated banking institutions and markets, is well-regulated at the State level to protect consumers while

               providing a competitive environment for companies and investors."

               Along with Rep. Kennedy, NCOIL Officers-PresidentElect Sen. James Seward (NY), Vice President Rep.
               Robert Damron (KY), Secretary Rep. Geoge Keiser (ND), and Treasurer Sen. Carroll Leavell (NM)-wrote to
               "request due process" in the consideration of H.R. 5840. The letter-which was distributed to every U.S.
               Senator-urged members not to pursue an even faster track on such a controversial piece of legislation than the
               path pursued in the House and stated:

                     H.R. 5840 is a new proposal in the Senate -though introduced and advanced in the United States
                     House of Representatives in 2008 -and has not been vetted in the Senate or debated by any
                     previous Congress . The measure was reported out of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets,
                     Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises after a markup in which less than 15 of the
                     almost-50 member Subcommittee voted . Even more troubling, the House Committee on Financial
                     Services has yet to debate H.R. 5840.

               NCOIL leaders also requested that Sen. Dodd "not bundle H.R. 5840 with other insurance-related bills, including
               a bill to address the surplus lines market."NCOIL believes that Congress should consider separately the merits of
               each piece of legislation , instead of grouping several bills into one insurance package.

               The NCOIL Officers continued, "We believe that the OR would establish a framework that a future Congress
               could build upon to create and empower a federal insurance regulator, contrary to the original legislative intent
               We also respectfully note that co-sponsors of OFC legislation H.R. 3200, the National Insurance Act, have
               publicly stated that H .R. 5840 would be a step toward that end."

               Reiterating NCOIL concerns previously articulated by Rep. Kennedy at a House Capital Markets Subcommittee
               hearing, the letter argues that H.R. 5840 would:
                   · preempt your state 's laws and consumer protections if the OH determined that they were "inconsistent"
                      with new federal international "agreements"
                   · lay the foundation for an inappropriate federal scheme, such as an Office of National Insurance (ONI) or an
                      optional federal charter (OFC)

               NCOIL-the letter states-"strongly supports the tenets of a state based system of insurance regulation, which
               Congress has acknowledged for so many years . On the ground in the states, legislators and regulators work side-
               by-side to improve insurance regulation and to ensure that companies and consumers benefit from the competitive
               marketplace we have fostered."

              NCOIL has contacted all state Governors, Attorneys General, and insurance supervisors regarding H.R. 5840.
              Legislators have also reached out to the Financial Services Committee and various other Congressional offices to
              discuss their concerns related to the creation of a new federal insurance office.

              NCOIL is an organization of state legislators whose main area of public policy interest is insurance legislation and
              regulation. Most legislators active in NCOIL either chair or are members of the committees responsible for
              insurance legislation in their respective state houses across the country. More information is available at
              www.ncoil.org.

               1.   WASTE MANAGEMENT UNDER PRESSURE TO RAISE ITS BID FOR
                    REPUBLIC
                    Last week, Bill Gates' investment arm BGI, which manages the assets of Cascade
                    Investment, owner of 15.6% of Republic Services, sent a letter to Waste
                    Management saying it should abandon efforts to acquire Republic as "i11-timed and
                    poorly conceived." BGI which also owns 2.3% of Waste Management could well be
                    pushing the company to sweeten its bid. It is becoming increasingly apparent that
                    Waste Management will have to raise its bid by at least $5 per share to be taken
                    seriously by the board or the company's larger shareholders i.e. BGI. A higher bid
                    will be needed to surmount moves last week by Republic's board that adopted a
                    "poison pill" defense that penalizes anyone acquiring more than 10% of the
                    common stock without board approval. Of concern to Waste Management would be
                    to lose its investment grade credit rating were it to offer all cash for Republic,
                    which means the company would likely borrow. Here too it would likely raise debt
                    rather than equity to avoid earnings dilution... Read More s

                    County, NV by agreeing to remediate an unlined landfill near Las Vegas for which it
                    will take an estimated $35 million pretax charge against second-quarter Income.
                    Last month, the EPA ordered Republic to upgrade its now dosed 440 acre Sunrise
                    Landfill which is thought to be contaminating Lake Mead, a drinking water source
                    for Phoenix, southern Nevada and southern California . The EPA estimates that it
                    will cost about $7 million to fix the landfill which Is home to 18 million tons of

                    according to an Ernst & Young report based on data from Dow Jones
                    VentureSource. "We expect to see robust activity' in the future, said Jeff Grabow,
                    head of Ernst & Young's clean-tech unit for the Pacific Northwest. "Its not just

                    million, or $0.54 per share , last year. Revenue rose 11% to $265 .3 million from
                    $238.7 million last year. The company said use of its domestic centers was strong,
                    offsetting weakness in its landfill disposal plants due to project timing. For the

                    The Senate recently passed legislation authored by U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg
                    (D-NJ) to allow states to regulate solid waste processing facilities along rail lines.
                    The rail waste legislation is based on the Clean Railroads Act of 2007 and seeks to
                    close a loophole whereby companies processing solid waste along rail lines could
                    claim exemption from state and local regulation . The new legislation excludes solid

                    the economic conditions of our markets with Texas having strong positive volume
                    growth while Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, and Tennessee have had volume

                    second quarter last year. "Very strong cleanup business performance and
                    diversified growth over multiple service lines combined to produce record first-half
                    performance," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Romano. Waste-

              Don't know why it won't open.

              It is a laundry list of things he wants. Emails, files, correspondence, names and addresses of any and all
              staff that would have any knowledge of watt's firing. Logs, summaries, phone messages and on and on.
              He wants all this by Aug 13t'. Again we have not laid out any game rules yet and he is setting timelines
              on us now. You got to be kidding me.....
