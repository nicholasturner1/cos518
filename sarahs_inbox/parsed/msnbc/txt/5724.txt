        Bill McAllister just called me. He was quite sick today and unable to

        make it to Juneau . With the first day of AGIA hearings , he will be

        covering the hearings tomorrow for his story.



        However , he would love to spend a few minutes with the Governor to

        talk about the first 100 days . He'll be heading in on the first

        flight - so perhaps sometime between 11am and 2pm would work? It most

        likely won ' t be a big story - overshadowed by AGIA . But it ' s our bill,

        so that's good, too.



        Governor, please let us know if we can squeeze him in. Kari, please

        let us know when might be best.



        Thanks,

        Meghan
