             MESSAGE:




             Dear Governor :




                 Congratulations to the new arrival in the family and the

             exciting journey you embarked to the end appointment!!!



                    Truely fun.



               Also i am writing to ask for your support to the new renewable resouces 'bills' that
            have made it to your table.

            I would like to see their success and passage.             I recognize the work and time given to the
            bills

            and have spent time following the 'gavel to gavel' coverage

            to be witness. These are good works -- pass them.

            Thank-you.

            gretchen holbrook
