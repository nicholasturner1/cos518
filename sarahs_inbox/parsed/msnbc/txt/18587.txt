         Subject: Sitka Superior Court




         Larry Cohn with the Judicial Council called on the heels of yesterday 's Judicial Council
         meeting with the applicants for Sitka Superior.



         They are William Carey

         David George

         Jude Pate



         Hey will be delivering       packets over today, and their press release will go out this
         afternoon.  We'll have       45 days from today for the Governor to make her selection. Can we
         look ahead for a block       of time for interviews so that the Governor's selection can be made
         by Oct 24th. This will       be a week after the Special starts, so it could be fairly busy
         with press stuff. I'll       shoot to have the bulk of research done by Oct 10th so we have
         some padding.



         Coming down the pipe for Judges will be Fairbanks Superior and then the big one - Alaska
         Supreme Court.
