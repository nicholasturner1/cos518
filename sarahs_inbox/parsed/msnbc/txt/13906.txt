           What was their committment? Do they now want all those items we're taking out of the
           supplemental, due to our understanding that they're not palmer"s top priority- esp the
           bleachers, recycling and performing arts? And their street isn't even in the supplemental.

           FYI in case this gets brought up if you meet w/Lyda. As I relayed to John, Bill Allen has
           not discussed supplemental w/me.

               I just wanted to take a moment of your time Kris to thank you and the Governor for your
            attention to the City of Palmer which is the service center for about 21,000 people that
            surround the City . I have genuinely enjoyed our relationship with the Governor and her
            staff and truly believe in her administration.




               i would like to ask a favor : Please relay to the Governor my steadfast commitment to
            the Palin administration and know that I can be counted on anytime for anything if she
            needs me.




             Most sincerely,




             John Combs



             Mayor for the City of Palmer




             If you wish to reply , please send it to my office e-mail : jcombs@palmerak.org



             Thank you.
