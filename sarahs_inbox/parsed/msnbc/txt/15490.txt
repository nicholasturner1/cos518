            I'll let Scheduling answer be it looks like at least one other thing will be added to
            sched during the time you're suggesting for bill signing tomorrow...

            Governor,



            I'd like to check with you about approving a 15 minute slot, tomorrow, Tuesday (Janice and
            Kris discussed the time frame) at about 2:30pm to invite Senator Bill Wielechowski to the
            Anchorage office to sign SB 185 (sex offender/registration) which is due Wednesday, May
            28th.



            Sen Wielechowski only has 2 bills this year and the other is SB 202 (REAL ID), which will
            most likely become law without signature.



            If this is okay, I'd like to email an invitation to the Senator this afternoon to see if
            his schedule can accommodate the time.
                                                                   1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0018284
