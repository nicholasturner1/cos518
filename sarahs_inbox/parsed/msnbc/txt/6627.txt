         Dear Kerry,




        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        I would like to commend you on your budget cuts. I am sure you had to make some tough
        choices, but I do believe you are doing what is best for Alaska. Many thanks and stay
        true to what is best for our State.



        Sincerely,



        Kerry Sticks
