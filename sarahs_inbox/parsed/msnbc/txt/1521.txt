  Morning, Todd! I just emailed Erika to get her to confirm whether a Governor is only considered to have
  served twice if their terms are split - which would make Hickel and Egan our only two-time governors. This
  is different from having served consecutive terms. I'll let you know what she says.

  The safest route would probably be to acknowledge that, at 12 years, Egan was our longest serving
  governor and, to date, the only one born in AK (Valdez). Again, I'll let you know what I find ASAP. Thanks!

  Kate

  Hi Todd,

  Here are the introductions as requested, with 2 or 3 sentences about each Lady. Erika will print out for
  you. Please let me know if I can else.

  Thank you!
