               We are blessed ! What a great team to work with.

               Also, I just appreciate your willingness to call everyone onto the court to do the job.
               Thanks for including me in that effort.



               You've got great instincts, you've demonstrated proper and solid leadership in the last
               year, and we are all thankful to have you as our governor. You are there for some special
               purposes that have begun to unfold and I am thrilled to be rowing with you!

              Awesome job today on budget!!!  Thank you all so much for your great work. That process
              resulted in not only a great work product for Alaska, but great messaging too.



              Thanks very much.
