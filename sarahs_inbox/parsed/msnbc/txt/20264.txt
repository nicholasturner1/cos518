          Just talked with Mitch Diementieff in Fairbanks. Asked him whether we needed our break-up
          boots in Nenana. Said regular shoes will be fine.



           The bridge area was boggy, but Mitch says DOT did a nice job of cutting the grass and
          fixing things up for the occasion.



           Said it's not raining at the moment .         Let's hope we can bring some of today's beautiful
          sunshine to Fairbanks and Nenana.
