            Governor,



            I am trying to get a hold of James Rowell, but here are directions as

            written on the Kenai Landing website:



            Stay on the Sterling Highway until Soldotna, about 1 hour (do not turn

            onto Kenai Spur Road to Kenai City, but continue through Soldotna and

            cross the Kenai River Bridge). At the first stop light, immediately

            after the Bridge, turn right onto Kalifornski Beach Road (K-Beach Road).

            Drive 6 miles. Continue past Aimes Bridge Access (Aimes Bridge to

            Kenai). Stay on K-Beach Road for 2 miles, watch for the sign .... and turn

            right onto Cannery Road. Drive 1 mile and turn into Kenai Landing.



            Kate
