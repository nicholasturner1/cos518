            FYI.

            We can discuss the details on Monday or as your schedule permits.

            I believe it is your mutual responsibilty to warn Governor Palin
            that the most concerned techs at Alyeska and Prudhoe consider
            the Petroleum Systems Integrity Office as nothing more than
            bureaucratic rhetoric and intend to pass on their perceptions to
            the interested parties in DC to achieve safety in their workplace
            and protection for the integrity of their facilities.

           since I have no direct personal communications link to Governor Palin,
           except first class mail, I believe it is your separate or joint responsibility
           that she is not blind-sided from Washington and relevent media releases,
           regarding perceptions of in-effective State oversight of Alyeska and Prudhoe.

           As Governor Palin is well aware, I have special respect for her and desire
           that she is aware of the conduct by those who officially represent her.
           Thanks,
           Chuck
