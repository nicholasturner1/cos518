              Dear Governor Palin,

                    This came to me today . It may or may not be the person you recently appointed. The
              date of birth would probably give you an idea. I thought it better to pass it on than
              not.  Talis

              Talis Colberg,



              Richard Carle DOB 8-9-64 is currently facing the following charges that              I am aware of:



              Stalking in the 2nd Degree

              Violating Conditions of Release

              PTRP for an underlying Assault4DV




              Richard Carle DOB 10-27-68 is currently facing these charges:



              Driving With License Revoked     ( 2 separate charges)

              Felony DWI

             Violating Conditions of Release



             Also , James Scott is handling both of these cases. He might be able to provide more
             information.   He is in a jury trial today - so he will be busy for most of the day today.



             Also, again , I am not trying to poke my nose where it does not belong. If this is
             something I should butt -out of, just let me know . I only recognized the name, and thought
                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 _0007816

              it might be information that the people who appointed Richard Carle might want to know.



              If you need anything else, please let me know.



              Nick

              Talis Colberg,




             Just wanted to drop a short line regarding a recent appointment made by Gov. Palin.
             Richard Carle of Hydaburg (on located on Prince of Wales Island , near Ketchikan) was
             appointed to the Northern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission .  I'm not sure who this
             individual is, but we are currently prosecuting two different Richard Caries.




                                                           2




                                                                                                       PRA GSP01 _0007817

              One is Richard S. Carle, date of birth 10-27-1968.




              The other is Richard Carle, date of birth 8-9-1964. This individual is from Prince of
              Wales Island, so this might be the same individual Gov. Palin appointed.




              Just wanted to give you an FYI. It is none of my business how Gov. Palin makes
              appointments, or if this information is relevant, but I thought I would pass it along just
              in case it might be something that could save Gov. Palin a future situation. Feel free to
              disregard if this is not important.




              Hope you are doing well.
