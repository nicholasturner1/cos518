          Actions speak louder than words. As a ratification of the presumed success of AGIA, this
          Anadarko news - first real exploration for GAS -- is in some ways even better than the
          Sokol proclamation.   It is precisely the buzz we want and need to build credibility and
          momentum in our process.
