          We may have some UA students stop by - hopefully the won't eat us out of house and home.
          Their PR gal, Dani, is coming at 5pm to film a three-minute MTV bit at the house... Sharon
          has details if you need em.

          Frank also rsvp'd 4 Juneau supporters. This event will be very low key tho--people will
          be in and out because they have to vote at 6:00 and participate in their district

                  Things look fine. This will just be low key as the Governor stated. I

                  Hello,



                  Just a quick recap for tonight' s event:



                  Two screens set-up in the Library & Ballroom;    seating for 25 ( and extra

                  chairs available ). Since there ' s not a firm guest count it helps so it

                  doesn 't look sparse, then chairs can easily be added as they're needed.



                  Dining table set up in Main Hall with beverages     & beer   ( in buckets w.

                  ice), wine, & coffee along with appetizers.



                 The Dining room- I ' ll add some chairs so people can use that room to

                 mingle and visit.



                 Media: you won't lose your cable in the mst.bedroom this time. Volume

                 adjustments will be next to the projectors- not.

                 hooked into the House system and you can change the channels.




                                                          2




                                                                                                      PRA GSP01 _0011454

                  Ivy- do you have a guess/estimate on numbers?



                  Let me know if you'd like to change anything!

                  Thanks,

                  Erika

                  I think 5:00 pm to 6 : 30ish. The results will be trickling in--we might

                  not learn much in terms of results , but it will be fun and low key.

                  to

                  legislators and staff and will know better afterwards and will

                  available I can keep the table stocked - we don't know how many

                  interpret it as

                  a big deal if they think staff will be called in for OT or it'll

                  be a

                  burden on staff... So, I think Ivy and I can handle folks

                  Ivy- how many do you think?
