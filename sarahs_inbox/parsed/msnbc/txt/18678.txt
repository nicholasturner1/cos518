                Subject: Western storm

              Just an FYI for you

              I received some calls regarding a storm that is currently hitting the western coastal area of Alaska . The prelim '
              reports are that Kivalina may have to evacuate some folks later today if the storm picks up in intensity . In Nome a
              road washed out but presents no immediate problem for the community. Later today there will be high tides and
              heavy wind expected so that may cause more problems as the day goes on. DMVA/Emergency Management has
              made contact with folks out in the western communities and will monitor the situation . As things develop I will
              keep you informed.
