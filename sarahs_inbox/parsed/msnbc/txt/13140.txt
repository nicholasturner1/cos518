            Pls let me know when you find oput what all those positions were that were cut (besides
            the obvious- DPS and oil/gas). Again, I can't imagine advocating for increasing the
            operating budget from where leggies have reduced it. Thanks

            Subject: Operating budget




            What are the positions that leggies cut in operations, besides DPS and oil/gas? Pls
            advocate for those positions, but I can't imagine why we'd push for more new state
            employees outside those two areas, unless I'm missing something. AP reported we're asking
            them to restore 148 new positions? Outside the two areas, I don't support increasing what
            they cut.
