              Governor.

              My understanding is that Leo forwarded the e-mail he received from you to SE Region Director Mal Menzies.
              Apparently Mal then shared the e-mail chain with other DOT employees when he asked for their assistance in
              responding to the question about how much work was occurring on the Juneau Access project. While these DOT
              employees are the persons with the information Mal was trying to get back to Leo, they are also strong supporters of
              the project. I certainly do not know for sure, but I suspect it was one of these employees that leaked the e-mail.
