             Attorney General Colberg, Tom, Larry, Craig - I wanted to especially recognize Ruth's efforts
             helping us this week. On only a moments notice, she rearranged her schedule to come to
             Anchorage to be at the Tuesday (Aug 19) press availability, and ended up spending the rest of
             the week here to represent us before APOC in the complaint filed late Weds against DNR.
               Hopefully she will get back to Juneau today (Saturday). She was the primary spokesperson
             at several long sessions before APOC, and In between she spent her time getting prepared for
             the APOC hearings and coordinating with DEC and DNR and others in the AGs office. She
             even agreed to be interviewed by Channel 11 news, which I think Ed especially appreciated as
             he got more than his share of media attention this week. Somewhere in there, she also
             completed filing of the Chuitna un-suitability petition brief on DNR's behalf, it was submitted
             Weds and was a significant effort in and of itself.

             Cam' Leonard was also a tremendous help, partially all day and into the evening on Friday as
             he participated in the negotiations and the spoke extensively at the APOC hearing. He was
             especially helpful keeping us focused in our interagency discussions.

             Ruth and Cam - thank you!

             Dick

             rulings:
