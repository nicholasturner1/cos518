               Subject: Why is no one in the Trooper Office not willing to answer my request? ATM Fraud of Keith Moyer's
                        Key Bank account.

             To Whom It May Concern:

             I've made repeated attempt to get a copy of an investigation of ATM Bank fraud.
             By certified Mail and emails to the Officers Shanigan and Guymon. I did not get any responses to my requests
             after 2 weeks.
             On 919/2008 I tried in person. I was told to contact you.

             I would like a copy of your report:
             Report on Edward Cheeks investigation of ATM fraud of Keith Moyer's Key Bank account
             Investigation was conducted around 6/7/07.
             Please let me know what is needed to receive a copy of this report

             Its been months I tried to get this report and for the last 3 week have made numerous attempts.
             I believe the Troopers are with holding this report I have court documents, there are recordings of Mr. Cheeks
             stating he did not have POA and used my ATM card after that point 6 times. We have videos.
             What do I have to do to get this report? Why is no one in the Trooper Office not willing to answer my request?


             Regards, Keith
