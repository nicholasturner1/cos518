            Can it get wrapped up right now- before I get in . I emailed the corrections already. Who's
            working on it?

            Governor, Bill McAllister would like a few minutes with you today to

            talk about Senator Green' s request to expand the call. We need to make

            sure the letter has been released before the interview.



            Also, Steve Quinn with AP would like a phoner with you regarding Trig.

            He is doing a lengthy story on you and the baby to run this weekend. Al

            Grillo would like to snap a few photos for the story.
