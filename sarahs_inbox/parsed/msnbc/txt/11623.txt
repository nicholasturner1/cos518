             Yeah- we may want to think about changing location for press availability . I had assumed
             Erika and staff would have thought to un - decorate from the October Christmas decorations
             in the house - at least the very dead tree and wreaths to be removed ... I asked Erika what
             the plan had been to remove things like the tree - she said she was waiting to hear from
             me. Hope I didn ' t offend, but I told her it's Jan 29 , press will be here in a few hours,
             and some reporters may make the Christmas decor the focus and / or brunt of jokes . May have
             to move location back to capitol bldg if everything ' s a mess.

             No- astrik overall on title of document be we know we didn't keep track of every event,
             every hour of every day. We just need the travel sched presented in context.



            Also - the Christmas tree is still up- it's deader than a doorknob . It hogs a lot of the
            ballroom and since we have a meeting in there today , I've asked that it be taken down.
            Hope I didn ' t offend anyone with the request , but the Christmas decorations may be the
            butt of jokes as we have all the press coming over here this afternoon after all the House
            leadership meets here for lunch.



             Thing move slowly in govt , eh?!        :)

             Jan 29th and it looks like Christmas Eve in here still - beautiful , but some may think I'm
             too lazy to put decorations away . If I knew where they go , especially the tree , I'd have
             done it.

             Governor - the only days that I can think of that may be incomplete

             would be the May 15 through June 30, 2007 that we do not have hard

             calendar copies for.       The other months were taken directly off the hard

             copies of what was on the calendar. Do you just want those months

             marked?    Thanks, Janice

             Pls make sure when submitting year-end travel sched that you put an

             astrik * by the title that explains it's incomplete - or however you can

             describe that not every event or appt is accounted for on every day.

             Thanks!
