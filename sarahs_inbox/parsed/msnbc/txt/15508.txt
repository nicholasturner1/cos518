                Steve,

                This morning our office sent you a fax from Mayor Begich 's office (rec'd at 5: 30 pm Friday) on energy
                priorities. Please see his media advisory for press conference tomorrow . Were you able to follow-up with
                his office? We want to make sure we're ahead on this.
