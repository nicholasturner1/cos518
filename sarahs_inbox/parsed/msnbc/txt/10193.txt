              Sounds like Bowles is in the meeting room with Mulva.

              Great.  I was under the impression that he would be giving you a cover letter and
              executive summary.  Good luck!

               Governor,




                We spent a considerable amount of time today in AGIA team meetings trying to plan for
              friday evenings announcement and/or press conference. It is very clear to the team that
              the Conoco proposal is likely to elicit significant interest from the media and could be
              the subject of the toughest questions . Is it possible to get any materials Mr. Mulva
              provided today? That could help us prepare for and anticipate those questions.




                Joe




                                                                2




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0008140
