             MESSAGE:

             My name is Jaren Hoffman, and I am the Vice-Chairman of Alaska College Republicans. I am
             interested in bringing Congressman Ron Paul , and Mike Gravel to Alaska . I am not a ardent
             supporter of Congressman Paul or former Senator Gravel, but this is primarily for the
             student body. I was wondering if you might be interested helping in bringing either of
             them into the state; not that you would be supporting them, but because of their
             respective connection  to Alaska and/or attraction from students from Alaska,     but
             perhaps encouraging both Presidential candidates to come.



             Thank you for your time,

             Jaren Hoffman
