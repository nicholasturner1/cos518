   Subject : Case Study on Suicide
  Governor,

  One of my goals in coming to work for you was to keep you in touch with the people of
  Rural Alaska - in meaningful ways.

  I hope this report on Akiak's problems will give you some insight into Alaska's suicide
  epidemic. I know it's an issue close to your heart.

  My hope is to pass on some of this information to some non-profits, to see if they might
  help Akiak finish its playground and get some additional resources for mental health.

  Thanks,

  Rhonda
