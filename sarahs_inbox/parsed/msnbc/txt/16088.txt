            Subject:                 URGENT Lyda green dropping out of race


            Governor-



            Channel 2 just called to say that lyda just issued a press release saying she will not
            seek reelection.  She says it is because of the AGIA process. She says it has the support
            of many of her constituents but she thinks it is a disasterous move for the state. Mike
            ross would like a comment from you. He knows you are travelling to fbks. If it is at all
            possible to give him a comment - he is at 762 9248.
