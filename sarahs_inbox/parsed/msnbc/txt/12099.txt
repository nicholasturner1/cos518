             Thank you - and if they decide not to release then they ' ll be explaining that decision to
             Alaskans and our lawmakers . I won ' t be able to defend their decision because I won't be
             agreeing with it.

             We have kept Marty and the commissioners from direct communication with TC. I have
             already been in communication with them about this and they are working through how to do
             it.  They intend to have a decision by Monday .  I have plans to talk with them again
             Friday morning and can convey your sense of urgency.

              Would you place a call to TC letting them know I encourage allowing                   lawmakers to see
             their ' 04 proposal?
