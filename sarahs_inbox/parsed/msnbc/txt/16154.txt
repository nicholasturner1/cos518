           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin




           It was a pleasure meeting you today. My daughter was thrilled. I thought I would send you
           a link to your picture with her. I wanted to say something to you today, but it was too
           crowded.




           I just wanted you to know that Shayna has provided 17 years of living with an angel. She
           is sometimes a challenge, but we wouldn't have had it any other way. She teaches us
           something everyday and people respond to her with smiles.




           Good luck to you and your family.


                                                               1
