              Hi de ho hey!
              I am not the type that comments -however, I am pleased what a strong person you are , how you feel
              about Alaska , the potential, the direction you are taking , what you see for the future and trying to direct it
              in the right way. There will always be naysayers and jealous peple because of the person you are. All I
              can say is "THANK YOU" for being the incredible person you are, don 't change and keep fighting for what
              you believe in and especially for the care you have shown to the people in Alaska. You ARE a breath of
              fresh air....don't give up, never surrender (got that from the movie Galaxy Quest) Tee Heel Thank you for
              taking this moment to read this.

              Surely Shirley Spurlock...A person that has been here since 1970, and it was because I joined the Air
              Force, stationed at Elmendorf on Jan 26, 1970 and remained and it is people like you that have caused
              my continuous participation in this state ...THANK YOU!
