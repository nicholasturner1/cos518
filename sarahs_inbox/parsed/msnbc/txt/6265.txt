        I probably sound grumpy on this - but sheeeesh !              Hopefully this was just a Bradner spin.

        Pat- we'll hopefully be meeting on ppt soon. The articles in yesterday's ADN and J of C
        sounded like a one-eighty departure from the consistent message re: ppt NOT being "sound".
        I was asked to respond yesterday by a few reporters in Juneau, and also by legislators who
        may now think we're confused... as they still expect the sp session call this fall and
        were surprised to read your comments. My response was that I haven't changed my mind about
        the need to revisit ppt this fall.
