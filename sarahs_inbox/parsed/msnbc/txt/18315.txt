        Frank,

        I was able to track down Colonel Folger. He said that once a guide submits paperwork, it
        sits at ADF&G waiting to be entered into the system, sometimes for up to a year. So
        although the hunt that resulted in the clients being overlimit for black bear occurred in
        spring 2006, the violation went unnoticed for quite a while until the hunt report was
        entered into a computer. At that point, an investigation started. In the course of the
        investigation, the troopers also examined the paperwork for the October 2005 hunt and
        discovered Jeremiah's paperwork violation.   Please call if you need any more information.

        723-2109.

        Cora
