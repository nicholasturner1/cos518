            Dear Mr. Hay:

           Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging response
           to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.

           I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
           under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.

           I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget
           goals to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.

           I appreciate hearing from you!

                                                   Sincerely,

                                                   Sarah Palin
                                                   Governor

           Your red pen is working great ! It is very refreshing to find we have been given a Governor with the character to
           do what is right for the majority of the people and with great regard for the "special interest" groups that are
           upset...special "disregard" for them takes more "guts" (assurance and peace ) than any politician I've seen in 50
           years or more. Now, that you've made them aware of your real intentions it won't be any surprises when you start
           really making budget progress by clearing out the many who do little or nothing and have been for years.
           My only concern is replacing you when you defeat Lisa for that Senate seat and reform the Washington crowd.
           Please make a thorough clean up here before you leave. Thanks to you and Praise to Our Father in Heaven for
           making you our governor ! Our prayers are with you.

           May He Guide Your Every Thought and Act,
           James Hay
