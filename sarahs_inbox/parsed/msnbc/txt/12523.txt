                 Subject : 2013 2-stroke Motor Regulation Proposal
                Hello James,

                      Please see the attached letter regarding our comments on the DNR 's 2013 2-stroke regulation
                proposal. As you know, we did not support the original 2010 language because we felt it was arbitrary
                and unnecessarily restricted users at times when there was no identified violations of water quality
                standards. We do, however, support the 2013 date as a reasonable compromise that will serve the
                interest of the river and all users. We believe this additional time will give all boaters adequate time to
                adjust to the proposed change.

                Respectfully Submitted,

                Dwight Kramer
                KAFC Chairman
