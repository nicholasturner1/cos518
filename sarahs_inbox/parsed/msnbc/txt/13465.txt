            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

              Congrats on the new addition to your family. May God bless you & your family.

            As of now you must have recieved a ton of a-mails regarding AEL&P & the power issue.Here
            is one more of the same but I had to write what we will be facing if this is not dealt
            with a way other than paying approx.. 50cts a kw.

            We live year all year round since last 7 years , have a family bussiness downtown & our
            main revenue comes from the tourists in the summer.Our store power bill used to be about
            $1000-$1200

            every month during the summer months.

            I hope you can imagine if we have to pay an extra $15000-$25000

           a year HOW MUCH MORE BUSSINESS WE WILL NEED TO DO TO MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY IN THIS
           ALREADY COMPETITIVE MARKET.HOW WILL WE SURVIVE ALL YEAR ROUND WITH THIS KIND OF EXTRA
           EXPENCE not taking into consideration the home power bills for ourselves & our employees?

           If there is a calamity or an emergency in my bussiness I cannot increase the price of my
           product to cover the expence of the emergency .I have to bear the loss & move on. Why can't
           AEL&P?

           All over the USA.IF THERE IS A CALIMITY OR EMERGENCY PRICE HIKE IS FROZEN,WHY NOT IN
           JUNEAU, ALASKA?

           What happened to all the profits it has been making or should have made being in
           bussiness so long.

                                                                  I

            As monoply is critisised all over the USA, WHY ARE WE LETTING THIS HAPPEN IN JUNEAU UNDER
            YOUR LEADERSHIP.

            I STILL REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE ELECTED AS GOVERNOR,WE WERE GLAD THAT WE HAVE A PERSON WHO
            CARES FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE & LOCALS.

            I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT DISSAPOINT US.

                                                                 RAJ.
