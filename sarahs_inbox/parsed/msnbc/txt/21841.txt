               Governor, don't worry about it! I know how swamped you are right now. I'd love to see
               you-any time, but I understand completely that you're focussed on ACES. (I'm on the 10th
               floor all day if you do go all the way out of your way-which IS NOT neccessary. I'm more
               than happy to keep you stocked w coffee.
