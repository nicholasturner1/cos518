            Hello Governor,

            First of all- thanks for adding so much fun to the fundraiser with the stories from Dennis Egan and the
            Gruenings. That was perfect!

            Just to clarify-so I know we're on the same page.
            The House will be alcohol -free almost... We will need champagne for some celebrations (could be locked in
            basement closet). In the kitchenette fridge (2"d. floor) there will only be a small bottle of wine (or 2) and a few
            beers.

            With such a small amount it will be very easy to keep an eye on things . We will just make purchases on an as
            needed basis, so we won 't have the huge inventory and the temptation.

            If I don't hear back I'll assume that I got it right!

            Enjoy Cordova!
            Erika
