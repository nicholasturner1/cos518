              Subject: transparent, accountable state agencies
              Dear Charlie,

              Lynn Canal Conservation has been advocating protecting the outstanding salmon spawning and
              rearing habitat inside the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve from preventable impacts from
              32-passenger twin 150 horsepower commercial jet boat tours since 2000. Our past involvement
              is well documented in the administrative record.

              Having a scientific basis is key to good decision-making. Providing the public with that
              scientific basis is good policy and makes for transparent , accountable government.

              The 2008 ADFG recommendations for the commercial jet boat tour route are the first from the
              Palin administration, and represent a significant departure from the precautionary management
              of past ADFG recommendations. Since April 29, LCC has unsuccessfully tried to ascertain
              ADFG's scientific basis for those recommendations through a series of 3 records requests. As of
              today, July 3, we are no closer to learning that basis than we were on April 29.

              What we have learned is that "there is not a central file system within the department containing
              a single or central Chilkat River file for 2008." That the individual who was central to decision-
              making stated "existing public records will likely not provide answers to the specific questions
              posed in your requests for scientific rationale." That the local ADFG office - even though it was
              involved in formulating the recommendations - has been instructed not to provide us with
              information and instead we must go through Anchorage.

              Since ADFG seems unable/unwilling to provide its scientific basis, can we correctly assume that
              there was no scientific basis upon which ADFG reversed precautionary management of some of
              the best salmon habitat inside the Preserve, and Southeast Alaska?

               Tom and Dick,



              Thought you might enjoy this picture of some the Yukon crew with Governor S. in CA. Our season is very slow, so
              we have been sending resources to the L-48 as we determine there is not a need to retain them in state. So far we
              have sent 19 crews, 15 of which are village Type II crews; the others are agency Type I or Type IIA crews. In
              addition we have 73 DOF staff on assignment and the Interagency Type I IMT goes to number one on the rotation
              list this Friday.

              Dear Governor Palin, You probably already have it, if not here is the state supreme court decision from
              this morning. The Lt Gov.'s decision to allow Water 3 on the ballot based on our advice was affirmed.
              The matter will go to the voters. The mining industry will not be happy . The anti-Pebble people will
              probably be happy. Talis

              The Supreme Court issued an order in this case today sustaining Judge Blankenship's ruling that
              07WTR3 is appropriate for the ballot (attached). A decision will follow later.

              The Court rejected all of the challenges to 07WTR3 (interpretation, appropriation, special legislation, and
              ballot summary and statement of cost).

               Thank you everyone for the huge amount of effort you all have put into this year -long effort. I could not have done
               it without each of you, particularly Joanne and Dave on the opinions and briefs , and the advisory team (Craig,
               Ruth and Cam) who ultimately became my moot court on everything from beginning to end . Thank you, thank
               you, thank you!!

               Now on to the mixing zone initiative litigation. Our first brief is due in September!
