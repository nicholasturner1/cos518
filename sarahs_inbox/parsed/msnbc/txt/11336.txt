             I emailed Ivy tonight and it just may help a little bit. I don't know that full-time is
             really necessary but I've asked for her help.



             Thanks for providing time for us. Dan and I are in conference now working through them.
             It isn't quite as bad as we thought, but there are still a lot to get done in the next 8
             days.



             Thanks for your support.

             leggies to fill b and c spots, do you want ivy to come help for a day or two? I haven't
             asked her yet, but knowing her (and Annette who'd be generous to help out by lending Ivy)
             she'd be willing. I'm guessing.



             Leggies aren't going to give us any breaks, so the sooner we get names in front of them,
             the better. They'll be looking for reasons to ding us this session.

             This wk is packed with AML folks coming and going into my office, but I've tried to clear
             a big chunk of time to get b and c issues time to be addressed. Thanks
