                By Dennis Zaki - Alaska Senate president Lyda Green is trying to block governor Sarah Palin from
                seeing her son graduate boot camp Thursday at Fort Benning, Georgia.

                                                                                                           graduate boot camp
                speech can't be at 6 p.m. because the storms over the weekend interfered with              Thursday at Fort
                many of the flights into Juneau and senators would be coming into town
                throughout the day Tuesday. Yet, a check with Alaska Airlines showed over
                150 available seats Monday, and 125 seats available today from Anchorage. That's not counting
                legislators already booked on flights. Turner's claim is obviously a smokescreen.

                A mother supporting her child at boot camp is as real as it gets.

                Green has some explaining to do to her constituents in Wasilla with family members in the military.

               And support our troops.
