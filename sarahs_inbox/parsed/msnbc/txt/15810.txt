           MESSAGE:

           Please say yes to John McCain if he asks you to be his VP. You represent the people of my
           generation who are fed up with politicians who can't or won't do what is best for the
           country.  I know Alaska needs you also, but if you went national Alaska would still
           benefit tremendously as well as everyone else.



           You've got the courage and conviction to fight for what is needed! AND we (America) need
           you!



           Thanks for listening and God Bless!
