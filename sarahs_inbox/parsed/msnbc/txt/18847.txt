           I'll work with Janice on scheduling these. The only other one that comes to - immediate -
           mind is NEA, which was requested by Abbey. As I mentioned Janice faxed up a list and I'll
           review this weekend and go over w/her on Monday. We'll have a report/status for your
           return on Tuesday.

          Appts we need to make before we're accused of avoding these issues (pls sched for my New
          Orleans return):



          MEA presentation



          AIDEA bd presentation ( tho Ron doesnt need to give the presentation - i want to know where
          they are with the study)



          Rep Nueman ' s issues (half hr?)



          Are there others that we're accused of avoiding lately?
