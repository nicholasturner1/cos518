            ask her what she thinks of knik arm crossing.
            i think KABATA should wise up and realize until they get their "creative " private sector
            financing in place, there will not be the adamant public support for continuing to throw more
            money at the crossing - not when the feds are saying it won't be built on their dime.

            feel her out for what she thinks about it
