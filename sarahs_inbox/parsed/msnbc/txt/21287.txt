              Does it make sense to take over my own scheduling? I dont want to offend anyone, but the
              things we've missed in scheduling have been sometimes pretty embarrassing. Please don't
              forward this.



              The only solution I can come up with is to take on more of the scheduling responsibility-
              and it sounds like others are happy to have me do it.



             Unless there's anyone else on staff who'd be very efficient and detailed-oriented, then I
             think I'd better start researching the events and appts myself beforehand so we are better
             prepared... and also have more complete official records of daily activities.



             Can you think of any other solution beside me taking it on?

              Mike - could u track down where the principals speech is this morning?

              I haven't heard back from Lynne on it.



              And any other scheduled events- I know there are plenty today- nothing's on the calander
              again and it make for an inefficient use of time to try to remember these events/appts
              without having them recorded on the ached. I know it's been a frustrating process to get
              the scheduling to run smoother- I think if I can just start plugging into the official
              calander things that have to be there , then we ' ll save time and I can get on with other
              things. I'm happy to do it myself be it's still not working efficiently and I spend quite
              a bit of time chasing down event details.
