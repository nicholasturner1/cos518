         Great, would also recommend that press inquiries get directed to Annette since she knows
         more about what her Dept is doing and has done to address issues.

        You may want to schedule a meeting with Annette to brief you on steps DOA has taken
        through the last few months to clean up ETS (our IT group) and to ensure proper procedures
        (or not) were followed related to contracts for VOIP (voice over internet protocol), E911,
        ALMR (the penultimate turf war between DMVA and DOA).



         We've had concerns expressed to our office that we've talked with Annette about, Rachael
        Petro, and Mike T. Not sure whether they were ever elevated to you.



         I've just heard that both Con Bunde and Eddie Burke have been asking around after these
        issues so I don't want you blindsided without an understanding of what DOA has done and is
        doing to address the issues.

           Through the months we've been feeding everything we're hearing either to DOA or Mike or
          both.



           I've got to stop traveling so I don't have to send you so many emails with heads ups...
