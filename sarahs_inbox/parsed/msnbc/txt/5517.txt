          Thanks. Yes, very odd comments in Ogan's note. Hopefully that will get straightened out
          soon so I won't have to be a middleman in coveying messages . I know I've never spoken
          about his competency and or being "unfit to be on the third floor", so he was given
          misinformation re: any decisions I've made on DNR personnel and any message that I've sent
          to DNR concerning him.
