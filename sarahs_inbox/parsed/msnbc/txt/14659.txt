            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I want to first congratulate you on welcoming your new child into the world. What a
            blessing indeed!




            I am writing as a long standing vendor (since 1994) of the Tanana Valley Farmers Market
            Association and a current Board member to ask you to please allocate the state funds
            requested for our community' s Farmers Market in the amount of $100,000: Market Facilities
            Expansion and Improvements (HD 7-11)




            I enthusiastically add my support to the many community members here in the interior that
            have come to rely on our state's oldest Farmers Market for the highest quality locally
            grown and produced products.  These funds would not only support the continued growth and
            essential development of the market, but would also support expanding and improving the
            newer location in efforts to continue to make room for the growing community's demand for
            fresh food.



            Please vote to allocate these funds to the Tanana Valley Farmers Market, which represents
            an essential part of the food supply and demand here in the interior. With rising costs
            of supplies originating from the lower 48, we only stand to benefit greatly from growing
            and maintaining our local farmers market to provide us with the finest and freshest
            produce available.  Thank you in advance for your support and consideration.
                                                                 1
