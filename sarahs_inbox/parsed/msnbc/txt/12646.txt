           Hi J- when does Hannah leave? I have a good candidate in mind for replacement, someone who
           could work in the Anchorage office (while hopefully we'll get to snag you more often out
           of the Juneau office during tourist season and bring you up to where it's hopping in
           Anchorage!)... and then figuring out the Juneau locale needs later.
