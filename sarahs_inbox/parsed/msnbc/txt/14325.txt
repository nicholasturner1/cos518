          Subject :                Guard Welcome


          When we do the Welcome Home for the Guard next week we can announce hunting/fishing lic
          fee break for soldiers. Will the bill be ready to sign- or other bills by that time?
          Janice- pls make sure we have correct info on date on that- news reports still give two
          different dates for welcome home ceremony.
