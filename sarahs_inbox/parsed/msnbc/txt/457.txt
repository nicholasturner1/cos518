  Depart : Anchorage at 7:50pm.
  Arrive: Juneau at 9:31 pm.
  Seat: 13A


  T. 5/8 10: 15am . Security Camera training

  you'd like to attend.

  --Low key function. You'll need to sign the awards before the event. For the program you'll read the
  names of the winner(s)
    and present the award(s) to them. You're not the keynote speaker, so it should be pretty straight
