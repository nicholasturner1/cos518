           Subject.: Untruths




           It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the DPS budget and
           contract results... especially in light of how hard you all worked to increase funds and
           provide tools that DPS claimed they needed to do their job. Your recent op-ed was great
           but seems to have been overlooked by some.

             There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union", and this is unfair
           to you, to the whole administration, and most importantly to all Alaskans who desire and
           deserve truth. Please share your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on
           your work product and our committment to public safety can be countered with the truth.
           Thank you
