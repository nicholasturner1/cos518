                  Subject: boards info

                You have 121 boards, in 104 cities, with a total of 1096 members. Interesting.

                I pulled up the info for the Close Up kids that are in town today.

                Plugged through a lot of the Leg . Conf. list with Mike today and now I'm in the process of putting a s hort list
                together of people we think we are ready to vet through you. I think we should do about 10 a day until next
                Wednesday, Feb 14 , which is the absolute deadline for turning in the Leg . Conf list.
