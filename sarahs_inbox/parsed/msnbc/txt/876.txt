Anchorage - Former Alaska State Trooper Daniel Scott,

45, entered a No Contest plea last week for sexually

assaulting three Alaska Native women in Aniak between

2002 and 2004. The plea came on the same day his trial

was scheduled to begin in Bethel on those and other

related charges.



Under the terms of the plea, Scott will spend four

years in jail and must register as a sex offender for

15 years after completion of this jail term and any

parole that may be available.
