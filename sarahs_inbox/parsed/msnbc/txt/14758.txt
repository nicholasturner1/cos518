           MESSAGE:

           You are truly an inspirational parent and an exemplification of how family and work can
           co-exist.  I wish you, and your family, the best of luck and will keep you in my thoughts
           and prayers.



           Keep bucking 'the system'...  you are showing, by example, that which most politicians are
           afraid to even approach with empty rhetoric.



           Kindest Regards,




           Charles Justice
