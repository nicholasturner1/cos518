          I'll work up fresh new remarks for you, as I delivered the proc and revised remarks on
          your behalf.   The event sponsors gave me some adorable Harley baby things to pass on to
          you and Trig:)

           Kate- thanks so much for the bike blessing info also - I'll use it at next week's
          event... it sounds like it may be a bigger event even than yesterday's bike blessing.
