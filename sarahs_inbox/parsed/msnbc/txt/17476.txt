         Thanks so much John! What an amazing accomplishment of our Senator. I can have Kari
         format this from Juneau if that's the easiest way to go with the congratulatory letter.



         All is well. I'm in AZ for an educ symposium . And am praying for Agia to pass so we can
         get on with finding AK' s gasline partner.



         Good to hear from you.

        Subject: Senator Stevens/Congratulatory Letter



        In view of the attached article from Congressional Quarterly= , I thought that you might
        want to write a short congratulatory note ,= to Senator Stevens. So, I've drafted the
        following for your = consideration:



        Dear Senator Stevens,



        I read with interest the Congressional Quarterly article = about your longevity in the US
        Senate.  Congratulations on becoming = the longest-serving Republican Senator in the
        history of the Senate and on = your status as the seventh longest serving Senator ever.



        Your longevity is admirable on its own merits, but what you have done = with that tenure
        is even more impressive. Your mastery of a broad = spectrum of issues and your important
        leadership role in the Senate have = greatly benefitted the people of Alaska and the
        nation.  Alaska is a = much finer place because of your almost 13,990 days in the Senate.




        I look forward to continuing our work together in behalf of the = people of Alaska and to
                                                                 1




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01_0000984

         learning from your fine example of dedicated = public service.



         Sincerely,




         Governor, I hope you're doing well. We haven't talked = in a while, but I think things
         are going pretty well on the DC front.




         Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
