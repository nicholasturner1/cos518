         Governor - at this point, there are several big items that have not been

         addressed.     If we try to keep the FY2008 budget, given the new revenue

         estimate, under $4 billion, Muni Rev Sharing $48.1, Education Funding

         $111.0, PERS/TRS ??, capital $100.0, will likely come from remaining

         FY2007 surplus.      We will need to regroup on PERS/TRS with the

         legislative proposal to see what cash infusion, if any, is necessary in

         FY2008.    The change in the revenue picture makes it even more important

        to keeping the focus on $3.9 billion for FY2008 - but there are still

         some big budget pressures out there that we need to work on!                       Karen

        Rev Share - how it fits in with our proposed PERSTRS contribution. We'll be asked about
        it, no doubt, in tomorrow's press conf. We'll be asked if this 48 mil takes the place of a
        portion of the PERS contribution, or can we afford this IN ADDITION to PERS fix.
