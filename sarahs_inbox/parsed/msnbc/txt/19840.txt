              Unfortunately, its almost precisely the same debate that has been occurring for 30 years or more. To watch it
              now, you'd never know that almost the same arguments have been made for all that time. I wish I could say
              that the current debate would lead somewhere, but I doubt it despite the increasing decibel level from real
              people outside of the Capitol beltway.
