             Governor,




             Your mission is to meet and greet Home constituents for 1/2 hour after the bill signing,
             looking at these informational boards as you have time/initiative.



            Rep. Seaton's office is aware that you have to leave by 5:30 at the latest; Louie had
            promised me he would send me a list of those organizations who hope to have information
            available to you, should you stop by. I apologize for presenting so much information to
            you on your blackberry. I will reiterate your timeline with Louie.



             Kate

            What is my mission in this? Do I walk by and look at these displays - do they give
            presentations at each?
