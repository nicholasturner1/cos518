               Marty, Tom-

               Governor Palin will be introducing Steven Haagenson as the Energy Coordinator at noon today in
               the Juneau conference room . If you folks could make it up to the Anchorage conference room for a
               video conference - that would be great. The Governor would like you to convey the message of
               teamwork ! It is my understanding that the Point Thompson hearing will not be brought up.

               Thanks!
