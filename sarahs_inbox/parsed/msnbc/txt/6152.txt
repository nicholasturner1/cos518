        MESSAGE:

        Madam



         I am extremely impressed with what you are doing and thank you for being there for us.



        I am a retired Police Officer and while our attentions were focused on the recent amnesty
        bill in the U.S. Congress OSHA is trying to slip one in. If osha-2007-0032 is passed into
        regulation/law it would effectively by pass second ammendment and disarm every American.
        Please address this as soon as possible because it will elliminate you and I from being
        able to hunt. This would put thousands of businesses across the country out of business.



        Respectfully
