             It was a pleasure to travel with the First Gentleman. He lives up to the name. People
             were so thrilled he was there -- and so comfortable around him.



            Your energy proposals were also favorably received.              The community says it takes a huge
            load off everyone's shoulders.



            I think we both learned a lot -- and the Galena boarding school is definitely a community
            success story.



            The golden nugget we came away with was from Sidney:    common sense is an endangered
            species.   Todd seemed to get a kick out of that Sidney'ism too.



            Thanks for the opportunity to have this         experience.

            Rhonda: thanks for traveling to Galena! Todd is so excited to have seen some success
            stories out there and I'm very thankful you were there too. Thanks for your obvious
            dedication to rural, Rhonda, and for helping us think of things we can do to celebrate the
            successes and help with the challenges in rural.
