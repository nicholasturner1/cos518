              Too many people to ensure confidentiality. And, I know Andrew twists things but he quoted
              so someone talked. We have only one person I can see on our side who makes me wonder if
              it's him, but there are a whole host of others on the congressional side it could have
              come from.

              Water under the bridge now.

              Small meeting next time is the answer.
