               I'm tempted to add: "See, we told you BP would invest more in Alaska this year."




               On second thought, maybe not...




               Seriously, the negotiations were enlightening with regard to BP's current state of mind.
              At some point, I'd like to de-brief with you three.

                Thanks for letting us see this ahead of time. I don't know the background of all the
               numbers but the press release sends two messages : 1) this Administration is looking out
               for Alaskans and 2) we are willing to work with the companies. Both great messages
               leading into this week. Tom
