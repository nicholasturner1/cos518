          MESSAGE:

          Hello, Governor Palin!



          I just wanted to say that I appreciate you standing tough with the big oil companies. It
          is refreshing and encouraging to see a public official such as yourself not bowing to the
          big corporations.  Thank you for standing strong for political/professional ethics!



          As well, thank you for handling the "Hottest Governor in the US" publicity with
          professional grace.  Your professional people-savvy demeanor is a great example to others
          of dignity and self-respect.  Thank you for being a good role model for girls/women.



          I also support your stance in wanting to manage the surplus oil revenues wisely for the
          future.   I am all for money management decisions that will bless future generations of
          Alaskans -- we are blessed today, but we should be good stewards of these funds for our
          children.   Please push to invest/save as much as possible for future years.



          Thank you for all your hard work!!!



          Karen Biggs,

          Anchorage, AK
