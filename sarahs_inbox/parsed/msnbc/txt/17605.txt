              Preliminary recommendations for MTAB . There are a few things I'd like to share with you guys,
              but in the mean time here is the list I've put together. I've set a May 1 deadline for the board
              because the phone calls and emails have increased significantly. Although , it's not set in stone,
              it sounded safe.

              Thanks!
