                   In the Ear: "On a less satisfying note, can it possibly be true that Joe Ralston, the other
                   board member who lost his seat last week, learned he was out by reading it in the
                   newspaper? It seems unlikely, but earmites are saying the new regime is really bad at
                   communicating plans to those affected. "

                   oops... we need to be more careful in how these folks are informed. I thought Ralston
                   was called.

                   Lets make sure before any replacements that there' s no annoucement until we make
                   every effort to inform the affected party.

                   Also, did Greg Wilkenson really transfer to HESS? Who will be DPS spokesman?
