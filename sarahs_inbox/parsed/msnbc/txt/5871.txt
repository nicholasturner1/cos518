             Subject: Prayer Breakfast Photos

           Hello Governor,

           The Governor's Prayer Breakfast (Lunch this year) would like to run a TV. ad for the event. Would it be okay with
           you- to use your official picture? Andy Mills is sending a few other pictures over. The advertisement would
           basically show a few pictures and say something like.."Come join us as we honor, support, and pray for Governor
           Sarah Palin" followed by the information for the event.

           I apologize for bothering you with questions , we just don't want to over-step our bounds or use something that
           we shouldn't.

           Thanks!
           Erika
