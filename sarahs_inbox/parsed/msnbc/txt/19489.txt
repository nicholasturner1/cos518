               Frank and I are trying to recall if our letter of invite went out to him, or who specifically in all
               these months of me inviting critics to visit it. Maybe janice knows.

               He's not at this conference and he's already been there (is my understanding... don't quote me on
               that I'll have Joe or Tom or someone confirm), but yes we've sent out.the word that we want him,
               obama, everyone else to get up here and see the swath of land for themselves. I've spoken w him
               about ANWR but don't remember if in that conversation 5 months ago I repeated our open
               invitation for him and other elected officials to come up. Maybe I should put the invite in written
               form too?

              According to DOE there will NOT be amd there IS no export license! Correct me if I'm wrong,
              tom/marty... But that's what Slutz told me yesterday even. We need to get the word out on that
              one,,, also that today's Congress is also saying no license.

              Bizarre. Almost like sending a press release out multiple times huh??

              okay bad comparison.

              anyhoo...i'm checking on that line about the export license in this ad. didn't think that was accura

              at least they're getting the "columns" right finally.
