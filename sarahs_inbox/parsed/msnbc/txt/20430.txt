           Before ADN files its follow-up story that Kyle must be writing, could you make sure he's
           not mistaking on my answer to the question re: if I knew of the calls (see below)

    i


          In it, didn't Jason Moore (or another reporter) ask if I was aware of "any of these calls
          putting pressure on to fire Wooten"?

             And my response was "no, I wasn't aware (of any "pressuring Monegan-type" calls)".

             Is the media now reporting that incorrectly - claiming I'm inconsistent or unbelivable
          because I HAD to have known? I still don't believe there were ANY Monegan-pressured calls
          and the closest to that would have been Bailey's tape (but it wasn't to Monegan), or
          Todd's inquiry (but that wasn't "pressure" on Monegan- it was following Law's website
          instruction to bring trooper concerns and complaints to the DPS Commissioner, and
          following Security Detail's request that Todd bring forth his concerns to the Commissioner
          - it wasn't a "pressure" call).

             Also, Channel 11 hacked Bailey's phone call and it sure sounded like they edited the
          tape (without any acknowledgement of doing so), taking his comments further out of
          context. Pls listen to their 10pm report and I think they need to correct and clarify that
          they edited his comments, if I heard that right.

            The more I think about ADN's follow-up questions to me, and having heard Channel 11's
          report, the more I'm wondering if they're getting this wrong (and they need correcting)
          re: my answer to the specific question of whether I knew of any "pressuring Monegan"
          calls. I still don't believe there were any - and I totally disagree with Walt's assertion
          that Bailey and Krietzer and Todd and Tibbles specifically "pressured" him. And Talis'
          call wasn't pressure either.

              Governor, I've contacted the Armed Services YMCA, Army Community Service at Ft. Rich, DMVA (only
              via e-mail - no one answered any of their phones) and Pete Mulcahy, formerly of Armed Services YMCA
              - and he's going to blast e-mail it out to all of his many, many contacts in town.

              I am happy to staff you for this event unless you already have someone else in mind.
