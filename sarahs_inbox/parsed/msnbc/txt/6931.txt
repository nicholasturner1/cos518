            Just a comment:

            This PR ROCKS . I know these revelations are sick, but it is this type of attitude that our Governor was elected on
            and that the people of the state craving . No-bones common sense responses like this make me wanna stand up
            and cheer.

            It IS disgusting . To know now that these folks were working against the citizens of their own state for the benefit of
            some powerful companies is beyond unbelievable . We sensed it, but didn 't know for sure.

            THAT is the Sarah Palin I know!

                                            Governor Palin Responds to VECO Guilty Pleas

            May 7, 2007, Skagway, Alaska - While in Skagway, Governor Sarah Palin had the following to say
            regarding the guilty pleas from VECO executives in federal court this morning:

           "To have this truth now, to know that some Alaskans willingly and knowingly participated and
           encouraged this corrupt behavior is disgusting," said Governor Sarah Palin. "It is truly unacceptable
           and I will work tirelessly to make sure this does not happen on our watch."

                                                                                ###
