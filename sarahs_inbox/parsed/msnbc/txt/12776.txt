             Ok- thanks for the update. I've been wondering where it was. I'm double/triple checking on
             the Earmarks op-ed piece too... things seem to fall into thin air and I don't hear about
             them unless I'm bugging folks to find out. I emailed Sharon and Beth on the Earmarks piece
             just a bit ago.
