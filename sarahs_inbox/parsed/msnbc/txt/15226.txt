            Dear Ms. Perez,

            Please cancel my request for public records. We have a limited budget

            here and paying $ 1,250 in fees for people who already are on the

            state payroll is ridiculous , and frankly , a June 3 response is of

            little use to me.

            Thank you for your time ,     I'll find the information elsewhere.
