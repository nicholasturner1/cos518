            Not sure what happened - I waited til the last minute and no proclamation showed up... so
            to improvise the me found a poem, handed it to me, I took a chance and read it instead of
            the missing proclamation (which was noted on the printed agenda that the Gov's
            Proclamation would be read) - let's hope it didn't offend vets or military personnel who
            were there to be honored.

           Governor - just talked with McHugh and he will give Jerry a heads up that you will be at
           the 1:00 Wall to read Proclamation. Jerry has Proclamation and will be on the lookout for
           you.  Janice

             Did Frontiersman interview at start of Mem Day parade in Valley... I also let Laura know
            I'd be at Wall ceremony to read proclamation. I'll look for Jerry Beale or whomever has
            the proc at the 1pm ceremony.
