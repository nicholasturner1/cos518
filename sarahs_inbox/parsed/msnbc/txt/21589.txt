               Hmmm- not good. This is the reason I flew to Anchorage, missing more of the special
               session, and it's what I told reporters yest. I'll turn around from my trip into kulis and
               head for the Anchorage office instead.

              Governor - I just spoke with McHugh Pierre. The deployment that we had on your schedule
              for 10:00 a.m. today happened yesterday morning. There was no ceremony - it was just a
              handful that deployed for 45 days. Apparently it was continuation of group that went out
              Sunday evening (Lt. Gov) attended that one. Sorry for any inconvenience. Janice
