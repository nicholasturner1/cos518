               She did not extend an invitation, in any form, through this office (me, Mindy or Lauren).
               If she had, I certainly would have conveyed the message... after I recovered from passing
               out.



               To answer Frank ' s question , Lyda' s cell is      Privileged

              Not through me. She is unbelievable. Her cat must have forgot to pass it along.

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
