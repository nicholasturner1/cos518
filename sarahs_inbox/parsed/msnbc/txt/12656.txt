           Thank you! It's still pretty surreal... and we know we'll only be given what we can handle
           by our good Lord. Thanks!

          Todd and Sarah,



           Sharon and I are sooooo happy for you :) It really meant more than you know how special
          it was to hear ahead of time. I hope the baby takes after both of you. Alaska needs more
          people like you.
