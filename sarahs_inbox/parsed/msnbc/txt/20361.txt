           Hello,



           My name is Naomi Doty,I am 16 years old. I am not exactly shure if this is the right place
           to go for something like this, or if it is of any importance to the governor,but my family
           and i were looking into moving to Alaska, we currently live in Michigan, and i was
           wondering if there was some sort of grant that you get for living there. My family doesent
           have enough money at this current time to travel there and I was wondering how all of that
           would work so if you could please E-mail me at the E-mail address given that would be
           great.



           Thank you,




           Naomi Doty
