          Governor,

          Congratulations on achieving this glorious, historic milestone for all Alaskans. Keep

          Subject; Out of range



          I'm going camping and just found out that there is no cell service. I picked the nearby
          location assuming it would. I'll be back in range tomorrow afternoon, but will try and
          check periodically (down the road).



           Congratulations!!!
