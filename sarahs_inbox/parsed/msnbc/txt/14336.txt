            MESSAGE:

            Just want to say "Go Gov". Just read the article about you giving birth to Trig, knowing
            he had down's syndrome before he was born. I praise God for you being strong enough to
            take the public stand as a govenment official that you have. What a shame that human life
            has so little value to so many in this country. Shame on us as a nation, but God bless
            you, and may you keep on in His strength.



            Your friend and sister in Christ,

            Brenda Havard
