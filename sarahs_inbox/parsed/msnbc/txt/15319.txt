             Subject:                 Telephone Call - Mayor Begich - 05.16.08


             Governor -




             I just spoke by telephone with Mayor Mark Begich. Mayor Begich is asking for a quick
             phone call with you in regards to Capital Budget. I explained that due to the
             overwhelming requests that you are not meeting individually on the Capital Budget - it is
             just not possible.  The Mayor stated that he understood and here are his points.




             1.      He does not want to lobby you.

             2.      Does not want to go over shopping list with you.

             Wants to talk with you on the Wind Farm Project - he feels that you have limited contacts
             out there on this item. He is very concerned that he knows what your fee
