                                     Governor Palin Supports Corrections Commissioner

               April 22, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today expressed her full support for
               Department of Corrections Commissioner Joe Schmidt.

               "Commissioner Schmidt has my full support as he and his team continue to bring remarkable
               reforms to the Department of Corrections," Governor Palin said. "Joe has emphasized recruitment,
               hiring 34 new officers in FY 2007 and authorizing an additional 43 officers for FY 2008. Joe's
               strength is his respect for the hard work and talent of his department's employees. He
               understands the role the department plays in protecting the public while providing offenders with
               the opportunity to successfully return to society. Joe has my unconditional support."

               The Alaska Correctional Officers Association voted today in favor of a "no confidence" measure.
