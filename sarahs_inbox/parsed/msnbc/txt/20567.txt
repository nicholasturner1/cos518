           Dear Governor , The serious questions would probably recieve no comment . I understand you
           will be in Kenai tommorrow with a full schedule no doubt. If you have a spare moment let
           me know.



             The commercial fishery was closed and the in-river fisheries stayed open in spite of no
           minimum escapement. Management here is a case of conservation for the commercial fishery
           and opportunity for the in-river fisheries. This is wrong.



              Anyway good luck at the GOP convention. Please tell Senator McCain about the pain from
           the Exxon decision. If you stop in Seattle try the Wild Ginger Restaurant. My brother Don
           is the maitre'de.



           Safe Travels, John McCombs
