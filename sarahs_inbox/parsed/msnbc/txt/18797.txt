         I finally found a good replacement for mike chambers at dot. An energetic and sharp
         reporter who's ready to go on a new path.



          Making positive changes in dot, even in that spot, is part of the "let's get back in
         transition mode" that you promised me we'd get back in.



          It is time. Now. We are back in transition mode and you have promised to help me, Mike.

           dept's budget before they're submitted and I ' m forced to make the cuts , to all the exempt
           employees who are fighting change every step of the way - things MUST change and we need
           to see major , positive changes starting today.



            Thanks Mike - we can talk about this today as things can't be in this status quo
           situation a day longer or we will not be succeeding with a good agenda for Alaska . We need
           PEOPLE to be there with us , not fighting against us behind the scenes , and not setting
           themselves up for other opportunities a couple of years from now.



            Thank you!
