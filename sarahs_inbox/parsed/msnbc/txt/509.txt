Sarah , < br><br>l know you're probably hearing all kinds of things about Mat Maid and yesterday's
fiasco but here's my two cents .<br><br>Mat Maid started out as a creamery in 1936 making only
butter and selling eggs .& nbsp ; They eventually started selling excess milk from the creamery .&nbsp;
This was a profitable business for years .& nbsp ; As recently as 1980, Mat Maid 's milk was 100%
Alaskan dairy produced.&nbsp ; Now they say their milk is 35% Alaskan mixed with imported milk
from outside .&nbsp ; I've been told it's more like 10 % Alaskan .<br><br>A 1998 legislative audit (audit
digest # 10-4545-98 ) showed that the company was in dire straits then.&nbsp ; The public is under the
impression that Mat Maid's woes are recent .&nbsp ; Of course production /supply costs have
skyrocketed but I think the companies major problem stems from WAY too much diversification.
&nbsp ; They are producing too many different products (which are more expensive than the
competition ). &nbsp ; Alaskans' loyalty

 to the brand has kept them afloat for a long time but the whole thing is a losing proposition .< br><br>
There is a growing market for organic and premium dairy products .&nbsp ; Maybe by scaling down
their operations and specializing in high end , 100% Alaskan diary products ( no imported milk powder,
etc.), we could save the existing dairy farmers and the jobs of most plant workers .&nbsp ; I suggest
sticking with milk, butter , premium ice cream (people will buy it!), and maybe cheese .<br><br>Pass
this message along to Dept. Comm . Richard LeFebvre if you'd like as he seems to be up on the
current situation .< br><br>Good luck, <br>Chuck < br><p>&#32;
