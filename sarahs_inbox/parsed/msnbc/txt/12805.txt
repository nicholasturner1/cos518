            Subject:                 Lyda


            Harris just did a press conf where he repeated Lyda's disingenous comments from last week
            re: my "promise to NOT veto projects"... supposedly I traveled the state, visiting vetoed
            projects, and according to Lyda I "got educated and promised not to veto the projects if
            they got back in the (supplemental) budget". I totally disagree with Senate and House
            leaders repeating Lyda's claim.



           When we asked, Lyda listed Valley Recycling project visit and committment (yet I have not
           visited the center and did not know the gal Lyda said I promised); Mat-Su Miners baseball
           field (Kris was with me- I threw out the first pitch, did not "tour" anything and made no
           promises of no veto); and Lyda couldnt recall what other projects, but claims there must
           be many.



           Russ believed another project being touted as veto-proof, via my promise, came after
           touring the Anchorage port - again Kris was with me - no promise was made except to say I
           wanted to put it in a bond pkg so voters could confirm that project as a state priority.



           Can you think of anything else that she and Harris could be misconstruing as my "visits
           and promises to NOT veto"... I know she's wrong but we must now spend valuable time
           proving her wrong. Thanks.
