             when we bought the Jetta it cost $22 to fuel up. Now it's over $50.

             Ivy- who in state top brass could look into this?

            Boy, that would be great and would be huge. I was just telling my Dad how I paid $4.29/gal
            for diesel - $56 total. Ouch.

             Who would be in charge of eliminating gas tax at the pump for the summer driving season?

             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,

              First I wish to send my heartfelt congratulations on the birth of Trig.

             Your positive attitude touches anyone who loves the Lord and understands

              that He is in control of our lives. God bless you and your family.



             Another issue on my mind is a more down-to-earth issue. With the

             soaring gas prices, what are the chances of the legislature meeting

             under special session and exempting Alaskans from the state gas tax for

             the summer? Alaska is especially blessed with high revenue from oil.

             Why not get a little relief from the price at the pump? Please do what

             you can.    Thanks,    David W. O'Dell
