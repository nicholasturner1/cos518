         Subject:                  Matmaid


         Pls read Prof Oliver Hedgepath's ADN opinion piece today re; MM.



         It's in the Valley section.



        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                                - these are some of
         the good minds and great Alaskans who could provide the new energy and ideas we need in
         Ag. They could help with the $600 MatMaid plan. They should be the replacement board
         members for BAC and Creamery , and can help us out tremendously.



         I'm ready to go on the replacement idea - haven't contacted these folks yet re their
         willingness to serve (and there's at least one of them in that group that should be the
         new Director of Division of Ag), but I know them all, trust them, and would love to work
         with them. Mike - are we ready to go on replacements?



         I'll ask Ivy to be ready for the green light soon - but know that I haven't requested
         their service yet Ivy. Thanks!
