  Todd,
  I spoke with both the Office of International Trade and ASMI trying to determine whether foreign
  companies have an interest in coming to Alaska to process fish. Patricia from the Office of International
  Trade said she gets very few inquiries, mostly from companies that are small, not very organized, and
  don't have any significant capital or resources to invest. They are generally interested in buying finished
  products, not purchasing directly from fishermen and doing the primary processing. In general, her
  feeling was that companies that could really pull off such an operation already have existing contracts and
  connections with companies in Alaska. It was also noted that the interest that existed a few years ago
  when prices were so low doesn't exist now that shoreside processors are paying a bit more for salmon.
  I have our fisheries development specialist working on sorting out whether a foreign processor would
  have to comply with Alaska's labor and safety laws. He is also looking at some market and economic
  impacts of bringing in foreign processors. When I get something from him, I'll send it to you.
  Cora
