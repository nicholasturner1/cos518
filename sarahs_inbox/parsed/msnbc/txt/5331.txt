               This will certainly be our "problem" now. As I work on the Governor's

               talking points for tomorrow, could you please advise me of any

               specifics that were not released yesterday and that the media would be

               interested in - in terms of the AGIA rollout. We need the headlines to

               stay strong and not fade.



               Please note that the Commissioners do not need to stay late for Bill

               now; however, Sabra Ayers with the Anchorage Daily News may have a few

               questions after the briefing.



               Thanks,

               Meg
