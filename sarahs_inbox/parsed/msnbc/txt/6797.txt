          I am ALWAYS willing and proud to participate with and support the Governor. Just let me
          know how.  I will plan on attending.



          Some things to think about: Rotaries stick to a tight schedule, the most time we will
          probably get is 20 to 30 minutes, additional time for questions. The Barrow presentation
          will be at least double the time. I can give any length summary of AGIA.



          Although I am a member of the Fairbanks Downtown Rotary and the Rotaries know me well and
          like me,  they really like the Governor. We want to make sure the Governor

          gets good mic time. Bottom line they want to hear from the Governor. Tom

          I'd like to propose that the Governor' s address to the Fairbanks Rotary on

         Thursday be more of a joint address with the Governor and Commissioner

          Irwin. What I am thinking is almost a dry-run for Barrow - the Governor will

         address the audience for the first ten minutes regarding the importance of

         AGIA and then Commissioner Irwin would add to that. What do you think? Are

         you comfortable with that?




         Thanks,

         Meg
