         Thanks- you ' re awesome . Sometimes a medium forgets to yank an outdated psa from its
         rotation - kind of like our fish and game letters we sent this spring under the former
         Gov's signature ... it just takes awhile for transitions to be completed!

         Governor,



         Thanks for letting us know. I'm copying Sherry on this message so she can follow up on
         our end to prevent future problems with this PSA and any others that may be out there from
         the former administration.



         Karleen

        I just heard the fetal alcohol syd psa "from the office of the governor ..." starring frank
        and nancy m. It was kind of funny, but we'll probably take some heat for it being so
        outdated...
