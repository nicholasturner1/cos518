             Governor,

             I spent time some time today speaking with a few House Finance members on AGIA. I had individual
             meetings with Rep. Chenault, Rep. Meyer, and Rep . Mike Kelly.

               2. Rep. Meyer: Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



               3. Rep. Mike Kelly: Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I've got strategic thoughts I'd rather not type out here but perhaps we can speak soon.

            All the best,

            Sean
