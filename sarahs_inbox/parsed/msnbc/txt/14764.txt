           Congradulations on your little special angel. I have a 7 year old with Down Syndrome. This
           child will bring so much to your family. How happy and funny and wonderful he will be. My
           little pumpkin is so special. Nicolette even had a photo shoot with Pierce Brosnan for a
           Down syndrome celebration in Ireland. She made him and every one else just laugh and
           smile. If you have any questions please dont hesitate to call or you can also contact the
           Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles and speak with Gail Williamson. Remember you cant
           hug and kiss him too much. He will be such a love. You are so blessed. Those book are
           pretty scary and dont really-especially mothers. That kind of experience is priceless and
           very informative.  Have a Great Day



           Sincerely,



           Cynthia Morrison
