               Governor,

               Below are the contact phone numbers for the ETS employee widows. There is no expectation for you to call, so
               the option is completely yours. The numbers below are in case you do have time to make these condolence calls.

               Sandy Middleton:        Privile ed' Ed Middleton's sister-in-law and wife of victim Thomas Middleton of
               Anchorage)
               Terri Seward:            Privile a (wife of victim Michael Seward of Palmer)
               Tracey O'Donnell:        Privilege wife of victim Joseph O'Donnell of Girdwood)

               I didn't include pilot Benoit Pin's family as this should be handled through his employer, Era Helicopters. If you'd
               like that as well I can get that phone #.

               I've spoken with Annette and while there was some confusion over who was communicating directly with the
               families yesterday, today that has been resolved. All families have either been contacted or attempted to be
               contacted by the Department of Administration.

               Their single point of contact with the State is Carol Beecher, Assistant to Kreitzer, cell Privilead This has been
               communicated to the families. She is working all issues relating to insurance , benefits packets, likely
               counseling... etc.

               Frank
