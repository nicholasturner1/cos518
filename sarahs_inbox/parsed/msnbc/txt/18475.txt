            Hi Frank,

           Great question! We rely on others to get us information. I knew about Lynne's dad, but had not heard about
           Annette's. So, now that you have told me, I will be sure to get a condolence letter to her. Thanks for letting me
           know.

            Hi again Michelle,

           Do condolence letters get sent to State employees automatically from the Governor, such as Lynne Smith in the
           Governor's office and Commissioner Annette Kreitzer whose fathers recently passed away? How do you typically
           find out about a death in the family such as this?

           Thanks so much.
