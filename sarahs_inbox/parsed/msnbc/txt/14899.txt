           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,

           I just read a wonderful article today in the Sacramento Bee about the birth                of your son.
           CONGRATULATIONS!!! I found out this weekend that my son who is 3 months old                also has
           Down ' s syndrome so the article was so timely for me and my husband . We have             two older
           sons , Diego age 5 and Mateo age 3 . Joaquin was born on 2-2 - 08. I would love            to hear more
           about your journey with Trig.

          I wanted to share with you that my husband and I are applying to attend a wonderful week
          course/seminar in Philadelphia at The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential on
          "What To Do About Your Brain-Injured Child". We hope to attend the June session. It would
          be so wonderful if you were to attend as well. The website is www.iahp.org. My husband has
          a nephew with Down's and has participated in this amazing program since he was an infant
          and he is now 16 years old and thriving.

          Please let me know how I can get updates on how you and your son are doing. I wish you the
          best and hope to someday meet you.

          Take care and congratulations again on your beautiful baby boy!

          Jennifer Varanini Sanchez
