              FYI - this is the solution Talis and I worked on in response to lobbyists calling our attorneys at Dept of Law.

              Dear Mr. Sniffen , I am continuing to get questions about our contacts with Ashley Reed and whether it is
              appropriate at all. In this case in order to avoid further problems with the Neuman bill I would like you to take the
              following approach . Should Mr. Reed (or any lobbyist on the Neuman bill) call you again about this then you
              should politely indicate that if someone has questions or concerns they should call you directly, not via a lobbyist
              I will be working with Mr. Tillery to try to articulate a department wide policy on lobbyist contact rules. Thanks
              Talis
