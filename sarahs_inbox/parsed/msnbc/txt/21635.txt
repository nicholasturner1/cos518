             Eric Fry has the names of the schools. We have written a letter to the editor response to
             circulate to newspapers . The study was very flawed. Eric Fry and I called Mat Su and
             Fairbanks superintendents personally to talk about how flawed and unfair the report was.
             additionally, EED was misquoted .  This article was unfair to districts that are struggling
             to fix the dropout problem. Bat

             Lynne: pls get me the names of schools John Hopkins released (cruelly) re: "drop out
             factories"... what a slam. I've already spoken to one of the principals but want to write
             to each school to encourage them and offer something I think I can do personally to help
             encourage their kids to stay in school.



             The study cited seemed so bogus to be able to conclude these were drop out factories...
             I'd like to contact them and help.
