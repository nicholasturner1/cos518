             Governor, DOT&PF needs approval to proceed with a mitigation transaction for the Juneau Access project. The
             Department has asked Southeast Alaska Land Trust to obtain an in-holding in Point Bridget State Park that is for
             sale by a family that would like the land to be protected . The cost is approximately $500,000. While this
             purchase is to fulfill a mitigation commitment for JA, it can be used to mitigate impacts to marine waters from
             other projects (e.g. highways along a shore , ferry terminals, an airport in tidelands, eta) if the JA project is not
             constructed. This acquisition will be made with federal transportation funds that are already obligated and in-hand
             for this purpose. The acquisition fulfills a commitment made by FHWA and is supported by resource agencies as
             it will protect habitat, and will benefit the state parks system because the land will be transferred to the park
             system rather than be privately developed.

             This mitigation process is required by all the resource agencies on all projects through the permitting process. It
             is a little like the 1% art factor on new buildings.

             SEAL Trust must submit a bid by July 3 , the deadline set by BIA who holds the land in trust for the Native owner.
             The funds do not need to be transferred by then, but they need to know if the money will be available as soon as
             possible before July 3.
