                   Thank you, Secretary Leavitt, & welcome! I am happy to accept this award on
                   behalf of the State of AK. I want to welcome also Region 10 HHS Director James
                   Whitfield, & extend my heartfelt thanks to Comm. Hogan & Ann Potempa with the
                  Dpt. of Health & Social Services - thanks so much for your hard work promoting this
                  worthy program in our great state! Dr. Butler, thank you for being here, for working
                  to promote healthy lifestyles in AK, & for practicing what you preach! I am SO proud
                  of AKns for stepping up in such a big way during this Nat'l fitness challenge. The

                   2,800 AKns signing up & adding at least 30 minutes of running, biking, walking & dozens of
                   other activities to their day.

                   And we received strong support from inside the state system , too. The Dpt of Health &
                   Social Services challenged our other depts to participate , resulting in hundreds of our state
                   employees engaging in a little healthy competition (no pun intended)© - & with life-
                   changing results.

                   We are privileged to live in such a beautiful state, & AK offers endless opportunities to be
                   active, both indoors & out. Our people being our most precious commodity, it is
                   important that AKns not only live LONG in the land, but that they live WELL in the land.
                   Starting out adding just that little bit of activity to each day - just 30 min. - is so important to
                   our overall physical, mental & emotional health & wellness. And when combined with a
                   balanced diet, this can help lower the risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, &
                   numerous other health problems.

                   AK's 1st place finish shows that we are definitely moving in the right direction - in a
                   healthier direction - & that's GREAT news for the future of AK! My thanks again to Sec.
                   Leavitt for the presentation of this award; please give the President our best & thank him for
                   promoting healthy lifestyles in America ; & again , congratulations to all the AKns who
                   participated in the program! Your longevity & healthy lifestyle truly is the best reward.
                   Thank you!

              Governor and Marty,

              Attached is the op-ed piece which Kurt and I drafted and will submit to EnergyBiz tomorrow morning
              unless we hear back differently from either one of you.

              EnergyBiz specifically asked for an op-ed from the Governor discussing the "$500 million subsidy" and
              how much Alaska can help the nation in terms of amount , and what impact that would have on the Lower
              48.

              Thanks so much,
              Meghan
