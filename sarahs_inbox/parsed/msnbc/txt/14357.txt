          Governor - Mayor Whitaker, FBKS - has been asking for a meeting           with you in regards to the
          gasline.  We had thought that you would take a trip up his way            soon. We just received
          another call from the Mayor's office saying that the Mayor will            be in Anchorage on
          business on Tuesday, 04.29.08 and would like to see you. He is            coming by himself.




          On your calendar for Tuesday, 04.29.08 we have blocked 9:15 - 10:15 a.m. for appointment.
          11:30 - 12:30 p.m. for the Rev. Dr. Greene meeting. Would there be an appropriate time
          that Mayor Whitaker could see you for approx . 15 minutes during this day.
