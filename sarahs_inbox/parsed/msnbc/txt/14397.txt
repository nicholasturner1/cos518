             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,

             Let me congratulate you on the birth of your new son . Thank you so much for being an
             advocate for life. Your story is one that is an example to others, you stand in your
             beliefs, and you practice them also. May God continue to bless your family and you as you
             continue to govern the state of Alaska.

             My husband and I toured Alaska a few years ago, and only heard good things about Alaska's
             "woman" governor.   Now that I have read more on you, I can see why your people were
             boasting about you.

             You and your family will be put on my prayer list, and I will continue to pray for you as
             you raise your family and continue with your work.

             Again, thank you for your firm stand on life.

             Sincerely,

             Carol L. Brix
