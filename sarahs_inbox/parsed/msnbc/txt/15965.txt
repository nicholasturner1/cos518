          He stopped me to ask if I was "surprised" at seeing the overland numbers being so much
          more economic than my previously held belief (in the campaign, he reminded me) that LNG
          was king. I said Alaskans didn't have all the info back the, he pressed to ask if I was
          "surprised". I said I was.

          Didn't have time to explain it's not so much a surprise today - that's not the point- the
          point is now we HAVE the info and it's extremely valuable to finally have after decades of
          not.

               If anyone gets a chance to corner him and elaborate, please do.
