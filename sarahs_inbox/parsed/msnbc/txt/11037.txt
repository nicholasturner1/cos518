              Amazing. And Neanderthal. Does he believe Sen Stevens is wrong, then, in warning us not to
              be so reliant? If you have a second to jot a response, please do so iwe have it in my
              back pocket. This could be a good venue to prove my support/agreement with Sen Stevens'
              and Rep Young' s message and mission to get us off the Fed dole to a greater degree - we
              have no choice, it's going to happen- and I don't want Alaskans worried or dreading that
              day. We're being proactive.



              Yes, a response would be great.
