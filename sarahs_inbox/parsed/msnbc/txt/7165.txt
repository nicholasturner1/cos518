         Ok. So John B, would you update Karleen on Harris' conversation and if she's good to go
         with it - let's agree asap w/his "call" for sp session to deal with this - if in fact
         that's his intention. Thanks

         Thanks , Governor .      One thing to keep in mind is that our emergency regs

         will only allow is to make payments for 120 days.

        Subject : Sp session



        Interviewed by Donaldson just now      ( pis add to schedule ,    Kari )   and told him

        again " yes" on ppt special session once we get logistics wkd out , but not

        intending sp session on Sr Care unless /until Rep Harris talks to us about

        what they want to do to fix the problem they created by not funding our

        request in budget for this nor Longevity Bonus . In meantime we'll keep

        finding the money for Sr Care continuation , plus be clear about asking for

        supplemental next yr to cover costs be we WILL keep funding it somehow even

        if we dont have sp session on it.
