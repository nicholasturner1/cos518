             Sharon/Beth - this is the kind of info that needs to be shared with reporters before we
             get blasted, this info can now be used to at least clarify. (In addition to my earlier
             email explaining Williams has hung up on our schedulers, is offended I couldn't
             immediately take him up on his offer to have dinner with him at his house, etc)

             Governor:



             I can clarify the situation with mayor Joe Williams from Ketchikan.



             1.    Mayor Williams was offered a meeting with the Governor in Juneau a

             few days to a week after the announcement on the bridge. He refused.



             2.    I spoke with Mayor Williams about a month ago about his request for

             the Governor to come to Ketchikan. He said any trip by the Governor

             should occur under his terms which were
                                                                       1




                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0010523

             a)   the Governor fly to Ketchikan in the morning and meet with local

             officials.     He said he would need at least 7 days notice and I think he

             wanted to schedule the meeting with local leaders as an official joint

             Borough Assembly and City Council meeting.       The only topic would be

             Graving and AMHS issues.



             b)   After that the Governor stay in town throughout the day and attend a

             public meeting that evening.      The only topic would be Gravina.



             c)   Mayor Williams demanded that Commissioner Von Scheben and Deputy

             Commissioner Hardy accompany the Governor because he was upset with some

             actions by AMHS and wanted to address those in front of the Governor and

             the Assembly and Council at the early meeting.



             3.   I have been working with the lobbyist for the Borough for 2-3 weeks

             to try and meet with Mayor Williams to talk about a trip for the

             Governor that would be shorter in time (maybe 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours) at a

             different location than City Hall, and would include a broader agenda

             with positive points such as funding for Swan Lake - Tyee intertie,

             school funding, PERS / TRS funding, Capital budget appropriation for

             Schoenbar middle school, etc.



             I had a meeting scheduled for yesterday at noon to discuss this but

             Mayor Williams cancelled at the last minute.



             I also do not think he has even requested a meeting with the Governor in

             Juneau, although he has been here in Juneau for over a week.



             I will keep working with the Borough Lobbyist and Mayor Williams on a

             reasonable alternative for a visit to Ketchikan.



             Randy

              Lt. Governor: if at all possible, if we're missing any appts that are

              being requested by local officials, can we tap into your office for

              assistance? There are only so many hrs in the day, we're not refusing

              anyone an opportunity to meet with me and/or third floor officials, but

              evidently some AML members don't think we're trying hard enough. I am

              canceling more internal mtgs with staff to meet with others, but

              still... there are only so many slots in one day. Thanks

              It's a scorcher. Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I

             won't/didn' t spend time w/ the Mayors... sheeeesh...



              Sharon's comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our

             office . That ' s our committment.



              I don't want this issue to grow legs ,     so whatever we have to do to make

              sure we ' re.not double - booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that

                                                                 4

              they're being ignored - we'll do it.



              Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I

              have not done that and it ' d be refreshing if reporters asked for facts

              to back up complaints like that... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug

              local officials into the schedule as best we can - even if that means

              cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches. Thanks
