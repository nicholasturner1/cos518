MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your son! I work as the Activities Director at the Ketchikan Pioneers'
Home and when you travel to Ketchikan please feel free to call if you need a baby sitter while in
town. I can be flexible with my schedule and the elders would adore spending time with your son. I
have worked for many years as a social worker and raised 3 daughters here in Ketchikan. I am
serious about the offer. It was just placed on my heart to tell you so as I try to imagine the juggling act
that you are about to undertake with your many responsibilities. Take good care of yourself. Those
gas and oil guys can just be patient a little longer as you get to greet this new little guy. Stay true to
yourself.. .you are doing a fine job.
