              Subject :               MatMaid


              Lyda just told me she's called for an extensive audit of MatMaid be she said she's
              received a lot of information concerning improprieties and "problems at MatMaid",
              including "conflicts of interest with people serving". I told her "no kidding there's been
              problems, that's why we have a dedicated team of volunteers trying to get information on
              what went wrong and then how to right MatMaid". I also asked her if she's seeking to get
              information on problems we inherited, or did she feel we caused MatMaid's problems? She
              said,  "it's both".



              What's frustrating is Kristan and Kris and others have begged for assistance to get our
              own audit of MatMaid, they've basically had to do it themselves, and now it sounds like a
              legislator who doesn't necessarily want to see us succeed is moving forward on her own
              intense audit. We've had push back on our own request, which is understandably quite
              frustrating for BAC members who've cared sincerely about MatMaid and have wanted and
              needed information on MatMaid operations since Day One. I asked Lyda why don't we work on
              this together, if truly now she wants to help on MatMaid, but her goals are evidently not
              our goals - as we 're not blaming this admin nor this BAC for the problems at MatMaid.



              So, head's up.



              And I still want Kristan's request to be granted re: an audit if that's what Kristan
              needs.
