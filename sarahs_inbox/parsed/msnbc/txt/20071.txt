                Subject: President Bush/Fairbanks stopover

              I have just heard from the White House . The President will stop to refuel at Elelson AFB on August 4th between
              3:30 and 4:30, local time.

              The Governor is invited to greet the President at Eielson . Todd and Track are invited as well . The White House
              recognizes that Track may have military obligations that will prelude his involvement However, in the
              inimitable way of the White House, they now want to know as soon as possible whether Todd and/or Track will
              attend.

              The White House will identify a point of contact to fadlitate the arrangements, but this has not yet occu
              They promised to get back to us as soon as possible with this information.

              In addition to meeting with the Governor, the President will interact with military personnel . I don't yet know in
              what context this will occur.

              The White House has Janice 's name, and I told them to feel free to contact her directly as circumstances
              warrant. Janice, could you provide your cell phone number for weekend contact by the White House?

              p.s. Our principal contact at the White House is Elizabeth Dial. Her office number is 202 -456-2896, and her cell
              is Privileged o
