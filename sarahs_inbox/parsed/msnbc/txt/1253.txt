MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin,



Congratulations on the birth of your baby boy! I have a little boy named Max who will be celebrating
his 7th birthday this week. He also has Down syndrome.



Max is fully included in his kindergarten class and loves to swim . He is a shining light in my day and I
thank God every day for blessing my life with such a special child. Enjoy every moment , as you know
- children grow up so fast!



Best Wishes,

Krista Dean
