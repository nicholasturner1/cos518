                Hello Governor,

                Would you like steaks or chicken grilled (or something ordered) for dinner tonight?

                "And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right, for in due time and at the
                appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint." Galatians 6:9

                Thanks for working so hard for the good of our state!!!
