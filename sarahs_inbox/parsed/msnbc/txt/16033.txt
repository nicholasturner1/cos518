          MESSAGE:

          I am a female republican, and would really love to see you as McCain's running mate. I
          hope you will be seriously considered, and if asked to join the ticket, I hope you do. I
          would love to see someone who reflects my values and concerns in office. Good Luck!



          Sincerely,



          Danielle Fuller
