                 I talked to Paulette for ideas . She has offered private tours of DIPAK (the fish hatchery ) and the State Museum.
                 That should be fun for them.

                 and remember Rep. Stoltze is very gracious and friendly... maybe he could be one to introduce them?
                 he's the nice guy.
