              It's the headline because it's the easiest thing to capture and for

              the public to understand within the news today - and it was one of the

              new elements revealed to the media. In our next Compass, I also point

              out that the minimal contribution was $13b for the old proposal that

              didn't guarantee a permit much less a line.
