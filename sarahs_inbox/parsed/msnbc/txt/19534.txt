           Fyi for message incorporation... projects like access roads and building up infrastructure
           for future economic growth are also on our agenda - I'm afraid Alaskans are believing
           we're "all AGIA all the time", at the exclusion of other needs. So, when we get
           opportunities to proactively incorporate into our speeches, pressers, etc our other
           focuses, we need to do so (like building up our infrastructure with a good idea like an
           access road to our minerals I see below):

            (And note, there's been no major road built since the 70's... we're in the time of surplus
           where we can build up our infrastructure to create jobs, create access to rich resources
           in areas people want roads to resources so we can diversify our economy)

          I've asked Randy to look into the preliminary work that's been done on a road to connect
          Alaskans with their resources in the rich area of Nome. No major access road has been
          built in Alaska since the 70's, we're in a time of surplus where we should be building up
          infrastructure in areas people want roads and access for development, and we need to build
          access to further diversify our resource development base... so heads up that Randy will
          be contacting you who are needed to provide him info on this as we think big and
          proactively work towards enabling development for AK's future. Thanks!
