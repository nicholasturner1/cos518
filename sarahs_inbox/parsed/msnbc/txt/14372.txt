             Governor - in double checking with DMVA the welcoming home of the 180 is May 1. It was at
             first April 30 but had to be pushed back. May 1 is the correct date. Janice

              When we do the Welcome Home for the Guard next week we can announce hunting/fishing lic
             fee break for soldiers. Will the bill be ready to sign- or other bills by that time?
             Janice- pls make sure we have correct info on date on that- news reports still give two
                                                                     1
