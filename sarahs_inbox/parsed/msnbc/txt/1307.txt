Yes! This is awesome, great, wonderful news . Thank you! We don't want to lose you as Commish,
but it's nice that the "light at the end of the tunnel " got closer and clearer for you today. Thank you!

Dear Governor,



As you already know, we have a new commissioner of education! It took awhile, but we're finally
there! Mike and Lynne helped guide me through this process - they gave me good advice and it
made a huge difference. I regret that this process took longer than expected, so thank you for
hanging in there - it was worth it.



Take care, BAT
