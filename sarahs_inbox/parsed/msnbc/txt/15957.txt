          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin, congratulations to you and your family on the birth of your new addition.
          As the husband of a special education teacher, I know what a blessing you have allowed to
          come into the world.  As an aside and far less important, you have folks across the
          nation, even down here in Texas, who have paid attention to your leadership and want you
          for VP!!  God's richest blessings to you and your family - Jack O'Brien, Cypress
          (Houston), Texas
