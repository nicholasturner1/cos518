        One year ago (4 days from today, lyr ago) we were hearing about the raids on LIO offices.
        I remember Fagan announcing them from the fair and Lyda being in our office shortly after
        the telling you that Ben was a "brilliant man and a great leader."



        Days after the 8/22 Primary Victory and floods of national media inquiring how you
        unseated an established incumbent , you were in the process of expanding the grass roots of
        the campaign to include more expertise. Tony hit the airwaves immediately after 8/22.



        We were navigating the waters of newfound friends and those who genuinely and openly said
        they did not support us, but wanted to come onboard and help you become our next Governor.



        Frank

          Please put Bill McAllister somewhere on the schedule - he wants an

          interview on the one year anniversary of the corruption investigations.

         We're working on it. The only things that I know of thus far are the

         racing pigs at 4pm and the Carhartt Relay Race at 6:30 p.m. (which would

         be a good one).
