             Subject:                 Press with Steve


             With Steve Haagenson - tomorrow while I'm in the Anchorage office in the afternoon- plan
             is to speak with any interested media re: in-state use of our energy sources. Marty will
             be contacting Bruce on this, I wanted to let Sharon know also just fyi, as Marty will also
             be touching base with her on it.



             We need a better, clearer, more confident response to where we're going on answering the
             public and legislature's call for committment to addressing energy needs and in-state
             natural gas use.



             We can accomplish this tomorrow by allowing Steve (and I'll be with him) to speak to the
             issue: We need to assure Alaskans that AGIA facilitates, enables, encourages, etc in-state
             use of gas... and Steve can elaborate on that plus other potential energy sources.



             I'm spending the day in Anchorage tomorrow before returning to Juneau tomorrow night.
