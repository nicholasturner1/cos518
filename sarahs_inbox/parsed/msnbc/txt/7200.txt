             Tim Navarre/Mayor Williams Kenai Peninsula Borough--want to meet with the Governor June 13 in
             Soldotna during AK Global Award event. I told Navarre that if she flies in to the event, and flies out, we
             probably won't be able to schedule "meetings." He is somewhat distressed about LNG reauthorization
             and North Kenai Spur road extension and said they need to have a meeting within the next two weeks. I
             told him I was not at liberty to just schedule something like this, but could he please supply a briefing
             paper about their concerns? In the meantime, how should I deal with this request and who should talk to
             them? Thanks! Kari.

             He may have wore a back brace but I have never seen him with a flak jacket.

             Korhring wore a flak jacket on the House floor??? Hmmmm. Never can recall seeing pictures of him in such a
             contraption - not that I doubt what he says in his ADN interview... But in all the yrs you guys were there, did you
             ever notice it?
