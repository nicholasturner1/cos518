Hi Todd,



You and Rhonda are booked from Anc. to Galena. The return flight Saturday, is a chartered service;
Jim Smith will not bill us for that portion as it's also being used for the students. Jim said that they
would provide lodging in the dorms and meals in the dining hall, as well as picking you both up at the
airport and providing transportation during your stay. TA purpose: Attend Galena Interior Learning
Academy graduation ceremony May 16 at 7:00pm. and tour the facility



Please let me know if you have any questions, or if any of your information for this trip differs from
mine.

Thanks,

Erika
