          Thank you. What should I tell the farmers and employees at MM? Esp the farmers who will be
          ready to dump their milk in our parking lots if they don't get the word soon that they can
          still deliver milk after that June 26 date they were given? I'll be speaking with them and
          the public upon my return tonight. I'm headed to MatMaid tomorrow at noon. Remember
          they're counting on the $600g we fought for to help through this period of transistion -
          we're not going to break our word and pull the rug out from under them and spend the funds
          where then? Thanks

         Governor, a lot of work is being done on evaluating Mat Maid. Dick has been able to
         obtain reasonably reliable cost numbers and has given them in a report to Mike and Joe.
         This should give us a good business sense of Mat Maid. Although a lot is going on
         including the AGIA meetings in DC, please be assured that we have the same concern for
         finding a good way forward for the Dairy farmers as you. We will keep working hard with
         you on this. Tom
