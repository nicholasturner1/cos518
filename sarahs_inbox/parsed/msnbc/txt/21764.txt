             Are all the lawmakers back in Juneau now, anticipating floor action? or when do they
             trickle back in?

             The house has the bill on the floor schedule tonight. However, that will be subject to
             the pace of the finance committee work this afternoon. Its possible the committee will
             drag on into the night.



              In either case , any floor action tonight will be procedural only. it is most likely that
             any amendments or votes would take place Sunday.

              I'm hearing the bill may actually get to the floor tonight? Should I try to get back
             there asap?
