           Governor,



           I wanted to get these remarks to you as soon as possible, so that you could let me know if
           you'd like changes made. I can print these off onto two smaller cards that would fit in
           your Bible, if that suited you. Please let me know at your convenience if the remarks
           meet your expectations. Thanks so much and have a good day!
