             It was disappointing to read in Sen Stedman's local paper that he reported on AGIA: "... it was
             intentionally written to exclude or make it difficult for major oil compoanies to submit a pipeline
             proposal." If he was misquoted, I'd hope his newspaper would correct it - if not, he's still being a
             stinker about this.

             JB - would you check on this with him today? Let him know it was a great disappointment to
             read his quote.
