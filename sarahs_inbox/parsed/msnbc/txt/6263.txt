        Governor,




        I apologize for the confusion. The articles were written by Tim Bradner who took my
        statement that we had not found a fundamental flaw with PPT (something different than what
        was expected), and spun it as a tacit endorsement. Tim has a viewpoint that comes through
        in his reporting.  Throughout our interview, I never implied that PPT was good; in fact, I
        told him that I thought we could do better to target the credits toward the riskier
        exploration side, not give them across the board as PPT does. Tim chose to downplay those
        statements.




        Until we complete our review, make a recommendation to you, and you announce your
        intentions regarding a special session , I'm trying to keep the press message as a fair
        assessment of the options.



        I'm also looking forward to our next meeting on PPT. I expect it will be early next week.
        I still believe we will come up with a better option on the gross, but the politics are
        explosive, so we need to have all our ducks in a row before we launch anything. Tibbles
        and Joe will have thoughts on that issue.



        Again, I'm sorry the article created confusion. I agree with you that the                        sooner we come
        together on our plan, and get a positive message out , the better.



        -Pat

       Pat- we'll hopefully be meeting on ppt soon. The articles in yesterday's ADN and J of C
       sounded like a one-eighty departure from the consistent message re : ppt NOT being "sound".
       I was asked to respond yesterday by a few reporters in Juneau, and also by legislators who
       may now think we're confused... as they still expect the sp session call this fall and
       were surprised to read your comments. My response was that I haven't changed my mind about
                                                                  1
