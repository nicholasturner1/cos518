              Here is your reminder....a little early. I'll send one in a couple of hours as well to
              make sure you get this.



              KBYR's number is 274.5297 and just in case something went wrong, Eddie's cell is              Privileged
              He said just a quick note wishing him well would absolutely make his day.



              Thanks!

             Got a note from him asking if any way you could call in tomorrow. Told him tomorrow would
             be difficult to keep the expectation low.



              He has Coghill on at 430 talking Supreme Ct but said he ' d love to have u on whenever you
             could.
