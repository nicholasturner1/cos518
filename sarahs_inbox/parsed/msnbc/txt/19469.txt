           I just received a call from Karen Essary. Karen verified that your private email address
           is still hidden , so it's likely that they got the address via a cc or forward of an email
           with your address on it.



           We can have Karen set up a filter on your account so emails from that address are sent
           directly to spam .  Or we can set up a new email address for you and have this one
           forwarded to CR.   Janice
