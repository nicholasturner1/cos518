            MESSAGE:

            We need more persons like you in running our great nation. I pray that you will become
            the VP candidate for the Republican Party and thus will be able to affect what is going on
            in Washington, assuming that the party is able to win the elections. What a breath of
            fresh air that would be!!! You are indeed an inspiration.




            Please do not block this email, because I happen to be from Alabama, and not from Alaska.
            I hope to be one of your biggest supporters if you get the VP nomination, although am
            already a big supporter in mind, because of your history, and your actions.




            God bless you and this great nation.
