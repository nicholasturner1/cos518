             Before I got to your 2nd paragraph ,            I thought what a great opportunity for our 50th:



              Rhonda ,    I look forward to talking more about this tomorrow.

              Rhonda - Talis and I heard Vic Fischer and Byron Mallott speak at Tom Stewart ' s memorial
             service yesterday . We both caught something significant that was addressed , and Tom
             Stewart may have wanted accomplished ( we sure want it accomplished ): there's no mention of
             Alaska ' s first people in our Constitution ' s preamble , nor is there Native symbolism shown
                                                                        1

            on our State Seal.



             We'd like to do something about that , and since it's our 50th , this is a perfect time to
            add either the illustration or articulation of respect for Ak Natives .   Let's be thinking
            about what we can do there ! And have a good Sunday- thanks for being part of Friday's
            press event.
