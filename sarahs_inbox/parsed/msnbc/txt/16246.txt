           Thanks Debbie- I'm cc-ing in others be I need to hear if they've heared from our friendly
           legislators on this yet! I will work very hard to get BOTH these bills plugged in... it's
           just been a matter of timing w/sp session(s).

           Kelly, et al: what have you heard? I need to announce intentions soon on this issue.
           Debbie wants to continue working with us to see success here, I want to get these bills on
           the floor for a vote.

           Hi

           I called Lyda Green to ask her if she is still committed to help getting those two bills
           to pass and she said she is. She also said that she hoped it wouldn't be done in a third
           or fourth special session as it will be harder to get people there. I agreed with her. I
           have to say that I think the pro-life bills are a good fit with the energy crisis issue,
           all family related: Energy relief for families, protection of parental rights and
           protection of our smallest citizens through the PBA ban. I see Alaska Family Council is
           still pushing their parental rights petition and I know you don't need convincing about
           these issues. I also don't like that they are narrowing the discussion to only one of
           these important bills. They both will garner the same votes and we need to seize the
           moment on both. If we drop the PBA ban, we will have to bring it up again later. Aaaagh!

                                                               1

           My question to you is, "What can I tell people on my list?" Would you mind giving me
           something I can quote? It would help tremendously. I keep telling them I am in contact
           with your office and key legislators. Is there something more specific I can say or do I
           stick with that?

           Respectfully,



           Debbie   Joslin

               Stat Alert -June 20, 2008
               A recently released issue brief from the Project on Student Debt has concluded that over one
               million students are enrolled at community colleges that do not participate in the federal student
               loan programs. Moreover, historically underrepresented minority students are more likely to be
               among those students without access to federal loans . The brief, Denied: Community College
               Students Lack Access to Affordable Loans, is available at
               ( http://proiectonstudentdebt.or filesfpub/denied.pdf).
