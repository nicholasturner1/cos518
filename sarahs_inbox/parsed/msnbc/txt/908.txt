  I am writing you this e-mail in the hope that you would be willing to support your
  Alaska State Troopers by writing a letter to the editor of Anchorage Daily News before
  March 1, 2008. I can share numerous facts with you that emphasized the shortcomings
  in terms of recruitment, retention and compensation that would surely surprise you. We
  want members of the public to weigh in only if they feel compelled to community their
  feelings to the Governor through the ADN forum. Below is a sample letter that I wrote
  and submitted. If you are interested in supporting the Troopers by submitting a letter or
  know of somebody who would be interested please pass this information on to them and
 ask #h1 t^ zss^1 Inen _yQUlum the-Taelind^ to ^arriaud-,.
  opinion of 225 words or less.


  GOVERNOR FAILING TO SUPPORT TROOPERS
  Governor Palin is failing the Alaska State Troopers. Her stated focus and support for
  public safety is nothing more than empty rhetoric. For the past 15 years, Trooper wages
  have not kept up with the pace of inflation and increased competition from other Alaska
  and the Lower 48 police agencies for the same applicants has exploded nationwide. AST
  is losing new hires on a regular basis to other Alaska police agencies. Common sense
  says that increased competition and respectable compensation packages leaves AST in
  the dust. It's an embarrassment when AST is ranked a distant 5th in compensation
  among Alaska's finest and two decades behind in technology. This is State commitment
  for you! Why does a Trooper have to work 25% more to earn the same as their Alaska
  counterparts? Why is it that AST loses members regularly to other Alaska police
  agencies? How can the Governor say she supports the Troopers when the State forces a
  Trooper to move geographically with five years of employment, gives that Trooper a
  3.75% pay increase, then fails to recognize the cost of living in their new community is
  actually 40% higher. This is nothing new. Loyal Troopers are going broke and some
  families are forced to separate. That's a -36.5% pay decrease Governor! The Governor
  is out of touch with her Troopers and it shows!
