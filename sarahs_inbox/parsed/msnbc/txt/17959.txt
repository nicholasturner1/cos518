         Governor,   Joe and I have both individually visited with Russ Kelly. I thought I had a
         good discussion with him, just couldn't give Russ an immediate solution. I will offer to
         visit in person if you want me to.



         If your schedule allows I would like to add a discussion about Mitkof Homeowners to the
         conference call for Monday afternoon when we review Ag.   Hope you have a good weekend!
         God bless Tom

         Tha Mitkof Homeowners had the most contentious issue during my visit here, of course.
         Basically feeling that their voice is not heard. I told them if it helps to have a
         Commissioner here for a quick mtg, i'll send someone to meet. So - thats what we need to
         do.
