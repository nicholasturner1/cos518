Hello,

I agree with you. I think with it being Cort Saviers and Chris Jacobson it would be fine , since they
both come from good families and I don't have a problem keeping them in line . :) Chris' mom wanted
to make sure it was okay with you before she'd let them come over. What do you think if I have them
check in with me when they come over and just let them know that I need to be here for them to use
the trampoline?

Thanks,

Erika

Hi Erika,



I spoke with Sarah and she said it was OK for Willows friends to jump on the trampoline.But in my
opinion if they are getting out of control and or if one of them get hurt on state ground,this could be a
problem.
