        Governor - I just received a phone call from Frank Bailey and he had a call from Duane
        Bannock with Division of Motor Vehicles. The Division of Motor Vehicles is having a
        system program training seminar for approximately 80 employees tomorrow, Wed., 10.03 at
        the Marriott Hotel. This is an all day seminar. Mr. Bannock was wondering if the
        Governor would be available to stop by for a quick "thank you for all your work" to the
        employees.   I will call Mr. Bannock directly if this is something that we think can fit in
        for tomorrow.   Thank you, Janice
