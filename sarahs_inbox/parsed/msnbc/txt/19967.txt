          MESSAGE:

          Honorable Governor Sarah Palin,




         I am writing tonight to say that this scandal for the last two weeks has really angered
         me.  Not so much your department as the feeding frenzy of the news media. It has become
         national and I am so sorry for Alaska. Why does the legislature think they need an
        .investigation when they KNOW that Department heads serve at the pleasure of the governor?
         What more is there to say? NOTHING REALLY.




         I am hoping your husband will stay out of the roll of anything to do with your office. I
         realize he can advise you but he was not elected to anything so I assume he does not need
         to talk to any of your employees, and I'm not sure he even did, this could all been
         avoided if his name had not surfaced.




                                                               1




                                                                                                            PRA GSPOI_0022055

           You have brought ethics and honesty to our state and I sincerely hope this type of scandal
           never surface again




           Sincerely,



           An Alaskan of 66 years
