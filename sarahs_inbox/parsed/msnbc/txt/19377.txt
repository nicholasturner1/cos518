             I know that Janice is working with Arctic Power on the Republican Challengers trip, and I'll leave that part to
             her.

             We just met with Conoco and BP on other matters. They haven't been consulted on Speaker Pelosi 's energy
             legislation either but are quite skeptical that it will add much that is beneficial . I think we' re in the middle of a
             war of press releases designed to appeal to the minds and hearts of Americans before the August Congressional
             recess.

                Russ Kelly and I have made several calls to Capitol Hill, including = to the offices of Speaker Pelosi and
                Minority Leader Boehner. The = Democrat's energy legislation Is not yet available . It may be = tomorrow
                or early next week. The bill itself will probably not be = introduced until Wednesday.

                 So, my earlier critique will have to suffice for the moment. = Mr. Boehner's staff analyzes the announced
                 components pretty much as I = have a public relations exercise but not much substance.

                 Mr. Boehner is leading a small entourage of House Republicans to ANWR = in the same timeframe as the
                 so-called Republican Challengers trip. = Arctic Power is concerned about possible overlap , not something
                 any of us = can control.

                 Mr. Boehner has not discussed the trip publicly, but I'm trying to = get more information from his staff. I
                 think it would be good if we = can get you and him together, assuming your schedule permits. =
