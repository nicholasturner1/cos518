          Thanks - I've met with this group on this issue at least once already, then with Mulva and
          Bowles on it - seems the issue has been rehashed many times and still no progress - I need
          to hear the latest from Marty on it.

          Kris has also been a part of meeting (s) with this crew on the same issue.

         Subject: LNG export and Borough




         Just got done with a meeting with Mayor John Williams, Tim Navarre, Bruce Richards. (The
         Mayor had departed before they hit me with the LNG issue.) Because of the intensity of the
         concerns over the state position and because they think can provide a legit government to
         government alternative, I'm going to recommend you see if there are 15 minutes you can
         spare while you're here in Kenai for industry appreciation days. Listening to them will go
         a long ways to calming down the concerns. (They felt blindsided by the state's position on
         export license and still don't feel like they've been heard--they've heard from Marty and
         Tom--no resolution possible there, in KPB's mind.) Just a heads up with recommendation.
