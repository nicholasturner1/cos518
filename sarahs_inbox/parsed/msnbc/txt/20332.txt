             Why would anyone think Sitka was a "go", I merely asked how to get there on a Saturday and if
             there was a way ithe trip wouldn't take up the entire day! And I won't know about the other
             things until the investigation work kicks off, so folks will have to play it by ear the next few days
             and not commit to anything.
             I do need to get to Juneau to pack family clothes, etc for the next three months tho. I'll figure that
             out hopefully by tomorrow.

             Ladies and Gentlemen,,,,

             There are many journeys in place today and most of them are based on AWARENESS of
             various evnts, information, views, ideas, discussions, and feelings...

             I hope my comments and datas gathered are helpful and entertaining to you... IF they are not i
             will try to improve them.. I have a lot of various articles to send you,, i thought you had people
             around you that most likely did this for you.....

             I think this may be my (or one of my many) problem; I'm thinkin you have to be stupid or
             corrupted to make some or many of the decisions you have made lately,,,,now i think perhaps
             you just didnt know or have access to other new developments in energy that are happening out
             there....


             So, i will try to forward some data packs to you...(while i am not being paid to do so) that others
             around you must not be doing.....
