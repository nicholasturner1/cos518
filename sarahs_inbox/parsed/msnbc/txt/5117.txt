                I will have Russ work with DPS to send a response. It sounds as if we are doing just fine on our own. We have a
                bid at $2.1 and the individual is interested in negotiating with the state on a final amount. It that does not work,
                we can put it out for another 10 days on ebay. The Turbo North gentleman needs to be informed that any use of
                a broker would have be established through a competitive bid process.

                Dear Governor Palin,
               The EBay auction on the Westwind pegged at $1.9MM and some change.
               We are curious since it did not meet the reserve what you're intentions are.

                I am comfortable in saying that if we were given the job of disposing of the aircraft we could
                find an end-user to pay $2.15MM to possibly $2.25MM.
                If we had some time I would offer it out at $2.35MM
                as an asking price and see how close we came.
                An alternate consideration would be entertaining a different type of Jet or Turboprop in on
                trade if you feel the State has a need.
                There are cheaper Jets by far ! Also way more suitable for multi -purpose usage.
                Look forward to hearing back from you,
                Kind Regards
