                  Subject: Meeting with AVAC I Loose ends

                Governor.

                Thanks for the time meeting with AVAC. Sorry if I did not speed Bert Hall along fast enough . I was watching the
                clock at 15-20 minutes and waiting for an opening but he was pretty steady.

                I will work with the group on their issues and loop the other special assistants in where necessary.

               Thanks,

               Randy
