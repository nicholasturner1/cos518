          Subject:                  ACES


          Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES. Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
          Majority going to ask for a similar briefing. If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
          deafening, Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.



          Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
          "details" of ACES before going all in.
