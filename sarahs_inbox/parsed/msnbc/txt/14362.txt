             Thank you! I look forward to reading this. Also Kate- if you get a chance before the
             Nurses Luncheon next week- there is an ode to nurses that I've read before... something
             about what it means to be a nurse and how important they are to the I'll and lonely. I
             can't remeber where I saw it (shoot, it could have been on a greet card even!), but if you
             come across such a thing we could incorporate it into the proclamation reading that day.
             Thank you.
