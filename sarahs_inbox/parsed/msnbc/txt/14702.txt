               For the good of the team, radio silence on Fagan today--nothing mentioned on-TC.

                       Anyone know what Fagan is supposedly going to " announce" or "expose " re: TC's
             application ? Sharon will monitor his show ... We've received word that he's got something
             on TC to announce.
