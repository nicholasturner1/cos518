           If you see Janelle Everett, give her a big hug for me. Janelle is news director at KBRW.
             Once while she was on an extended vacation in her home state of Alabama, she stored her
           parka in my house.   My God. The darned thing weighed almost as much as me.. And that's a
           lot.



            You can't miss Janelle. She's big, black and beautiful.     She's one of Alaska's veteran
           radio reporters -- having worked in Bethel and Kodiak as well as Barrow.



            Also a quick correx. Barrow's Dalton Hwy Corridor hearing is July 23rd, not June 23rd.
