              MESSAGE:

              Governor-



              For what its worth, as one of your "employers" I support your decision to take all
              necessary steps to attend your son ' s graduation . Ten years from now ( perhaps sooner) we
              will have forgotten most, if not all, of our current turmoil. The gathering and the photos
              to be taken of your rightfully proud family at graduation deserve your presence.



              Some folks don't understand what is really important and lasting. Please continue to lead
              by example and depart, on schedule, with a clear conscience, with or without delivering
              your speech.



              For future voting purposes , I'd appreciate a list of all those who oppose your speech
              commencing at 6:00 PM to accomodate your travel arrangments.



              Thank you for all you do for our state,



                                                                    1
