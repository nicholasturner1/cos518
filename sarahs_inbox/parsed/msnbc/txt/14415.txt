             MESSAGE:

             I would just like to congratulate you on the birth of your fifth child, and thank you for
             your public pro-life stand.  As a mother of seven myself, I am very pro-life, and am so
             pleased to see someone in public office hold firm to their values & practice what they
             preach.  May God bless you & your family, and may Trig bring you much happiness in the
             years to come!
