            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on your new baby! My daughter and son-in-law live in Eagle River and I am
            coming to visit them in June. I read a lot about Alaska. I have always wanted to come
            there and now I can. I will soon be 77, so this is really a wonderful time for me. You
            don't have to answer me. Just sending congratulations. Peggy Marrs
