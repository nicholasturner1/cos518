            Forgot to mention this when I saw you today... I was thinking I'd swing by your office
            next Weds. at about quarter to noon to have you sign an Alaska Women in Politics poster
            for Holly Robichaud and then we'd ride down to the Hangar Ballroom and you can present the
            poster to her before she speaks?



            I've-copied Janice so she 's in the loop on this and not wondering why I'm loitering next
            week.  Whatever you decide is fine, just trying to think ahead here.



            Take care, and so good to see you!
