           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                    No. 08-071




           Governor Palin Responds to Record Oil Prices




           May 7, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement as
           the price of Alaska North Slope crude oil reached a record level of $123.53 a barrel.




          "Alaskans are feeling the pinch of high energy costs. The state treasury is swelling
          while the family checkbook is evaporating.  As prices continue to rise, we cannot wait for
          medium- and long-term solutions to come into place."




                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA_GSP01_0017350

           Each month the price of Alaska crude oil remains over $120 a barrel, the state treasury
           will take in approximately $650 million more than what was forecasted just last month.




           "Since coming into office, we have been taking a methodical approach to long-term
           solutions that will move Alaska's communities off of expensive diesel to cleaner and
           cheaper alternatives.  With today's prices, we don't have the luxury of time. Alaska's
           families, communities and businesses are hurting and we need relief now."




           When Governor Palin appointed Steve Haagenson as energy coordinator, she directed him to
           lead a team to identify the most efficient and effective ways to reduce the energy cost
           burden on Alaskans. The Governor will unveil the plan to address the short-term energy
           crisis caused by spiking oil prices in the next week.
