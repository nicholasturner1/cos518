           Subject:                 TA mistakes


           There is a Bailey and a Bitney TA on top of the pile that you'll see tomorrow that have no
           revelance to my travels so pls exclude. There are others that have no signature on them
           (like Ivy's and others), but I'm not worrying about them. There are some days with no
           explanation attached to the travel purposes also. And, there are missing TAs from the
           beginning of the term when the girls traveled with me, but I'm not going to worry about
           those either I guess.

              My understanding was to be included in the pile of TAs were trips involving the family,
           even the trips we paid for ourselves when the girls (and Track for at least one trip)
           traveled on our own dime, not the state's... but I don't see any of those in this pile
           either.

              Submit them to ADN according to their deadline, but there needs to be further
           explanation on all this so they understand that there were additional travels we took as
           First Family that we paid for ourselves.
