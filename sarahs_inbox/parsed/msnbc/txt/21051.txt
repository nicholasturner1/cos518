        MESSAGE:
        Madam Governor,rnrnYou poked your head into my studio yesterday at the Fox (The Classic
        Rock Station) as I was putting together some voice tracking. . .You were heading into an on-
        air interview on KENI with Mike Porcarro.rnrnYou said a couple of words that got me
        thinkin...you said &quot;The Fox Rocks!&quot;    rnrnIt sounded cool.. .you saying our
        mission statement, and got me wondering... Would the Governor be willing to drop in some
        voice work for us to use on the station on a regular basis? Kind of like our big voice
        guy that says &quot;one hundred point five the Fox rocks Alaska&quot; between records. I
        think it would be very cool and extremely local for you to do some of the voice work on
        our station.  I am not sure what would be legal compensation for you to do some
        voicing. . .but I we could figure that out if you are intrested. I just envision you
        stopping by the studios for 10-15 minutes and cutting 8 or 10 quick sentences. Certainly
        the main tag lines for the station which woul d be re-usable indefinitely. Let me know if
        this would be cool for you to pull off and if you have a chance in your busy schedule. I
        could also arrange to put this together anytime you are already here for a visit with
        Rydell or Porcarro ... whatever is most convenient.rnrnThanks for your consideration and the
        excellent work you are doing for our State. My family and I appreciate it!rnrnTake
        care,rnrnJeremy Hegna (Program Director KBFX)rn227-1591rnjeremyhegna@clearchannel.com or
