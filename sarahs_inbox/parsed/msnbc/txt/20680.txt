              That should work. We'll firm up tomorrow a.m. I need to juggle some things around.

              Governor-

              CNN's Larry King would like to know if you are interested in talking about McCain's VP choice
              tomorrow at 5 p.m. It would be live via satellite. If you would like me to pursue this, I can see if
              they can link up from the State Fair.
