            Governor -




            Bill McKay, AK Airlines - would be willing to put on a larger plane into Barrow the
            morning of June 30.

            You would depart ANC at 6:00 a.m. - Arriving Barrow at 10:18 a.m.

            Spend one night in Barrow



            Alaska Airlines would be willing to put on a larger plane out of Barrow the evening of
            July 1.

            You would depart Barrow at 8:01 p.m. - Arriving FBKS at 9:21 p.m.

            You would depart FBKS at 10:05 p.m. - Arriving ANC at 11:00 p.m.




            They would be more then happy to do this as this would be a Great Community Event.
            Thanks, Janice
