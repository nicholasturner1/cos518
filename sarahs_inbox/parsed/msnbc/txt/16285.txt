                   Subject: Neil Cameron

                 Dear Governor Pain,
                      Apparently Dan Fagan called my Juneau office to talk tome about "Neil Cameron". I am in Fairbanks today
                 and I do not plan to call Mr. Fagan.
                       I think I should give you a heads up on what is likely the source of the call. Mr . Cameron is represented by
                 Wayne Anthony Ross. Mr. Ross was apparently on the Fagan show today.
                       Mr. Ross had asked for a meeting with me this spring to talk to me in person about matters that concerned
                 him. I met with Mr. Ross . The matters of concern to him were two of his cases involving two of his clients being
                 prosecuted for crimes by the Anchorage DA's office . I told Mr. Ross I would look into the cases but that I would in
                 no way commit to override staff prosecutors. One of the two cases was Mr. Cameron . I did ask staff for an
                 explanation. (Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                       Mr. Ross o ow up wi tri a letter chastising me or not town up and nor changing direction for his
                 clients. I wrote back to Mr. Ross that I appreciated him but that I was sorry that he misconstrued my willingness
                 to listen to him as. a commitment to override staff. He wrote back again even more curtly saying he was
                 disappointed and looked forward to telling me "I told you so " after his clients were exonerated. Now, he has
                 apparently taken his case to Fagan.

                    If you are interested I can arrange for a briefing for you on the details of the charges against Mr. Cameron.
                 The case is set for trial in mid-September. Tais
