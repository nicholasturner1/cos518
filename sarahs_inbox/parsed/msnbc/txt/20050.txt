          I wanted to make sure you know that the President will do a refueling = stop in Anchorage
          on August 4. I believe Janice has been informed as = well.



          Whether the President will do more while he's there remains to be = seen. We should hear
          later today or first thing tomorrow.



          Of course, they would very much like the Governor to be available.&nbs= p; More to come.




          John W. = Katz

          Director of = State/Federal Relations

          and Special = Counsel to the Governor
