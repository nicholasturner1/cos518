             Ed board asked me how we're going to lobby Army to continue their helicopter rescue
             service that the Army recently decided to stop. I told the editors you're working on it to
             lobby Army and/or Congressional Delegation to see that service continued. They wanted
             details of how we'd lobby for cont service - do you mind speaking with an editor (any of
             them) and explain what we can do? Thanks. Janice has the newspaper's number.
