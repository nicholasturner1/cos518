          MESSAGE:

          Congratulations! My family and I would love to extend our congratulations and best
          wishes!  We live in California but my husband was raised in Alaska through his teens and
          has so many found memories! We just had our fourth baby March 31, 2008 (my age 43) to a
          BEAUTIFUL little girl Kalle (pronounced Cali) Maria Grace who also has DS. What a little
          angel.  Everyday we are amazed at her beauty, her strength and the overwelming sense of
          peace that she gives each one of us! Enjoy your treasure! May God continue to bless your
          family with much health and happiness!  Joseph and Mary Chilcote
