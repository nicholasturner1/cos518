        I will work on an outline of everything I can think of and will get back to Kris once it's
        complete.

        Sounds good _ and remind Nizich how good our Anch folks are with herding cats and putting
        together all that needs put together. Kris is a miracle worker.

        How about if I ask Nizich to be our project lead? He has the technical

        experience to know what it will take. He can task Kris and others in

        Anchorage to be very involved with the logistics.

        Haven't even had time yet to go there - but you're right they should be.

        That was Gatto and Nueman's idea too as they discussed actually moving the

        legislature over the years.



        Bit - who's working on the leg's end of the idea of special session on rd

        system?    We told KTUU we'd have logistics to discuss/announce in a few wks.

        Tibbles - who do you want to assign this to - "figuring it all out" w/

        special session temporary relocation. Do you want the Anch office to tackle

        this? We've got some kick-butt folks who put together not only all the

        campaign logistics, but inaugural events, etc. And some of those folks are

        in our employ today!



        Bit - is the 30day notice now in place for special session calls?



        Im ccing gasline folks be they'll need to be in loop on steps towards

        special session be it' s sounding more and more like there's going to be one.



        Obviously.

        Is anyone soliciting bids from communities and putting together packages on

       what it would cost to run the Special on the road system? IMHO if some of

        these communities were on their toes they'd throw in a meeting hall and lots

        of offices for legislators and staff pro bono or competitively just to bring

        the Special to their city, whether that be Anchorage, Wasilla, Palmer,

        Fairbanks, or Soldotna.



       Just a thought.
