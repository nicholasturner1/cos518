            Subject:                 Request for Meeting


            I just received a call from Kathy at Legislative Consultants. Governor Sheffield would
            like to fly into JNU this coming Monday, Tuesday for a meeting with the Governor on the
            Anchorage Port.




            I explained to Kathy that due to this being the last week of session that the Governor's
            schedule was pretty much booked and that I would check if this could even be a possibility
            before end of session.




            Thanks, Janice
