              Subject: The Rest of the Story...
             At Tuesday's SB 131 bill signing I was a bit mortified to hear the "boos" from the Construction
             Site Workers looking down from the floors of the Atwood Parking Center as she announced the
             name as the "Linny Pacillo Parking Center". It didn't make sense why they would boo, until
             today...

             From their vantage point on sitting on the 3rd & 4th levels of the parking garage they could see
             what was taking place during the minutes that the Governor and Senator Ellis were speaking.
             Apparently 2 uniformed officers were writing a parking ticket just over the wall behind the
             Governor's podium. The owner of the vehicle rushed out as they were writing the ticket, putting
             money in the meter and pleading with them not to write the ticket. The Officer shook his head
             saying "no, sorry", handing the ticket to the woman. The irony that in the very ceremony the
             Governor was signing a bill memorializing the Parking Fairies in the new State structure,
             someone was receiving a parking ticket feet away.
