           First of all , I would like to say that I'm so proud to have you as our leader .                 From what
           I have seen of your actions you truely have Alaska at heart.



           Second :   Thank you for bringing Trig into the world , we all know you both had a
           choice ... . you chose wisely, Trig will show you as he grows . I love to see the pictures of
           the 3 of you , expressing so much love for one another .   I look forward to the day we all
           get to meet ' OUR" Trig .... you see, we Palin-ites take ownership in him because of the
           special mom he has.



           May God'continue to bless all of you .  And if you ever need a babysitter , you just have to
           look at these notes from around the world and know... we're there for ya!
