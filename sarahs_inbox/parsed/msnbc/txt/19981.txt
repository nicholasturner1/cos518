           Its cool. I'll get to the store at some point here for that. Mainly, just don't want the
           kids to have too much sugar/white carb stuff.

            I'm headed to the store to p.u. A couple of things for the House. Do you need anything?
           I have formula (orange container\sensitive) and mocha stuff on my list.

             Thanks,
