         I have just been told on a confidential basis that Secretary = Kempthorne will hold a
         press conference at 2:30 EDT today to announce his = polar bear decision. A press
         advisory will be issued at 11:30 EDT, = but it will not specify the subject matter.



         At lpm EDT, the Secretary will call the Governor at her Anchorage = office to discuss his
         decision.  I'm advised that this will be the = first call he will make.



         The Interior officials who contacted me could not discuss the = content of the Secretary's
         decision.  However , I got the distinct = impression that he will decide in favor of a
         listing under the ESA .  = Accordingly, I would recommend that we complete work on the
         draft press = release as soon as possible.



         Information concerning the decision will be posted on Interior's = website at 2:30 EDT.
         In addition, I will be briefed and will send = you what I receive.
                                                                1

           The officials stressed the need for secrecy until the press conference= actually occurs.



           P.S.

           On Friday, the Interior Department will announce its decision = concerning the Northeast
           planning area of NPR-A. Apparently, the = decision will preclude oil and gas leasing in a
           sensitive area around the = northern portion of Teshepuk Lake while allowing leasing
           further = south. This should not be a problem for the oil industry, which has = shown no
           particular interest in the prohibited area.
