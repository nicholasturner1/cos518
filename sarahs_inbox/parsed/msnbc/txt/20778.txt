           In the FY09 budget we ended up with

           $100 million in the AEA renewable energy fund (you had proposed $250 million but the
           legislature spread it out at $50 million per year and the added another $50 during the
           special session)



           Weatherization/Energy Efficiency - $300 million was appropriated to these programs in the
           regular session and another $60 million was added during the special session. We did not
           proposed this - it was added by the legislature




           We also had some $14 million for alternative energy in the budget that was funded -
           through AEA for work with the Denali Commission and others



           Fire Island Wind Farm $25 million Railbelt Energy



           There are others - this is off the top of my head and there is a breakdown between fiscal
           years and other details that you might need to have or we will had to provide once you
           discuss this - also , I have not been able to look back at last year ' s budget but the staff
           is working on this now -



           Will confirm soon!      Karen
