                Senator Ellis



               §         I can't believe Pedro is before us. He was inconsistent between his private
               memos and his public testimony. I take his testimony with a grain of salt.




               Pedro



               §           Recommend no changes to PPT. Except transparency provisions.



               §           In original PPT, review provision in 2011. Wait until then.



               §         Goal of PPT: lower government take on more expensive fields, incentivizing them
               to increase production.



               §         The current system is designed to be sensitive to costs and to be price
               progressive.


                                                                 1

               §         PPT credits encourage investments by new investors in new oil and gas
               exploration and development and to encourage re-investment by existing companies.



               §           The main goal is to reduce the decline of production.



               §         My previous personal opinion was well documented in writing, and it differed
               from Governor Murkowski's goal. I have been perfectly consistent.



               §           My previous recommendations should be implemented:




               o          25/20




               o        Eliminate clawback provision that rewards a company for past investments. (Delete
               the transitional investment expenditures credit.)



               o        I recommended a combination gross and net: a price progressive feature based on
               gross in addition to the 25% PPT rate.




               o        Gross Revenue Exclusion for pipeline gas of 64% of the gross value of the prior
               to the application of the PPT for gas other than from Cook Inlet. Gas that needs to be
               transported over long distances has very different economics than oil.



               o         I previously warned you of strong price escalations.



               0         Audit before you conclude that there have been significant price increases.



               0        The 10t floor is a political sham. I strongly recommend against this. It turns
               the PPT into a tax that is essentially ring-fenced for the large fields. It also removes
               the benefits of promoting reinvestment by the large companies.
