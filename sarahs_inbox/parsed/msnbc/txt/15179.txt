            Governor-



            Pat Forgey -like every other reporter in Alaska - knows my cell number and calls it often.
            You are right., this is a deliberate blunder. I am going to make a point of calling
            attention to these blunders to him and his editors from here on out.

            I am so sorry you have to continually deal with that reporter's tactics. He's impossible.



            One thing occurred to me- Beth has all these connections to JE. Wonder why they don't call
            her to make sure we're getting Pat's messages, to make sure they've got the facts before
            filing stories, etc. It's fishy that they seem to have ramped up their "blunders" that
            make our admin look bad in these past couple of weeks.

            Pat -



            In response to "Palin spokeswoman Sharon Leighow did not return calls from the Juneau
            Empire on Monday. " You left me two messages after 6 o ' clock last night and didn't bother
            to call my cell phone or send an email. You could have at least clarified that you
            attempted to reach the Governor ' s office in the evening - after business hours.
