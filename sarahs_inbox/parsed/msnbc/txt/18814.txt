         Subject :                 Bp flares


         KTUU reports that we were wrong, BP was right - that fourth fire was really a flare. Did
         we concur with bp's insistence that it wasn't a fire, hence KTW made that correction?



        I wouldn't have known the issue had I not caught it on the ten o 'clock news , so I'm glad I
        wasn't asked about it by any of the five reporters I spoke to yesterday - I need to be in
        the loop on "corrections" like that so I am prepared to address the issue if asked.



        Thanks
