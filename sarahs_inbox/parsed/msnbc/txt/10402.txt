               Do I only do Mike T's eval? What's the common practice? What W merit is typical for the
               state and in the past has it been expected that all exempt appts recv merit increases?
               Don't know how this works in the state system.



               And are merit increases budgeted for annually?

               Hello Governor,




              I understand you may have already received this performance evaluation form for Mike
              Tibbles.  Mike has completed a year of service as the Chief of Staff and is due for a
              performance evaluation and merit increase consideration. If I may suggest, Mike Nizich
              could assist you by preparing a draft evaluation for your review. Please let me know if
              you'd like any additional information.



              Thank you,

              Linda P.
