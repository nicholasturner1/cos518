           Mike/Russ: His presser makes it sound like he and the community were shocked this morning.
           What was the specific communications with him, Rep Johansan, the community leaders, the
           delgation, etc. in all these weeks/months - especially the communications with affected
           legislators this past week as the press release was getting ready to be sent? What was
           their reaction throughout the week?
