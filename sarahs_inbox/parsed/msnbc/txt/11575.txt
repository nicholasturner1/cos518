             Steve,




             When are you going to write an accurate story to counter the critics ? The last couple of
             days all I've read are Wesley Loy or Stephen Milakowsky articles that quote Halcro, praise
             Conoco, and disparage the administration.   I'm not saying you should only praise the
             administration , but a balanced story would be fantastic ! Seriously, when?




                                                                       1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0010888
