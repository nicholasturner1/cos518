                Dear governor palin. I did not know that had been done in such a gross manner. I have no explanation or
                excuse why someone wouldn 't have the sense to exercise some tact about notice and get permission for
                access to your home. Talis

               No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as its not comforting
               at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who went to the
               bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th event that occurred
               while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

               Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore , I just checked with the Governor's office computer folks and
               they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the
               time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
               of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

               If anyone has an answer, pls let me know asap:
               I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails from
               computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were
               the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it was that
               this occurred. Thank you
