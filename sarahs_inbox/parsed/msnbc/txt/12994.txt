            They'll still need a head honcho in Comm.

             Kris- the gal that Pat      Galvin suggested for Comm, he forwarded her resume recently, she
            looks impressive. Would      you meet her in Anchorage office and get a feel for her? None of
            the Juneau applications      areoverwhelmingly impressive and no one seems to know what Meg and
            Kate will end up doing,      so I want to move on at least knowing more of who this other gal
            is. Thanks
