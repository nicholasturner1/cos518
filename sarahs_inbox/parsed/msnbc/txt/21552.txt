              till I get fixed. I have written and called the AK. congrssional delagation till I was
              blue in the face in over 2 yrs. And don,lisa,and ted did nothing for the vets. I hope
              with your popularity and clout you will make the AK. VA. a better sys. so I can move back
              to the state I love so much. Also I am not the only vet. that is moving to the lower 48 to
              get better healthcare, AK is losing it's vets. Just thought you should know, thankyou,
