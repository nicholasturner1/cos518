         It's one controversy after another w/MEA...

         I'm asking meg to consider all this as we craft appropriate speech for next week. I see
         they ' ve advertised the heck out of this annual mtg.w/ the glossy inserts in the paper even
         today. Hopefully MEA isn't successful in convincing folks that I embrace their
         controveries by my agreeing to be keynote speaker.

         I think I heard you were going to the MEA annual meeting . This may come up.

        Although, come to think of it, you're probably reading the hard copy today.

        Just incase.
