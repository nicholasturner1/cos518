             FYI. This is in response to the press release a couple days ago commenting on President
             Bush's statements about the need to open ANWR. Let me know if you have any questions.



             Thanks

             Dear Representative Gatto,




             Thank you for sharing this information ; it         is very insightful . Your ability to demonstrate
             the link between the need to open ANWR and          the impact the current high fuel prices are
             having on many of our nation ' s farmers and        American families who must buy the groceries is
             valuable . Keep up the good work and please         keep us in the Governor ' s office posted on your
             continuing efforts.



             Thank you

             Mindy

             Dear Mindy,



             I read with interest your e-mail detailing the President' s comments on ANWR . You may be
             interested in another ANWR event from last week.   Hopefully you can relay this information
             to interested parties?



            Last week I attended the quarterly NCSL meeting in D.C. where I serve as vice chair on the
            Agriculture , Energy , and the Environment Committee . A part of our committee duties is to
            detail to the congress our position on national matters explaining our position on issues
            of national importance . We are a major organization and where we stand is treated with
                                                           2




                                                                                                                PRA_GSP01_0016860

             high regard . Position statements are difficult to attain at NCSL because each must pass
             with a 3 vote from those member states in attendance.



             Our committee also went to Capitol Hill to meet with DOA (Agriculture ) officials for an in
             depth discussion .   During our discussion I discovered that DOA officials were surprised to
             learn that TAPS would some day require demobilization , removal , and remediation (DR& R)
             when production drops below 250 , 000 bbls / day. Agriculture officials are very concerned
             with immigration policy but also with the price of fuel and the rising cost to produce
             agricultural products .   Although some corn farmers are prospering some beef producers are
             devastated .   Department officials were again quite surprised to learn that peak Alaska oil
             production was 2 . 2 million bbl/day back in the early 80's and is currently producing
             650,000 bbl /day today . We also noted that Alaskan production continues to decline 6%/year
             and production would cease altogether at some time in the future unless new petroleum
             finds are found and produced .   The three officials had never heard that before and asked
             if our Congressional delegation was aware .     I informed our hosts that it was and has
             always been clear to them .   The department head then advised me that this information
             would have to be bumped upstairs to officials more important than they .     I replied that
             the most important officials were sitting right here at the table, the citizens of the
             country .  That caused a brief silence followed by an acknowledgment , then some modest
             applause .   Maybe we are making progress ; I hope so.



             Our next NCSL meeting takes place in New Orleans in July and member states appear
             sympathetic to Alaska 's role in helping with the energy crisis .   When I polled the AEE
             membership at the last meeting it appeared that we have the 44 vote needed to pass an ANWR
             resolution .  Fortunately a number of our members represent farm states and oil producing
             states.  Each state is entitled to a single vote and Alaska ' s ANWR position enjoys wide
             support.   I believe ANWR oil will flow into TAPS in 8 years if we continue our efforts.
             This next meeting is an important step and I am committed to make it happen.



             Thank you for your involvement.



             Representative Carl Gatto
