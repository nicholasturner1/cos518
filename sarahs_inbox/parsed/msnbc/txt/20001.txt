           Sheila Balastrari just said the governor has NOT endorsed a candidate for senate.

           I can't find that reference from Baldino. Pls find her specific quote so you can give to
           Sharon so she can (again) correct the 10 pm's mistake.

           Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll ask Sharon to check on
           what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check. I said weeks ago
           "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate. Those who were with me at
           the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

            don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
            from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would. be forth coming.
            don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
            shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
