             I am a disability nurse. Because of the recent birth of your son I wanted to forward the
             names of a couple of books that you might find helpful. I recently came across these and
             they may come in handy for your family FINE MOTOR SKILLS FOR CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME A
             guide for parents and professionals by Maryann Bruni GROSS MOTOR SKILLS IN CHILDREN WITH
             DOWN SYNDROME by Patrica Winders, EARLY COMMUNICATION SKILLS FOR CHILDREN WITH DOWN
             SYNDROME by Libby Kumin etc There are more. These books answer many questions that you may
             have at 2 in the morning. I wish you well. Also the University of Alabama Birmingham has a
             site with Cognitive Stimulation information. It breaks down tasks that work on many
             skills. It was developed for people who have had a head injury, but is informative and-
             creative.

             The last page deals with regular games that can be purchase at Walmart etc and tells you
             what skills they help with. I realize you have access to therapists etc. but many parents
             who I work with have found these types of resources helpful.
