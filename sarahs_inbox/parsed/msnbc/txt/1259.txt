Congratulaions on the birth of your baby boy. Even though there will be challenges at time there will
also be much joy. I have a 2 1/2 year old grandson with Down syndrome who is the light of my life.
Thank you for choosing to bring your son into this world. I know that you and your family will have
many joyful days.
