              I agree.  We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I think
              it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change. Tom

              I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in the
              room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
              streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
              understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of.this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
