 dot letter, willow
   airport, oc...
               Todd - This is the second of two e-mails to you tonight concerning this important
subject. It needs to be resolved quickly as ITC staff has many other issues to address before the
race starts.



10/17/07 letter from DOT to Stan Hooley -



1) My name is mentioned as attending this meeting (as an ITC Board Member). I briefly attended,
but heard some interesting comments that surprised us at ITC.

2) "... as a result of the State allowing vehicles to park in and around the runway during the Iditarod
event, the FAA has placed the Willow Airport in NON-COMPLIANCE... and has determined the airport
is ineligible for future federal funding..."



IT APPEARS TO ME THAT RON STROMAN MUST HAVE WRITTEN THE LETTER FOR THE
COMMISSIONER TO SIGN.



BUT WHERE IS THE DOCUMENT THAT OFFICIALLY STATES THAT THE WILLOW AIRPORT IS
IN NON -COMLIANCE because of the Iditarod parking issue - IT DOES NOT APPEAR THERE IS
SUCH A DOCUMENT!!!!



Again, if anyone wants to talk with me about this situation , have them give me a call.



Thanks,



Dad
