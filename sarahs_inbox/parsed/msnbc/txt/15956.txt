          MESSAGE:

          Happy celebrations to the entire Palin family on the birth of Trig! For over 10.years, I
          worked with disabled children, often wondering how the parents were able to be so strong.
          Now, I am the mother of a disabled child and know that God does chose wisely in placing
          these bundles of joy. God Bless you Govenor Palin and your entire family. You are truly
          an inspiration!
