                                         Governor Palin Names Mike Nizich Chief of Staff

               August 27, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today named Mike Nizich Chief of
               Staff. Nizich, who started his state service under former Governor Jay Hammond, has most
               recently served as acting Chief of Staff since May.

              "I could not be more pleased that Mr . Nizich has decided to continue working with the team and
              serve the State of Alaska in this capacity ," Governor Palin said . " Mr. Nizich is a well-respected,
              proven leader with decades of institutional knowledge and a profound -U nderstanding of the public
              policy process."

              Nizich , 56, came to Juneau in 1971 with the U . S. Coast Guard . He started working for the state of
              Alaska in 1976 in the Office of the Governor. Nizich served as Director of Administrative Services
              under Governor Bill Sheffield , a position he held through the Knowles administration . Governor
              Frank Murkowski appointed him Deputy Chief of Staff , and Nizich continued in that position in the
              Palin administration.

              "It has been a privilege and a pleasure to be a part of state government ," Nizich said. "I look
              forward to meeting the challenges ahead in my new position."

              Nizich will work out of the Juneau office.
