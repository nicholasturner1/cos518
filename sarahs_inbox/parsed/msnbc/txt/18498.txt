        We'll have the boxes ready to go. We have a g'zillion quail- do you want to take any
        home?



        Thank you so much for taking the time to visit with Diane and Susan, they really
        appreciated getting to chat with you. It does their hearts good!



        I'm glad you enjoyed your evening, hopefully it was plenty warm!

         Yes- how about I stop by again tonight before getting on fit (we changed it from tomorrow
         be Anchorage schedule changed on us) and I'll check in the boxes at airport . I'm happy to
         take any of that food to wasilla / anch be i dont want the food to go to waste; I'll feed it
         to folks whom we're meeting with constantly on state business ; it'll be a good time to
         clean out food storage so we can start anew when the family comes back.



         It is so good to be back and staying at the house last night was perfectly comfortable.
         Thank you!
