               NCOIL INSURANCE SCORING MODEL HAS REGULATION UNDER CONTROL , NEW RESOLUTION
                                                 ASSERTS


             New York, New York. June 14. 2008-As Congress debates bills that would toss aside state efforts to
             regulate credit-based insurance scoring, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) on
             July 13 adopted a Resolution Supporting State Regulation of the Use of Credit Information in Personal
             Insurance-which highlights the ongoing 26-state success of an NCOIL insurance scoring model act and
             opposes federal plans to usurp state prerogative.

             The resolution, adopted during the NCOIL Summer Meeting in New York City, recognizes the 2002
             NCOIL model's ability to protect consumers and promote competitive insurance markets, including
             provisions that assist the young, old, and those who suffer extraordinary life events. Nearly all states, the
             resolution notes, regulate credit-based scoring. The NCOIL resolution says also that H.R. 5633, the
             Nondiscriminatory Use of Consumer Reports and Consumer information Act of 2008 and H. R. 6062, the
             Personal Lines of Insurance Fairness Act of 2008, would intrude on state-level efforts to oversee
             insurance scoring.

             The NCOIL resolution opposes any federal legislation that would disregard legislatures' ability to
             determine what is best for their individual states and would infringe on state authority to regulate the
             business of insurance. Proponents of the pending bills say they would remedy concerns that insurance
             scores serve as "stand-ins" for race, income, or ethnicity.

              According to NCOIL Secretary Rep. George Keiser (ND), sponsor of the resolution, "The NCOIL model
              successfully balances consumer and other interests and makes it clear , in our opinion , that federal regulation is
              unnecessary. Those in Congress who worry about the fairness of insurance scoring should read the NCOIL
              model law and look at what NCOIL-based states have accomplished-since most states resolved this issue, in a
              timely way , several years ago."

              In general, the NCOIL Model Act Regarding Use of Credit Information in Personal Insurance prohibits credit
              experience from being the sole factor influencing a personal-lines underwriting or rating decision and provides for
              use of updated credit information , among other things.

              Adoption of the NCOIL resolution followed Rep. Keiser's May 21 testimony at a U.S . House Subcommittee on
              Oversight & Investigations hearing entitled The Impact of Credit-Based Insurance Scoring on the Availability and
              Affordability of Insurance.

              The NCOIL Executive Committee vote on July 13 followed Property-Casualty Insurance Committee adoption of
              the resolution on July 11. The NCOIL Summer Meeting was held at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square.

              NCOIL is an organization of state legislators whose main area of public policy interest is insurance legislation and
              regulation . Most legislators active in NCOIL either chair or are members of the committees responsible for
              insurance legislation in their respective state houses across the country. More information is available at
              www.ncoil.org.
