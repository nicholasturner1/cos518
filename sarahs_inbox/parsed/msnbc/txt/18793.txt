          Lyda is on the air essentially that she didn't have contact from the

          Gov's office until yesterday AFTERNOON.



          Obviously I didn't catch Mike' s comment that Charlie & Lyda were

         previous contacted and you two did....



         but what she's saying on the air right now is quite different than that.
