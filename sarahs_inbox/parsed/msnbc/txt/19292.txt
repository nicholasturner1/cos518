           Subject: In-State Gas concept paper for Monday's Press Conference




           Governor, Kris,



           Here is what I believe to be the "final " concept paper for the "In- State Gas" Conference
           on Monday . This paper has the blessing of both ANGDA and ENSTAR and this is the concept
           we are all working off . And, hopefully , their comments will be pegged off it as well.
           The following people will be at the press event, although other representatives from the
           entities may show-up:




           ENS TAR:



           Gene Dubay , Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems        ( owner company of ENSTAR)



          Colleen Starring, Regional VP for ENSTAR




          ANGDA:
                                                           2




                                                                                                        PRA_GSP01 _0020314

           Scott Heyworth , Acting Chairman



           Harold Heinze, CEO




           Administration:



           Tom Irwin, DNR



           Pat Galvin, DOR



           Joe Balash, Gov's Ofc




           Marcia Davis, DOR




           Marty Rutherford, DNR




           I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for 1: 00pm on Monday, July
           7th, in your Anchorage Conference Room . They have also been advised that you will be
           announcing this formation of a project development venture (a public/ private partnership)
           and will be laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay , Scott Heyworth and Harold
           Heinze making brief statements . I have asked everyone to be at your offices about 15
           minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into the Conference Room together.




           I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you, Governor .           Should
           you wish anything else, please let me know. My cell phone #: 317-4728.




           Also , we have identified a series of people to pre-message this announcement to and we
           will be making those calls on Sunday evening and early Monday.
                                                         3

           Thanks for all your support, Governor, and for your recognition that dealing with in-state
           gas needs is critical ! It was a great insight that I believe will push the AGIA License
           over the edge!
