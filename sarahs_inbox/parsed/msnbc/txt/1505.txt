Todd,



Good to hear from you.



Saw Sidney yesterday in Galena. He's doing much better.



Was on a boat trip that started from Bettles and ended in Galena. Some really hard times out there.
People still sharing what they have, though. Fed us so well.



Such generosity in the face of such dire cirmcumstances.



Must feel good to be working your job. But hope we see you in a week or so.



Rhonda

Wanted to let you know the Governor has received an invite for the base closing ceremony in Galena
on September 16th.




At the time, you expressed interest in attending, so I let her scheduling staff know.




Sounds like a good opportunity for her to see the school and see Sidney. Heard he's hanging in
there. Not going around town much but is receiving visitors.




Stop by and see me if you get a chance. Have something for you.
