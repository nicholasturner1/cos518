         Just a quick update on Eklutna. I talked to Bill Stoltze and he is interested in being
         involved with any protest filing by the State. I asked his opinion about including Begich
         and he thought it was a good idea. He mentioned that he and Lyda exchanged some sharp
         words over the issue. I let him know we are working hard on the matter and will get back
         to him soon. He is supportive of our efforts.
