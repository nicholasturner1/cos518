            Subject:                 Walt


            Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and
            his claim that it was only four.

              I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone
            call and face-to-face that I had with Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.

               Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.

                Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special
            Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER refused any request to meet with any of us. He
            met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in "communications" with
            me.

              Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.

            And pls pass on the Bill McA. What ' s his email addy?

               Janice- pls look through sched to prove            these points. Thanks
