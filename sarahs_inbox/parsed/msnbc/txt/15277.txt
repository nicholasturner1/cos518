           Sounds good John. I appreciate your good work on finding replacements, and thanks for
           having Larry interview the folks also. Pls proceed with the hiring of Aneet and I look
           forward to meeting him someday.



           Thanks for the Q and A portion of Dirk' s press conf.



           Our delegation sure came out swinging against the bear ruling. I'm glad we left the door
           open for litigation, as that should show the delegation we're on the same page with our
           disappointment - we just communicated it a little different
