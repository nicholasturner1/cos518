         Subject: thoughts for speech



         Governor Palin,




        Here are a few things I came up with last night, although I know you and the writing crew
        already have some things in mind. Please feel free to pick and choose what may or may not
        work in your speech. It was great to sit down and write again. Whatever you say,
        Alaskans will be inspired by your message. This is your subject matter. These are the
        things you've been saying for years. These are just a few of the reasons I wholeheartedly
        support you and am honored to be a part of your administration. Keep up the great work,
        governor.  Alaskans are proud of their leader. PS-I couldn't remember the exact biblical
        phase you mentioned, but I had "everything is fine" in mind when I wrote it.




        You're awesome.




        Ivy



        Everything is Fine
