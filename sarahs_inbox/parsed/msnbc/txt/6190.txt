             Dear Governor Palin,
             I have introduced myself to you on several previous occassions, (Republican Womens Club In Wasilla)
             (VA-Pioneer Home- Long term Care issues). I represent Primerica Financial Services as a Regional
             Vice President, my office is in Wasilla serving the needs of the Mat-Su valley. My husband & I have lived
             in Alaska for over thirty years, raised four children here and built a very successful small business.

             As you sign HB 162 in the near future, Please know it will impact not only my business, but the future
             mortgage loan business of every one of our Primerica agents in the State. Just this week, in Wasilla
             alone, I have submitted nearly one million dollars worth of re-finance applications as we assist our Mat-
             Su Valley residents with debt consolidation and fixed rate mortgages. HB 162 will add irrelevant &
             redundant continuing education and licensing costs to our agents (You might investigate who will gain
             enormous profits from this venture)

             The Bill is passed,HOWEVER, WITH YOUR INTERVENTION, the interpretation that Primerica will
             qualify for an exemption is a very real and legal possibility, this will keep many of our agents from having
             to resign, which will result in fewer choices for our fellow Alaskan consumers .not to mention the demise
             of many more opportunities for Small Businesses as our agents open their new offices.

             My National Sales director, Randy Weddel will be calling your office for an appointment to discuss this
             issue in August or September.

             Thanks for all you are doing for our great State of Alaska
             Sincerely,
             Phyllis Hoffman RVP
