             May I read final... And we want to make sure we're not stepping on bd's toes with a
             release - make sure I's are dotted and is crossed in terms of them having notified the
             rejected candidates, etc.

             Governor, I just called Mike and confirmed the Board is not doing a

             presser tonight. Do you want us to go ahead and send it now?

             I will incorporate these changes into our press release as the Dept. of

            Ed is not sending one tonight . Will send out to media here shortly.

             Do you approve of this quote from yourself:


          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             I'm working on getting this statement to the Dept. of Ed. (Tibbles is

             tracking this down right now ). If their presser isn't ready , we have a

             draft we can get out.
