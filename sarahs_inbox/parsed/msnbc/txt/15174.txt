            Dear Governor Palin,




            I must tell you that I did not vote for you at the last election but after what you have
            done



            and are now doing, you will be getting my vote in the next election if you should run. I
            really hope you do.



            In the 39 years that I have been here in Alaska, there have been two other governors that
            I have respected.



            Those are Jay Hammond and Bill Egan. I feel that you run in great co


                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA GSPO1_0017673
