             Thanks Randy.



             It's a $1.3 million project, correct? And the state is only responsible to 20-30 percent
             of that with Denali picking up most of the cost?

             Governor / Commissioner Von Scheben:



                             !..s ^ffics^.rerea vad _a^ _ ettex f tom hQ....Mayor... of__En] ® _4n4. 4 of

             the 6 city council members. (Attached) The letter reaffirms their

             support for the road improvements which includes the dust control work.

             The letter also says the Council has polled and found a majority of the

             residents of Eagle are in favor of the going ahead with the project. The

             news coverage on the issue seems to have greatly exaggerated the level

             of opposition to the project.



             I believe the Denali Commission (which is funding 70-80% of the work)

             would like to go ahead with the project.



             Commissioner.     Are there further steps to gauge local support that you

             would like DOT to take before moving ahead?
