               j - pls put on sched in case i can tune into their strat sessions also.

               also, bristol said she called you about First Daughters/First Family events next week in juneau? i want
               them to be able to come with me - can bristol do that Teenage Safe Driving thing that she was invited to
               do? maybe willow too, as she'll get her permit in the summer? there may be other first family things that
               are due for them in juneau next week...

               it's a shame we have to seek reasons for the kids to get to be with me at the Governor's House... i wish
               that rule would be more understandable.
