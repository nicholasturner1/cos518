             Governor:




             Former Mayor Wuerch has asked for a letter from you to include in their annual report. A
             draft is attached.



             I am continuing to work with COS, DOT, and LAW on issues related to the Project. (Mainly,
             identifying any risk to the State from the Project).




             Thanks,



             Randy
