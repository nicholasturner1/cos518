             Hey Rebecca,

             I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're having email problems, so I also gave a heads-up to
             Baldino:

             The Creamery Corporation's decision is not final. The Governor still has other options;
             therefore, the closing was not solidified today.

             You did a good job at 5pm stating that the $600,000 doesn't cover 2 weeks, but then
             stating that the Governor asked the Legislature for $600,000 because that's what Mat Maid
             asked for to continue full operations through the fall. So you really had a good balance of
             one side versus the other. But the 6pm really only had the Creamery Corporation's side and
             that's probably because I called with a distracting comment refuting your tag at 5pm. Sorry
             to confuse matters.

             Remember, the Governor's proposal is just to produce the local milk (not import 72% from
             the Outside) and only produce milk (not cheese and cottage cheese, etc.). So, with the
             Creamery Corporation' s initial request for $600,000 for full operations through the fall, you
             would think based on the Creamery Corporation's numbers, a scaled back version could be
             sustained for the same time period. It was their number, not ours. So for Van Treeck to
             say that won't even take us two weeks - why did he ask for that amount? The Governor's
             solution was also backed by financial numbers passed on to the state late last week that
             showed local only, milk only could be sustained in Alaska with that $600,000. So did the
             Creamery Corporation not provide the state with all the right numbers?

             Bottom line: to say that Mat Maid will shut down July 7th is the opinion of. the Creamery
             Corporation and based upon the Creamery Corporation. The Governor will continue to work
             to find solutions so that the rug is not pulled out from underneath the dairy producers.

             Regarding Homeland Security, it appears as though that Is another fabrication. The contact
             is McHugh Pierre at 321-2179. He called us to say that Homeland Security is researching to
             see if that comment applies to anyone. In the meantime, Homeland Security told us that
             since the Governor Is CEO of the state-owned facility, she should have immediate access.

             And since she has federal top secret security clearance , access for the Governor is not an issue,
             especially at the dairy . To confirm at 11 : 45am that he was on his way to meet the Governor at
             noon , and to say that no one else in the state was allowed to let her into the back area , and then
             to come out tonight and say it was a Homeland Security issue seems like a few too many excuses -
             some of which were never even mentioned to the Governor.

             Thanks for your time.

             These stories are very difficult . Just trying to present the forest and not the trees.

             Thanks!
             Meg
