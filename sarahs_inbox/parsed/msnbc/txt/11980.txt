           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:



           Thank you for talking to me at the Senate Minority Fundraiser at the Captain Cook Hotel
           about funding for public schools. I appreciate that you have included in next year's
           budget:

           - forward funding for School Districts. The current system is inefficient and has many
           negative consequences , including the loss of competent staffing and wasted planning
           efforts on an annual basis.

           - money for more technology in our schools. In particular, Turnagain Elementary has only
           20 functional computers for its 403 students currently enrolled, which our PTA
           organization bought in May, 2007. We don't want our children to be left behind.

           Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for your time.

           Sincerely,

           Bonnie J. Paskvan, Esq.
