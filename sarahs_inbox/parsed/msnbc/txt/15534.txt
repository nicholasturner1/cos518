           Dear Governor Pallin,



           I'm writing to ask you to approve funding for the Kincaid Park Project

           in the Capital Budget.



           This is an investment that fits squarely under the government's

           obligation to promote the general welfare.            With governments

           increasingly playing roles in funding treatment of and dealing with

           mental and physical health problems that are in part attributable to

           insufficient activity, a wise government will invest in developing

           healthy active recreational venues for its citizens. Kincaid is an

           investment that will pay tremendous public health dividends for the

           community.    And the benefits extend beyond the wholly sufficient

           objective of promoting public health.           A world class nordic ski

           facility stands to bring much attention and visitors to Anchorage in

           coming years, which will benefit the local economy.



           Sincerely,



           Dr. Erika Monahan
