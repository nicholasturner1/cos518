                Governor, I understand Commissioner Kreitzer filled Mike Nizich in on here mail search and found that the
                email in question was not sent out of house electronically . We are both of the opinion a hard copy was
                probably the mechanism that was used and there is no way to track the document . If I dig further, I have the
                feeling it will be perceived as a witch hunt and could make outside criticism . If you have other ideas please let
                me know. LEO
