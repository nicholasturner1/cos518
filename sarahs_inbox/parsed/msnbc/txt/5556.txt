            Thanks so much Mr. Katz. I appreciate your efforts on this. It will be a good day when the
            legislators get that bit of a reminder from the VP.

            Thank you!

              I spoke again today with the Vice President's staff concerning the draft AGIA letter.
              They continue to assure me that the letter is receiving high level consideration and that
              no impediments have been identified.

              Today, I emphasized that we are at a crunch point with the legislature given the various
              committee referrals and the hundred and twenty day session limit. Hints, the real value
              of the letter is now.

              All of this is just to let you know that I'm staying on this and will advise you as soon as I
              hear anything definitive.
