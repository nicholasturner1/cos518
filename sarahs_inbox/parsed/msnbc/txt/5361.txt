              I'm awaiting the program and will provide further details once recd.                       It sounds like the
              event is oversold.

              They want you to briefly speak, Meg and Kris are working on that. Previously we discussed
              either Kris or Bristol accompanying you but if you would like a table for your family we
              can check on that. Affirmative to Franklin Grahm speaking.

              does anyone know if I'm supposed to speak at the Gov's Prayer Brkfst on Sat. in Anchorage?
              If anyone has an itinerary for that morning, pls. let me know. I believe I heard Franklin
              Graham is a speaker, but have not heard anything else.



                Should I get a table for my family at that event?
