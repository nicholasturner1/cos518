              Governor,

              At tomorrow's AFN Roundtable, if you get a chance, you might want to take time out to say a
              few words to Walter Soboleff. He's the Tlingit elder who will turn 100 in November, who asked
              Fred Dyson to help create a Native Commission (He was once Talis Colberg's pastor).

              He's not been in good health, but you never know. Sidney Huntington seems like he's had a
              second wind. So maybe Walter will make it to his birthday and beyond.

              Senator Dyson had hoped you could meet with him to discuss his vision for a Native
              Commisison. Even if this isn't possible, tomorrow might be an opportunity to acknowledge it
              briefly.

              He may leave after his opening prayer at 9:00am - so the two of you may not cross paths. If
              you do, I'm sure you'll enjoy his good energy - as he will yours!

              Thanks.
