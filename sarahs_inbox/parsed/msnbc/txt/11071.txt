               APIA is currently working with Nikolski to arrange another small boat

               delivery of between 17 and 24 drums. APIA will meet with Delta Western

               this afternoon to plan for the interim response.



              Please note, the financial situation for Nikolski has not been resolved,

              and there are no new funding sources to provide emergency fuel to the

              village. The cost of the boat charter and fuel is about $10,000.

              Nikolski Tribal Government has exhausted their available operations

              funds and is now spending out the funds needed to support the staff of

              local government for 2008.



              We will be looking for the assistance of state, federal, and private

              entities to help respond to this crisis. Thank you for your attention

              to this matter.



              Additional updates will follow.   In case there are any immediate needs

              after hours or over the weekend, please call me at 250-9686.

                               College, where he taught government and political science for
                          36 years mentoring and inspiring literally thousands of college
                          students. He held masters' and doctoral degrees in government from
                          Claremont Graduate University in California.

                                 Due to his national reputation, Keon was often invited to speak
                          to state legislative committees, national organizations, and frequently
                          was a spokesperson with the American Political Science Association,
                          the American Society of Public Administration, and the World Future
                          Society.

                               Keon is survived by his wife In Soon, his two sons Ron and John
                          and their families, including three grandchildren.

                                 I am in conversations with CSG's current and past leaders and
                          staff, along with the Chi family, about how CSG plans to acknowledge
                          Keon's extraordinary contributions tied to our future service to
                          states. We will be sharing our memorial plans with you in the near
                          future, we hope you can be a part of this commemoration of our
                          dearest friend and colleague.
