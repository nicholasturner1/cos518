            Too bad they're not understanding that we DON'T allow aerial hunting - but I suppose
            corrections go nowhere with this type of campaign. Thanks for the info.

            Subject: Wolves Calls and Emails




            The Defenders of Wildlife has apparently sent out another letter asking its members to
            call and email your office(s), including the D.C. office.



            In Juneau alone, we have received about 2,000 emails and about 70 calls. The source for
            both emails and calls is out of state - only 1 email was from an Alaska address.



           The message being sent has a slightly different twist, along the lines of ... we hear you
           might be tapped to be on the McCain ticket and if so we won't vote for you. But then goes
           on to include the messages previously sent: Alaska is allowing aerial hunting of wolves
           against voter mandates,   the Legislature is corrupt and once again isn't listening to
           Alaskans who don't want aerial hunting, etc.



           I'm confident that we will see these kinds of spikes in attention as this organization
           (and others) use Miller's legislation and message as a fund -raising rallying cry.



           We will continue to work with F&G and the resources we have at hand to get out Alaska's
           message.
