          Flagged two more times in my house too. I had Don send an email to the content director

         Ok dokay- enough is enough. I am calling ADN, as Todd just called from Dlg and said Sherry
         Whitstine (aka crazy hater) blogged yesterday that "Sarah had an affair with Todd's best
         friend while he was on the slope". No, I.haven't read it- others have - it's flippin
         unbelievable that the ADN allows lies like this to be posted. I'm calling.
