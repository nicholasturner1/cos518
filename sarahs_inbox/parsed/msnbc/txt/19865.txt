           Dear Governor Palin:




          I am a father of a 20 year-old son with Down Syndrome. I am a great admirer of yours and
          hope that Senator McCain will select you (and that you will accept)as his Vice President
          nominee.




          I believe that our Republican Party badly needs you. Please give prayerful consideration
          to this request. We are in danger of becoming the old white man's party and need you and
          your fresh face and perspective to save our ideals.




          I will glady contribute to your candidancy. I wish you and your new son the best. Thank
          you for being who you are and for being a woman of courage.
                                                               1

          Governor - Would it be possible to do a 3:30pm in the Governor's Anchorage office tomorrow
