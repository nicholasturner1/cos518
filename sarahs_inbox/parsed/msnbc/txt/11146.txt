              We heard in the last fifteen minutes the 6 p.m. plan. We heard they do not intend to gavel
              in during the afternoon anymore. PETTY

              Can't do that. She must know my flt is at 8pm and I'd miss it. They're supposed to gavel
              in in the afternoon.

              In our Fagan Free Zone we were blissfully unaware. :) just kidding



             I understand now they're gaveling in at 6 p.m. and asking for your speech at 7 p.m. Glad
             you have an 18 minute speech. Can't believe they're being so petty so early.
