                    Chip and I would also like to be included in the meeting with Drue Pearce.

                                            -------------------------------------

                    Chip Abernathy and Allison Nyholm have signed up for NGA and will be
                    available to support the Governor and Chief of Staff on Saturday and Sunday.

                    Chip and I would like to attend the three meetings with the Alaska
                    Congressional delegation. The same for the meeting with Secretary
                    Kempthorne.

                    I think it would be useful for Chip and me to attend the meeting with
                    Secretary Bodman, which will include the gasline and other energy issues. I
                    am less certain about Kelliher. It may be useful for us to attend since FERC
                    has reached out to this office during the Palin administration.

                   The Mid-American and Exxon meetings are probably best left with Mike
                   Tibbles. We can attend if the Governor wants us to, but we haven't been
                   involved in recent pipeline discussions with the companies.

                   In my experience, Alaska Governors have rarely paid attention to NGA press
                   conferences, which usually deal with cosmic issues. Instead, they have
                   preferred to deal with the media separately in a formal press briefing for
                   Alaska oriented media and in "bump-ins" at various locations.

                   Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
                   jwkatg'alalaskadc.org. Thank you .

                         I have attached the Governor 's DC Schedule . Meg and John , please note there is a beginning and
                         ending press conference for Governors . I do not know if you want the Governor to go to that. I am
                         waiting to hear from Exxon about a meeting place on Feb . 26 at 2 : 30pm , but they are trying to get a
                         room at the JW Marriott.

                         John , please tell me any meetings you would like me to put your name on as staffing with Mike
                         Tibbles and the Governor, and I'll add your name . I told all folks as I made meetings that it would be
                         John Katz and/or Mike Tibbles staffing , so just let me know.

                         Please let me know if anyone sees anything that should be changed (even typos !) so I can fix it.
                         Thanks. Kari.
