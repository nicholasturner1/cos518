                    Importance: High

                Governor,

                State Supreme Court decision 3-2 holds the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional.

                There are 40 states that currently have parental involvement laws
                There are 26 states that currently have parental consent laws
                There are 3 states that have ruled them unconstitutional:
                        California
                        Florida
                       and now Alaska
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


               More info including the actual ruling are coming , but shall we have Talis work with Mike and Sharon on an
               appropriate response?

               Frank,
                     The Governor should be told that this morning the Alaska Supreme Court issued a decision in the Parental
               Consent case. The Court by a 3-2 majority, in an opinion written by Justice Dana Fabe, held the Alaska Parental
               Consent Act unconstitutional. I am the attorney for the State of Alaska in this case and I will be happy to.brief
               anyone on this ruling.
               Kevin
