                 Subject: possible bill signing locations

               Hey guys,

               Here's a couple of ideas I Had for possible bill signings.

               HB 268 Motor Vehicle Arson on Public Land , Rep Stoltze
               He sponsored this bill after hearing from constituents about abandoned and shot up vehicles left at
               Jim Creek.
               Possible location : Butte Volunteer Fire Dept, or Knik Public Use Area
               Possible Invitees : State Fire Marshal DaveTyler, folks from the Butte Area Residents Civic
               Organization (BARCO) who asked Stoltze to sponsor the bill

               APOC bills : HB 281, HB 305, HB 368
               These bills could be signed at the same time at the APOC office to kill three birds with one stone.
               Possible invitees include bill sponsors Rep Lynn and Gatto (HB 281 Campaign Finance Disclosures),
               and Rep Meyer (HB305 Fundraising During Session). Rep Lynn's H STA committee also sponsored
               (HB 368 Ethics: Legislative & Gov/Lt Gov).

               HB 200 Workers ' Comp : Disease Presumption , Rep Dahlstrom
               This is the firefighters bill Gov Palin was supportive of. It establishes a presumption in the State's
               workers' comp program to allow benefits for firefighters who have a disease presumed to be
               caused by their occupation. Possible locations include ANC or Eagle River Fire Departments.
               Another bill of hers passed this session also-HB 286 Impersonating a public servant-that could be
               signed at the same time.
