           MESSAGE:

           As a conservative Republican, I am a big fan of the governor. Here in Ohio we have been
           suffering under the Strickland administration for too long. I wish that we had a strong
           conservative Republican here in Ohio as our governor.




           If she has the time, I would certainly appreciate an autographed picture from the
           governor.




           Thank you for your time.




           Ryan L. Bush
