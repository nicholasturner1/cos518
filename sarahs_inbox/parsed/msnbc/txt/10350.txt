              MESSAGE:

              Increasing funds to education programs is nice but will the overall increase cause a bump
              in spending and cost to taxpayer?It seems that budget increase causes some entities to
              consider it as an increase to the to the overall budget for their uses only and indirectly
              shift the future tax burden to homeowners or businesses .Also should not vouchers be
              allowed for use in the state of Alaska?Competition within the educational system may
              create new avenues of funding for the building infrastructure required for schools and
              buildings.If private entities choose to build and maintain schools less tax bonding
              requirements would be passed on to the taxpayers.The ongoing debt service and obligations
              that are passed on to the few citizens over the. cost of a long-term loan by transient
              voters could be mitigated by private school use Vouchers could be one avenue for private
              schools to fund their own necessary infrastructure.Overall cost to taxpayer should
              drop.Choices for parents would increase.Te

              aching curriculum and policies more in accord with parents and concerned citizens. Thanx
