            Subject:                Kopp


            My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is
            going to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai
            woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are any details I need to
            hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.

               He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there,                 asap. I've
            had very good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
