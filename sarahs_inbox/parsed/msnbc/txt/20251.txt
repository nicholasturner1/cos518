              Dear Governor Palin,
                  Next week, probably on Wednesday APOC will announce that in working with our dept Ashley Reed will be
              charged with at least five misdemeanors for failure to report properly with APOC. I will forward a copy of the draft
              complaint against him when I get it which will probably be Monday . This is not yet public information. Tails
