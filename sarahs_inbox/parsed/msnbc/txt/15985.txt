          MESSAGE:

          saw you on Glen Beck... you are the perfect choice for VP for McCain. I love your take on
          the energy crisis .... we have the resources, thats why we acquired Alaska. The key word in
          this general election will not be IRAQ, it will be ENERGY, and you are by far the best
          choice, in the best scenario, to help McCain win, and bring our country back to energy
          independence.




          Congratz on the new baby too!




          Bill from NY.
