           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           Could you please invite Senator McCain to ANWR. I believe that it would be a great
           opportunity to "sell" the idea of exploration in ANWR to the American nation. As
           Governor, I believe it is your responsibility to educate the general public on this
           opportunity.  Our national security and bank accounts depend on your leadership.




           For America's future, please consider this?




           Thank you.



                                                                1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0019694

          P.S. Is it true McCain has spoken to you about the VP slot? After watching your
          performance on Glenn Beck, I think it would be a great idea.
