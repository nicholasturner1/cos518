              Just providing feedback that Governor Palin would be a wonderful addition to the
              Republican Ticket as VP this election year. Happy to put my vote in for her!




              I'm from Texas and am 34 yr old married mother of 2 boys. I work outside the home.




              Thanks for the consideration.



              have a nice day
