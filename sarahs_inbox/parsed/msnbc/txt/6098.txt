        I do need to sign at least one bill or reso while in bristol bay. I ampaying for my trip,
        so that's not the issue - the issue is respecting that area and its legislators by
        recognizing statewide legislation that affects them. Either sport fish regs, or something
        bryce or donny has worked on? Just a simple, short deal that doesn't need fanfare.
