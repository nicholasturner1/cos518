Todd - We received this email asking for a letter of recommendation from the Governor. Do you or
the Governor know him?



Also, did you find out from Track regarding the ANC Glacier Pilots' Military Appreciation Evening on
Sat., 06.28.08 or if we are going to regret. Thanks, Janice

I am currently applying to the Naval Academy for next fall.

Knowing me through High School Sports, and living in the Valley I was hoping you would consider
writing a letter of recommendation on my behalf. The Blue and Gold Office I am working with
suggested a letter to Rep Don Young and/or a letter to include in my application file.



If you would like to meet with me I am available, and I do have a resume of my High School
accomplishments available.



Thank you for your consideration,

Bradley Truax
