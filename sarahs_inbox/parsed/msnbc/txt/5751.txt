              Governor,

             We will look at the tax credit suggestion , and see if there is some aspect of it we can
              use.                                                                         Privileged or Personal Mate
             On first blush, there are a few problems with the idea, though.
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             It's good to see folks looking for ways to try to solve this problem . It shows the public
             wants to provide something , but is struggling with us to figure out what is constitutional.

             -Pat

             Pat, et al:

             Here's a sound suggestion, it seems, from a friend. (Please see below.) May this be pursued???

             Sorry to bother you. I know how many folks are trying to get your
             attention, but I couldn't help but write over the latest flap by the
             legislature regarding a possible Constitutional problem with your
             team's
             proposed 10 year gas tax exemption for pipeline builders. The solution
             seems obvious to me and is in the control of the legislature if they
             wish
             to support pipeline construction and avoid a Constitutional issue.

            They
            can pass tax legislation now that says any company that helps build a
            gas
            pipeline will still calculate the tax andfile a return, but once gas
            flows
            they get a 10 year gas tax credit to be taken at the rate of one-tenth
            of
            the amount spent on construction each year or the amount of the tax,
            whichever is less. It would have to be carefully worded, but by
            passing it
            now it becomes a general tax credit provision that avoids
            constitutional
            problems and is not limited to any particular company or companies as
            part
            of a contract or agreement. It might be a good idea for your team to
            consider drafting proposed legislation and laying it on the table of
            the
            legislature. You could then say, "Here's a solution . Do you want a
            pipeline or not?" Good luck By the way...you're doing a great job
            and
            from what I hear you 're still getting a positive response from most
            state
            workers. --
