             Oh, amen. I told John Katz that - we don ' t mind at all that Stevens wants to post earmark
             requests (tho evidently Stevens wanted to do this to ding us ) because it will prove we've
             only asked for 4 or 5 new ones ( totaling 30-something that include continuation of old but
             sensible earmarks with a Federal nexus )... versus the 154 requests we inherited from prior
             administration that Stevens had to deal with.



             Too bad Stevens doesn't see our efforts as being good for him, and really our reform
             efforts are at the request of him and Young - telling us to quit expecting so many federal
             dollars.



            Back in DC the whole earmark reform issue was thee hot topic                -   from speaking with McCain,
            Bush , Transportation Secretary Peters , other Govs, etc.

            "People have got to understand we're here to get those requests ," Stevens said . "And the
            problem is how many of them there are and how difficult it is when some people at home
            criticize us for trying at all and others criticize us for not getting more."



            Federal earmarks have become immensely controversial , with specific projects linked to
            Alaska's delegation - including bridge proposals and a Florida road funding item pushed
            by Rep. Don Young - drawing some of the hottest criticism.
