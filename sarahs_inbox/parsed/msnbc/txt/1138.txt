MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your son. I found it touching that you named him after Paxson. My
grandfather, Alvin Paxson was the pioneer who established the first lodge, telegraph service and mail
service in the area.

Coincidentally, our first grandchild blessed us with her presence about two weeks ago, keeping the
Paxson name alive. Her name is Natalie Faith Paxson and she is already showing her great-great
grandfathers strong spirit.

Thank you,

John Paxson and family
