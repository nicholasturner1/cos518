               Dear Governor Palin, Mr. Nizich and Ms. Perry,
                   Just so you are aware of the details of my personal schedule please note the following:
                    1) Monday I will be out of the office attending my daughter Eva's middle school promotion.
                   2)    Then from Wednesday May 21 through Wednesday June 4 I will be celebrating the graduation of Eva
                       and myself with my wife in Walt Disney World.
                   3) 1 will be in the office Tuesday May 20.

                     In Florida will have my Blackberry and personal phone , however, they will probably be switched off during
               the Splash Mountain and Hall of the President's rides. My text messages may be confused during the Indiana
               Jones Temple of Doom ride. However, generally I should be able to be reached . I can direct important questions
               to staff for a prompt response if necessary.

                   Talis
