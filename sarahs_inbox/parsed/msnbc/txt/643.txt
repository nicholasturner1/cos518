  Bristol's ticket was changed to fit. 67, but I need to see what her conf. code is.

  IF you have any time Friday, the project manager and the engineer for the window project would like to
  meet with you. They're schedule is fairly flexible. It would be great if you could meet with them, but
  understandable if it doesn't work out.

  Thanks!

  Erika
