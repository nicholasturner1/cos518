        MESSAGE:

        Hello Governor,

           I am IstSgt Terry Petersen, I am with the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines and was wondering
        if you could send my unit a state flag to display in our dining facilities with the other
        flags given by your fellow states. It was an east coast unit for which we have replaced
        over here in Iraq. So they have the flags from the east but we are stationed out of Camp
        Pendleton next to Oceanside CA. It would be highly appreciated if you would send us (U.S.
        Marines ) a motivated Alaska State flag to display for the service members from your fine
        state.   If you could have it sent to this address:

        We have all of the branches here at Camp Habbaniyah, Iraq except for the coast guard. I
        know this would be an inspiration for all that use this camp's dinning facilities.
