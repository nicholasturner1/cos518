         Governor -




         I have checked into the reimbursement of airline ticket that was purchased for NGA. The
         state has no way of accepting credit card payments for travel reimbursement. You would
         need to write out a personal check to the State of Alaska. The amount is for $724.25.
         The check can be sent to the JNU office as it needs to be given to Linda. Thank you,
         Janice
