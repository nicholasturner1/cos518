             Hello Govenor Sarah Palin,

             While I can understand that the loss of the power line from the hydroelectric plant to
             Juneau is a real problem for Juneau, I don't see why their having to pay for diesel for 3
             months is a disaster warranting $25M of public money. Seriously, let's get real here. In
             Fairbanks we are paying for diesel every day of the year to generate much of our
             electricity.  Why is this not an emergency or disaster also. The villages are even worse
             off.  I would gladly pay for the diesel electricity for 3 months and then start getting
             the hydroelectric generated rates that Juneau gets all the rest of the time. What ever
             happened to the Energy Cost Equalization Program?



             Congratulations on the new addition to the Palin family.



             Thanks for listening,

             Bill Zorb
