             Governor,

             Attached are some documents you won't be able to open from your blackberry, so I've cc'd
             the D.C. office just in case they are able to pass them along. I don't consider any of
             the documents attached to be of high importance. Here's the brief rundown.



             Pages 1-2:  House Joint Resolution 19, by Rep. Coghill, expresses strong opposition to the
             Real ID Act. Rep. Coghill was told that you were at NGA and that Real ID might come up in
             discussion.  He wanted you to know of the very latest effort in the legislature.



             Page 3:  Rep. Keller's notes on why he cannot support the education bill, HB 273, which is
             likely up for a floor vote on Monday. I met with him today and he is seriously concerned
             that you know exactly why he's opposing the bill and-most importantly... that you are not
             blindsided by his vote.   His background with education won't allow him to support the bill
             and he scratched out some notes to explain why. He will not use that specific page for
             his speech on the floor.



            Page 4:  These are Rep. Keller's notes he plans to read on the house floor when a vote on
            HB 273 occurs.  They are tame compared to his notes from the previous page. The bottom
            line is that he'll vote no - but, he'll do anything possible to protect you in the
            process.  He couldn't emphasize that point enough.



                                                                    I




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0012441

             Page 5 :  Rep. Keller's message on the healthcare bill, specifically the attempt to repeal
             CON.   I'm not going to explain further, as I believe you've already told Tibbles your
             decision on the way forward.
