         Sounds good. I heard concerns on the DPS side in Dillingham and will coordinate as you
         requested with Talis and the other affected, integral agencies. Will give you a progress
         report in thirty days.



          All the best,



          Sean

          Sounds good. Pls wk with Tibs on this. Also to be included should be help provided in the
         Bethel region via more public safety and judicial officers. I am asking Talis to give you
         an update on the very disturbing environment in the region, and his suggestions for help
         we can provide. (He just returned from visiting his Bethel offices)
