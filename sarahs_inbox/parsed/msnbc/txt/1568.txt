  Todd,
  Please let me know if you're interested in autographing Flat Stanley and I'll send it to you. Janice said
  that her email didn't make it through to you; could you check your junk folder just to make sure it didn't
  end up there.
  Thanks!
  Erika

 Dear Governor Palin:

 My son, Ian, participated in the Tesoro Iron Dog from Georgia, via the Flat Stanley project, Team 26. 1
 would love to send you the picture and news clipping the local paper printed.


                                                                                               ROSTON 02901

  While all the Democrat intellectuals wonder where you came from, Flat Stanley set off for Alaska and came home
  with the scoop, which was printed in our paper on March 19, 2008. Where may we send this news clipping for
  your perusal?

  I would love for Ian to meet you and shake your hand when you come to Georgia, if circumstances ever permit.
  Regardless, please ask Mr. Palin if he would be so kind as to autograph Ian's Flat Stanley, we will enclose a
  SASE when we discover where we should forward the material.

  We, like so many Americans, are proud of you and are just ecstatic to have our families linked together through
  the Tesoro Iron Dog!

  LOL,

  P.S. I am not surprised Obama and the Democrats know all about pigs and lipstick, they always try to deal in
  PORK!
