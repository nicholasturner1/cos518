             Dear Governor Palin,

                     I am sometimes not sure what you already know in the event you might not be
             aware, the head of the Office of Public Advocacy Privile ed or Per Friday. Right now it is
             fairly discreet.    It has the potential to be newsworthy. I you are already aware then
             there is no need to say more at this time. If not, let me know and I can give a more
             informative heads up.   Talis
