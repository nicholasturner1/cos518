             Subject: King air broke




             I just got off the phone with the aircraft sect. They advised the king air developed
             landing gear problems today on a trip to kodiak. Their mechanics investigated and have
             contacted the parts manufacturer who advised not to fly until parts replacement. We are
             now trying to locate parts however its doutful this will be accomplished before next week.
