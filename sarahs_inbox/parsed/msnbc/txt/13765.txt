           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,



           In your short term as Governor, you have showed a unique quality of leadership for your
           state. Your stands on ethics reform in government and your work with conservation and the
           environment has built a strong resume for a high recomendation in the hope that Senator
           John McCain will ask you to be a candidate for the Vice-President of the United States.
           Being from the state of Louisiana we too love the outdoors and we also have an interest in
           the environment. Just wanted to drop this message to you and hope we get to vote for a
           McCain/Palin ticket in November. And, if that is not the case , then I wish you and your
           state the very best in the future.
