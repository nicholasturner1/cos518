        Strange, Todd's version of my email just bounced back--did his address look right on your
        version?..

         Governor,



         Sandy and I want to invite you and Todd to join us for dinner in our home sometime across
         the next couple of weeks . I'd like the chance for the four of us to think together on
         Alaska ' s future , if possible . It would be a simple , informal meal and I ' d email Todd to
         ask him , as well , but don't have his address in my contacts . Perhaps you could forward to
         him.



         We now live close to Jewel Lake Rd. and Raspberry so we ' re close to the airport if needed.
         Let me know if I can get in touch with Janice to work on scheduling . Thank you so much.



         Sean
