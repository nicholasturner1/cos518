            MESSAGE:

            Just read Steve Quinn's AP story. Son Greg is 31, Trisomy 21, 5-4, 220 (fat fireplug),
            textbook Downs, lousy speech, great memory, wicked sense of humor, retarded does NOT mean
            stupid, will do the "Who, me? I'm retarded!: schtick if he thinks it'll get him out of
            trouble or out of work he doesn't want. He works 40 hours/week in a sheltered-workshop,
            likes to drink a beer with his brothers but can't finish one (the bubbles tickle his
            nose), thinks every single woman he meets is "HUBBA HUBBA YOU BOO-TE-FUL!," has some
            congenital joint problems (hips, knees), but functions quite nicely. Still at home, but
            gonna go group-home route this year, we think.

            We were where you are.

            Now that we are where we are, we wouldn't trade it, aches and all, for the world.

            Keep the faith. You will cry, a little. And you will laugh, a lot. There are worse things.

            I kinda envy you, your husband and your family, in a weird sort of way, because I know
            some of the joys you have in store.

            Keep the faith,
