             In preparation for your meeting with Senator McCain, I have attached a memorandum prepared
             previously by Sam Bishop , and reviewed by DEC , that documents the impact of certain
             climate change policies on Alaska.



             I doubt that Senator McCain will alter his position on climate change . However , you might
             get him to agree that Alaska presents certain unique circumstances that should be
             addressed in any federal policy.



            Among other things , we are not on the national electricity grid , and we don ' t have as much
            flexibility as many other states to switch to alternative energy generation .     Yet, through
            the climate change sub - cabinet , we are seeking to address climate change and greenhouse
            gas emissions.



            It might also be interesting to mention our problem with coastal erosion and the need to
            relocate or protect a number of villages.



            P.S.

            Further regarding your meeting with Secretary Kempthorne , his staff has been
            touting federal OCS revenue sharing , and he may raise this as well .  The State strongly
            supports this , as does the Alaska Congressional delegation , which has made various
                                                                     1

             attempts to enact legislation.   However, OCS revenue sharing is problematic in Congress
             because of budget concerns ( even though enacted for Louisiana, etc), and there is no
             evidence of support from federal OMB.
