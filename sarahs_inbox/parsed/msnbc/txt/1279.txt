MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your new baby boy! I have an almost 4 year old boy with Down
Syndrome,so welcome to the club. You will have different challenges with him than your other
children, but you will also feel a different kind of blessing that you haven't felt before. The best
advice I got when my son was first born is just remember to treat him like a baby- not a Down
Syndrome baby, just a baby- love him, cuddle him, sing to him all the things you did with your other
children. I wish you, your son and the rest of your family the best. God Bless, Jennifer
