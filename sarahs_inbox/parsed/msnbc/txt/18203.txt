        Hadn't heard either.



        Returned calls from Rosemary Shinohara and Elizabeth Bluemink tonight - both

        of the Anchorage Daily News. Both on Mat Maid. Essentially said the same

        things we've talked about, but did confirm that the Governor is considering

        replacing the BAC - the one she can legally touch. Both discussed Kaladi's

        offer with me. I confirmed that the first we had heard of Kaladi's offer was

        on the Dan Fagan Radio Show and that when I passed the information on to the

        Governor, her response was that that's exactly the kind of innovative

        solutions that exist and the root of the frustration and disappointment that

        the no one is sitting down to discuss the possibilities (on the Board side).



        Thanks,

        Meg

        Joe:

        Thanks for your response. Based on what you have shared, scheduling the

        meeting after that date is probably an excellent idea.



        We are dealing with some pretty concerned employees who are right now

        looking for answers and direction.          Although we don't believe they are

        the only ones concerned ,       just the ones we hear from regularly.



        Thanks again.

        I can assure you that MatMaid is getting the attention of the

        Governor.      My understanding is that the 600.0 goes through DNR--and

                                                               3

         the leadership of the department is expecting a plan for the funds

         before they are transferred.          The Creamery Corp. and BAC asked for the

         funds and now they are being asked what they intend to do with it.



         I've not been briefed about the upcoming meeting so I'm not aware of

         the options that Van Treek plans to put on the table. I had

        understood there would be multiple options for the board to consider.



         I will forward your request to the scheduling office and see what can

        be done--would it be better to wait until after the meeting on the 6th

        so we see what has been put on the table?



        Joe
