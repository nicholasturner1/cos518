             Yes- some supposedly gave a head's up not reporters) and Prov ramped up to pre-empt.

             Governor-



             You mentioned it to Steve Quinn and Sean Cockerham the morning of the SOS . Are you hearing
             that Providence knew even before that?

                        Update on Tax Policies for Electronic Listed Property - January 17, 2008

                        Policy on reporting personal use of electronic listed property is still being finalized.
                        Department of Law is reviewing what Division of Finance has proposed. Law has
                        confirmed that proposed policy and methods are technically compliant with IRS
                        requirements. But attorneys are still evaluating those requirements to see if there is a
                        reasonable zone of compliance that will satisfy both the IRS' objectives of ensuring that
                        all employee income, including income from fringe benefits, is reported, and the state's
                        goal of not imposing unreasonable record-keeping requirements on its employees.

                        Meetings with attorneys will occur next week to get to final policy decisions. More
                        information will be sent out as soon as possible once the decisions are made.

                        In the meantime, what has occurred since the draft policy framework and FAQs were
                        distributed on 12/24:

                           1. Implementation will be delayed from the first of February for a couple of months
                              due to delay in finalizing policy. This does not delay the initial reporting period
                              of January 2008 for personal use. Employees who are using state-provided
                              electronic listed property will be required to report their personal use beginning
                              with January so that the W-2s for 2008 are correct.

                           2. An annual authorization form will be completed by the employee and supervisor
                              to document the listed property authorized, the business purpose, who owns it,
                              and how it will be accounted for. This form is being distributed in draft form now
                              for your feedback before it is finalized.

                           3. We are changing the requirement from substantiating each business call, to
                              identifying the personal calls, which makes the recordkeeping much simpler for
                              state-provided assets.

                           4. Logs will not be required by the policy. But employees will be asked to review
                              their cell phone invoices and identify personal calls. So if logs would help them
                              in this effort, they are encouraged to create them. We are looking at methods to
                              get each employee's cell phone bill emailed to them in Excel format for
                              identifying the personal calls.

                           5. Similarly, personal use of state-provided PDAs and laptops used outside the
                              business premises will need to be reported beginning with January, so employees
                              should maintain whatever records they consider necessary to support this
                              reporting requirement.

                           6. Proposed allowance amounts for method 4 in the policy framework are $40 for
                              cell phones and $75 for PDAs. Employees can get one or the other, but not both.
                              ETS is determining the types of PDAs that will be supported.




                                                                                                                PRA GSP01_0010282
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com            Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




                            7. No allowances will be given for personal laptop or desktop computers unless a
                               formal Telework agreement is in place.

                            8. The value of laptops has been set at $24 a month and desktops in employee's
                               homes at $ 18 a month based on state Dell contract purchases . These amounts will
                               be multiplied by personal use percentage to determine taxable compensation or
                               reimbursement amount by employees for state -provided computers used outside
                               the business premises for method 1 in the policy framework. They will also be
                               used to calculate the reimbursement to employees for substantiated business use
                               of personal laptops for method 3. Note that personal laptops are generally
                               prohibited inside the state ' s firewall due to security concerns and the related
                               workload on IT staff.

                        Pusich at 465-5616 in the Division of Finance.
