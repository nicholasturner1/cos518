         May I suggest a briefing Monday afternoon via teleconference? We can walk

         through the issues and then digest over the course of the day. That way, if

         there are follow-up questions, we can tackle as well before the meeting.



         Thanks,

        Meg

         Governor, its DNR's responsibility to prepare answers to these questions.

         We will make sure that they are ready for your review by Monday afternoon.



         Any comments or other possible questions from anyone are appreciated.

                                   .   We want a "new energy" in Ag also. Ag has some serious

         problems, none caused by this Administration and most caused by external

         problems like the border closure because of mad cow disease .



         We have a lot of work to do. Ag has had multiple problems through the yeaes

         and I don't think it will be easy to solve them, but it is worth the effort
