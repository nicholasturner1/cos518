       Alaska gov.'s pipeline bill seen passing--official

       Mon Mar 26 ,    2007 8:10 PM GMT



       HOUSTON, March 26 (Reuters) - Alaska's state legislature will approve a

       proposal from Governor Sarah Palin to allow competitive bidding for rights

       to build a long-envisioned Alaska North Slope natural gas pipeline, a top

       federal pipeline official predicted on Monday.



       "Governor Palin is going to get a bill," Drue Pearce, the federal

       coordinator for the Alaska pipeline project, told Pipeline Opportunities

       Conference in Houston.



       She added that Governor Palin, who is a Republican, would likely call a

       special session of the legislature if no bill has been approved by the end

       of the regular session on May 16.



       Legislation to kick-start the project has the support of the people of

                                                               1

       Alaska, state legislators , some federal agencies and the White House, Pearce

        said.



       The pipeline, a mega -project proposed long ago by Alaska officials, would

       provide a method of delivering the North Slope's proven reserves of about 35

       trillion cubic feet of natural gas.



       The cost of the project, calculated in 2001, was $20 billion.



       Plans for the 3,500 mile gas pipeline date back to the early 1970s, before

       the existing trans-Alaska oil pipeline was built, but the gas project has

       been stymied for decades by high costs and poor economics.



       Palin's plan, which was introduced in March, replaces a failed contract that

       former Gov. Frank Murkowski proposed with BP Plc <BP.L>, ConocoPhillips

       <COP.N> and Exxon Mobil Corp. <XOM.N>. Some thought the contract was too

       much of a giveaway to the oil giants and it was rejected by lawmakers and

       the public.
