           MESSAGE:

            I am in favor of any alternative energy projects.



           The 300 K for MatSu shooting range is an abomination.




           I live in Palmer,     am on limited income.



           Property taxes, energy costs,       and gas make it very hard to get by.



           I know of several people that are the working poor. The bread winner works with no health
           insurance.




                                                                 1
