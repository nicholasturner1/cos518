            recruitment , hiring 34 new officers in FY 2007 and authorizing an additional 43 officers
            for FY 2008 .   Joe's strength is his respect for the . hard work and talent of his
            department ' s employees . He understands the role the department plays in protecting the
            public while providing offenders with the opportunity to successfully return to society.
