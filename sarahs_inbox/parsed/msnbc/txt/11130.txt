             Ma'am -

             We look forward to your trip down for graduation next week. The FT Benning Protocol
             office is spinning up as it not often the son of an elected official graduates from
             "grunt" school.  Protocol people are the ones that handle making proper arrangements to
             ensure we Army folk don't make ourselves look stupid, kind of like Ms Manners-types. I
             didn't know they existed until the other day. I'm sure over, the next few days there will
             be more questions, but I figured I would use our direct line of communication to try and
             get a few of the ones I have now answered.   Otherwise, Track will be calling 2-3 times a
             day as these questions come rolling in.

                                                              2




                                                                                                       PRA GSPOI 0009957

              Protocol welcomes your family to stay in one of the Distinguished visitor quarters on FT
              Benning, it ' s called the Marshall House , named after GEN George Marshall .  I believe there
              is 3-4 bedrooms .    Unless you are partial to your current lodging plans , I'd recommend it,
              I hear it ' s nice .  It's the same type of housing that our high ranking officers live in
              while stationed here .    Second , protocol mentioned getting you a car pass that will allow
              you to come and go through the gates without going through the standard identification and
              search procedures .    And the last question is are you flying into Atlanta or Columbus?



              If you have someone on your staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that
              person's name and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if
              you'd prefer.



              one final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on Thursday is being pushed
              back.  Family Brief is going to be held at 12:00 and Turning Blue at 1:00pm.

             Disregard what I said about the car service. What they can do is get you a special pass
             so your vehicle can go through checkpoints like a military vehicle and bypass the extra
             security measures for non-military stickered vehicles.

             Sir -

             We look forward to your trip down for graduation next week. The FT Benning Protocol
             office is spinning up as it not often the son of an elected official graduates from
             "grunt" school.  Protocol people are the ones that handle making proper arrangements to
             ensure we Army folk don't make ourselves look stupid, kind of like Ms Manners-types. I
             didn't know they existed until yesterday. I'm sure over the next few days there will be
             more questions, but I figured I would use our direct line of communication to try and get
             a few of the ones I have now answered.   Otherwise, Track will be calling 2-3 times a day
             as these questions come rolling in.



             Protocol welcomes your family to stay in one of the Distinguished Visitor quarters on FT
                                                             8

              Benning, it's called the Marshall House, named after GEN George Marshall. Unless you are
              partial to your current lodging plans, I'd recommend it, I hear it's nice. It's the same
              type of housing that our high ranking officers live in while stationed here. Second,
              protocol mentioned something about a car service. I'm not sure if that means you'd just
              get a car, or they would have someone drive you around. Let me know if you are
              interested, at the very least, it will make parking easier. And the last question is are
              you flying into Atlanta or Columbus?



              If Mrs. Palin has someone on her staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that
              person's name and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if
              you'd prefer.



              One final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on Thursday is being pushed
              back.  Family Brief is going to be held at 12:00 and Turning Blue at 1:00pm.



              Respectfully,

              SPM
