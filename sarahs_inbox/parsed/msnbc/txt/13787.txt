            To Sarah Palin, (We require a response A.S.A.P.)

                We need to schedule a short personal interview with Governor Palin (A.S.A.P.) for our
           documentary on government corruption in Alaska in conjuction with the "crime" we dubbed
           Alaska's No-fault Divorce Scam to affirm her views and confirm she is against letting the
           Attorneys getting away with extorting millions and millions of dollars from the People by
           concealing divorce ("a private realm of family life which the state cannot enter"),
           property settlement, child custody, child support require the consent of both parties to
           an agreement with full understanding with intent to be bound. Plus, how the divorce rate
           has skyrocketed because of this scam which is thereby recklessly traumatizing our innocent
           children. Please respond A.S.A.P. Thank you. Sincerely David Bartels 232-2045
