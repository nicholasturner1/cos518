            Dear Governor Palin,




            This is to ask you to sign Senate 221, Capital Budget, to include a new

            fire/ems facility for Petersburg.         Our old building is a liability.



            Now, I'll put on my nurse hat--         I sure hope you are getting enough time

            to rest. and be with your new baby.        You're an amazing woman.



            Thank you.
