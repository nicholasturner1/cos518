            Fine by me. I really enjoy working together on this in iterations with you. The back and
            forth produces a much better product and one that clearly communicates what you want it
            to. The danger, however, is that if you get more than two at a time we'll get drafts
            screwed up and people do work that doesn't catch up to the next person and then you end up
            sorting it out.



            if it works for you I'm ok with it, but I also don't mind stepping back for a day or two
            while you work with him, then he steps back and I work with you. I'm not into changing
            your message at this point, just clarifying and honing what you have.

            Fyi I'm sharing sos with him. Told him its a tight circle to keep the opinions minimal,
            but wanted him to check resource references. He's thrilled to do so.



            He's a good man.
