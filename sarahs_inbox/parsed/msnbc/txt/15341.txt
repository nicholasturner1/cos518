          I agree with ADF & G on hunter safety ... those shooting ranges throughout the budget that
          aren't State owned could still get a portion of State support, so pls plug those back in
          but reduce the amounts . It would be for existing ranges /gun clubs , not to acquire land for
          a new one. Thanks!
