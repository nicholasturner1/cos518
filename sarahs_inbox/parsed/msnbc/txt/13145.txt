            Janice- when is this meeting?



            And yes, doors are open. Especially with Stedman in the room.

            Governor-



            Bill McAllister and Dave Donaldson have expressed an interest in attending the meeting
            tomorrow with Stedman, Wilson and Johansen. Is that still okay with you?
