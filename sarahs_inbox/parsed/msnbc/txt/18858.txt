          Mike's about to send his best take on it. About the best gov can do is listen and give
          him the opportunity to express his view on this project he's worked hard for over the
          years.  What can't be lost in all this is that many good folks in KTN were genuinely
          jerked around with false hopes and political posturing. FHM could have let them down easy
          but didn't have the stomach for it.



          Some politicos are going to have to show extreme outrage over the course of the next week
          or so, in order to save face and we'll have to weather the storm without lashing out.

         Okay thanks for the update Russ .          Just keeping the Gov in the loop on this. I believe she
         just left a mssg for Steadman.

        At this point, Randy has called and left a message for the mayor. "we have returned the
        mayor's call but had to leave a message."
