            Governor,



            Hawker contacted our office and we kindly let him know that this was a personnel issue and
            we did not have any additional info.  This was discussed with Nizich as well.



            if we do decide to tell Legislators more now we should proably bring in Talis for legal
            guidance.



            Kelly

            Who talked to Hawker and told him that we would not answer his questions about wait? His
            quotes on the news were brutal.

                I just had coffee with Barbara Gruenstein, the city clerk, who is a dear friend of mine. She said you really should do
                whatever you can to talk about this since you have been buried with so many accusations . But she also does
                understand the restrictions that you have.

                Please let me know if I can help.

                Meg
