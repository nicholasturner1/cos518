MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your special little boy! We have a 15-month old son with Down
syndrome, and he is absolutely the light of our lives! We have faced challenges with him already, as
I'm sure you will also with your son, but the joy he has brought our family already far outweighs the
challenges that come along with his genetic condition. We are so blessed to have received one of
God's most precious gifts!



Karin Matheson

Greer, SC
