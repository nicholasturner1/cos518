           We will cover this hearing and let you know what transpires. I don't expect any
           particular result except to air the issues in a high profile forum.



           OIL SPILLS: Senators to discuss Exxon court ruling (07/22/2008)

           Josh Voorhees, E&E Daily reporter

           A Senate panel will examine at a hearing tomorrow how the Supreme Court's decision to
           sharply cut a $2.5 billion judgment against Exxon Mobil Corp. for the 1989 Exxon Valdez
           oil spill has helped to shield the large corporation from being held financially
           accountable for misconduct.

          .Last month in Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, the court ruled the punitive damages excessive
           and cut them to $507.7 million, arguing a rough one-to-one ration of punitive to
           compensatory damages was appropriate in maritime cases.

           The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had already halved a $5 billion jury verdict awarded
           in 1994.

           The Supreme Court's ruling, however, did not go entirely the oil giant's way. Justices
           rejected multiple arguments from Exxon, including the company's claim that the Clean Water
           Act penalties pre-empt punitive damages in such maritime cases (Greenwire, June 25).

           Still, the severe decrease to the judgment was a blow to the class-action suit's 33,000
           plaintiffs, which included commercial fishers and native Alaskans who had pushed for a far
           greater penalty for the 11-million-gallon oil spill that devastated coastal fisheries and
                                                                   1

            ecosystems in the Prince William Sound.

            Osa Schultz, a fisherman and small business owner in Alaska's Prince William Sound, will
            represent the plaintiffs before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow.

            "The recent decision by the United States Supreme Court trumps the rights of the
            individual for the benefit of bottom line corporate interests," said Schultz in a
            statement released yesterday by the Whole Truth Campaign, an Alaskan advocacy
            organization.

            The committee will also hear from Harvard law professor Elizabeth Bartholet and Patricia
            Ann Milliet, co-head of Washington-D.C.-based law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and
            Feld's Supreme Court practice. Milliet has argued a total of 26 cases in front of the
            court.

            Schedule: The hearing is tomorrow at 10 a.m. in 226 Dirksen.

            Witnesses: Osa Schultz, fisherman and business owner in Prince William Sound, Alaska;
            Elizabeth Bartholet, Morris Wasserstein professor at Harvard Law School; and Patricia Ann
            Millet, partner in Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld LLP.

            Senior reporter Ben Geman contributed to this report.
