            I vouch completely for his resistance in tightening up article 7 of psea contract (dealing
            w disciplinary measures and tightening the integrity clause). I also witnessed him coming
            by to talk to annette about psea in closed door mtgs. Afterwards she said she had to tell
            him to stay out of it and let him know she couldn't talk to him about the contract-that it
            was between the state's negotiating team and the union's negotiating team.

           It's imperative that we speak to Alaskans' questions today re: DPS. Please trust me that
           the best path forward, in fairness to the public and consistent with an open government
           without anything to hide, is for me to be freed up to speak - especially now that Walt has
           chosen to speak erroneously about his dismissal.

               Sharon, instead of staffing the picnic today, please cont to work with Randy, Annette,
            Karen, Mike, and others, on contacting press/public with messaging that proves I have
            nothing to hide; proves the legitimate reasons for the need to go in a better direction w
            DPS; proves this had nothing to do with Wooten, etc.

               I desire to speak to the public on this. I've never gone the "no comment" route before
            and I won't do it now. Again, circumstances have changed in the way this issue is to be
            handled because our assumption that Walt would not like public discussion of his
            leadership was wrong, he's obviously chosen to publicly air (through the union, evidently)
            his false allegations.

               Also, law makers are insistent in hearing more. No fear of their proposed
            investigation, but I'd rather save them time and resources and go directly to them and the
            public on a much more transparent path re: this issue.

               Sharon- pls let reporters know (assuming they show up at the Anchorage picnic as they
            did at the Wasilla picnic) that I desire to speak for myself on this issue and, again,
            have nothing to hide.

                Randy and Karen are working on summary re: budget increases we proposed (versus dps
            claim last night that WE cut it so drastically that troopers won't be paid their
            overtime); vacant positions w no action to recruit; battle over the word "integrity" we
            desired in his contract negotiations that he did not want included (Annette- pls provide
            more details on that for Randy); false allegations that I or anyone else pressured him to
            fire Wooten (even falsely accusing folks of even discussing the issue with him); etc,
            including many other issues.

              Please let me know where folks are able to contribute in this effort. Randy and Mike
            will be centerpoint on this today as I'm meetin' and greetin' Alaskans at the picnic.
            They'll be working with Sharon to allow me more pro-active contact with the media today on
            this.

               Also- Kelly, we're more than happy to speak with Hollis on this, he seems to be the
            spokesperson for leggies on this.

            Reading the comment in ADN today is disturbing re: "refusal".to speak about Walt, even if
            leggies ask.

              1) I am not hesitant to speak, but have tried to respect Walt's assumed desire for zero
            public scrutiny (but look where that's getting us), thus we've left it with a general
            message of the change at DPS. That must be better explained. I'd stand up in a second and
                                                          2




                                                                                                      P RA_GS P01 _0021290

           explain his dismissal if my explanations thus far are not sufficient (ie, recruitment,
           bootlegging that Walt could have focused on with his new job offer he turned down, more
           energy and action needed in DPS half -way through the term be there's not a lot of time
           left to make a difference , etc). My belief has been that Walt would NOT have wanted me to
           talk publicly about his dismissal.

              2) We can never say we'd not talk about this , " no matter who asks ". If leggies ask via
           an investigation , of course we speak . In fact, if leggies ask via any venue , of course we
           speak and give them the reasons . Walt obviously doesn't mind the public discussion at this
           point , and his untruths must be countered at the same time . This is imperative or Kopp
           will NOT have the support of the dept and will NOT be given the opportunity to succeed as
           commissioner.

              So this perception needs to be cleared up asap - I do not fear any investigation - but
           it would be used as a distraction , obviously , and is not needed if we're just given the
           opportunity to lay to rest any speculation spurred by leggies, Walt , the union , critics,
           or whomever is stirring this.

              I do appreciate the adn reported the fact that we INCREASED dps budget - leggies cut it
           (glad they got that right finally!), as opposed to the union leadership on ktva last night
           insisting that we cut their budget $ 2.5 million , and the reporter not challeneging that at
           all!

              I am happy to more publicly address all of this be it would run counter to "open
          govt" now that Walt has spoken untruthfully about the Wooten issue ( esp claims that Todd
          met w him more than once, Annette ' s and Frank ' s alleged meetings , my alleged February
          discussion with Walt, all of our "pressure", etc.)

          Janice -pls look on sched to see if I met with Walt in Februrary, on Hoffman " s birthday.
          Walt claims I walked with him to wish Hoffman happy bday- and supposedly talked about
          Wooten on that walk ( evidently "pressuring" him?)
