             Subject : Good job today!

           You did a good job today for having to walk into. that DV ceremony and read a set of comments cold. I'm really
           glad you were able to make it. I think your presence in this arena can make a difference.

           Later in the day, I met with the president of the Alaska Christian College in Soldotna. He's got about 42 Alaska
           Native Students from about thirty villages, I believe. He took an anonymous survey among the young women who
           are part of the school and found that 100% claimed on their survey to have been a victim of domestic violence or
           sexual assault in their Bush homes. As part of their course of Biblical studies they also get one year of Christian
           counseling at the school. On the brighter side, he identified five or six villages where some light and hope are
           shining-Hooper Bay, Scammon Bay, Noatak, Unalakleet, Kiana, to name a few.

           I'll be in Juneau on Tuesday and part of Wednesday. If you need anything, please let me know.
