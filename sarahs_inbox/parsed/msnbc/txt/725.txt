Erika - This came out of a scheduling request via attached email below. Since you do Todd's
scheduling I will let you take this over. I do not have directions, etc. That can be done through email
w/Mary (who sent the invite). Thanks, Janice

Would you like for me to coordinate this- i.e. directions or were you planning to? Either way it's good
to know what he is participating in, so thanks for keeping me in the loop.

Janice,




The Governor said that I should contact you to see if Mr.Todd Palin's schedule would allow him
attend the graduation of the Entry Level Mine Labor Training class next week. She said that he is
working on workforce development issues and if he is available she thought he would like to attend.




Thank you,




Mary
