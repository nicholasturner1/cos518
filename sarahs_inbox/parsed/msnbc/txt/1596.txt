  Subject: travel
  Kari - after getting weathered in here this weekend and missing the Iditarod, I really want to
  make sure I'm giving myself plenty of time to get out for scheduled events outside of Juneau.

  I haven't seen Thursday's schedule, but I need reservations to be out of here -probably
  Wednesday? - to make sure I'm not going to miss Friday's gala and all of the Anchorage and
  Fairbanks events this weekend. thanks!
