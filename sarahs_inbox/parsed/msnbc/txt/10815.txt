            Donuts? I'll have to think on that one... yesterday I was in the Atwood elevator and a
            woman gets in the elevator with me (with two other passengers). She looks at me twice,
            hesitates, then says, "You're the lieutenant governor, aren't you?" I said, "Yes, I'm
            Sean." She said, "You're much nicer looking in person than on tv." To which I kind of
            blushed and said, "Thank you." Then, she said, "You look much... (long pause then a
            blurt..) bigger on tv." She smiled and walked off the elevator. So, I look at donuts with
            different eyes now.
