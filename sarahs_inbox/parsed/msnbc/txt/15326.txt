              Subject: Galena Emergency funding request forthcoming Wednesday morning.....
             RE: Galena Emergency request forthcoming Wednesday morning subject to City Council
             approval.

             Rhonda,

             I am very sorry that I missed your and Todd' s Galena visit today, but it sounds like others in the
             Community have you fully informed.

             I wear 2 hats herein, one as Galena City Manager and the other as the President of the KIYU
             Public Radio Board of Directors.

             I will ask the City Council for an emergency declaration Tuesday night to ask the Governor for
             funding to repair/relocate a portion of Campion Road that was washed out by the Yukon River
             yesterday morning, Mayor Russ Sweetsir declared Campion Road unsafe for travel shortly
             thereafter.

             The road is the City's only access to the City owned and operated landfill, and also the only
             access to the KIYU radio transmitter that runs on a generator, as it is off the City electrical grid.

             Yesterday we secured a DEC emergency permit to store trash in an area a few hundred feet away
             from residences, as there is no other place legally available in Galena, the permit is attached.
             Doug Buteyn of ADEC Fairbanks was VERY responsive and immediately helpful to our plight.

             Is there a particular form for emergency resolutions of this nature? If so please send it to me, if
             not I will wing it.

             I return to Galena Monday, I am on my cell in ANC until then 244-2184.

             Thank you,
             Walt

            Jill,
            Please Copy the mayor, Mr. Green and Mr. McCoy

            Hope may or not be a strategy.
            Failure is NOT an option.
