             I understand that you might want my opinion on the advisability of coming to DC on
             October 9th to meet with one or more members of the Congressional Delegation.

             I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or strategy. The
             congress will not be in session during the week of October 8th, which is the
             Columbus day recess, and none of the delegation is expected to be here.
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             i WILL CALL kRIS AND Mike LATER today to discuss current delegation relations
             and what we might do in response.
