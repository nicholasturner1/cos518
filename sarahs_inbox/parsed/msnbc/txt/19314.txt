           Governor - I just spoke with Bob and the tickets have been purchased. I

           have added to your calendar. The AK Airlines flight departs @6:41 p.m.

           from JNU.     Bob would like to pick up the luggage at 4:30 p.m. and then

           pick you and family up at 6:00 p.m. as boarding is at 6:15 p.m.



           Bob's blackberry is receiving messages just not able to send any out at

           this point.     Thanks, Janice
