               Subject: a couple of items

               Hi R,

               An interesting item for the French meeting next week . Hollis's office called Dwayne and said an all day event on
               the 27th will take place , starting at 0900 at the Complex, then off to the LbO . the interesting peice is that Marc
               Antrim will be there. the wisdom of Antrim is not threatning , but using Antrim in thier investigation is not cool.
               Likely the union asked to have him there , and Hollis really can't say no and the staffer telling Dwayne may have
               just been a "heads-up". Anyhow, we'll have t
               meetin if any. At this point I think we want to Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                             Rep. Ramras is walking through air an s omorow , so we moved our managers meet ing so am
               and Bryan could attend the walk through . Today we heard that Ramras wants another walk through without us,
               just the line staff so he'll do that later in the week . Ramras will also be at the Anchorage walk through on the 27th.
               Discipline, MRSA, Staffing and crowding are non issues . Anything new should not be sprung on us in a public
               meeting , what do you think?

               thanx

               Joe
