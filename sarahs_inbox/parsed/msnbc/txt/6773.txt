             so we save precious time and not duplicate anything, the gasline team members will meet with
             me - with hickel. i don't know why we'd need a separate briefing before my meeting to brief
             them - all at once during that half hour

              Kris, Meghan,
              This morning the Gas Team had a discussion about who will meet with Governor
              Hickel and his group next Tuesday, as well as the details of where and when.
              Joe will be following up on this discussion and once we've firmed up a
              couple of ideas, we'll get back to you with the details.
              Thanks,
              Marty

              Reminder that Governor Hickel, Malcolm and David will be in Juneau on
              Tuesday to speak w/legislators on AGIA. They would like a briefing with the
              gasline team beforehand (that morning). Marty is aware. Meg is going to
              take it from here.

              Kris,



              In a phone conversation with Malcolm this morning (he's in L.A.) he asked me
              to let you know that Governor Hickel and David Gottstein will be in Juneau
              all day May 1 and are prepared to testify before the House and Senate
              Finance Committees. (I left messages for Representative Meyer and Senator
              Stedman on Tuesday morning but have had no replies.)



              FYI, Governor Hickel, Malcolm, and David will arrive in Juneau at 9:31 p.m.
              on Monday, April 30, and will leave to return to Anchorage at 7:47 p.m. on
