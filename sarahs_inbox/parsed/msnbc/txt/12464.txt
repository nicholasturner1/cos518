            Hello Madam Governor-



            I have been following your fortunes for many months now and believe you would be an
            excellent addition to the 2008 Republican presidential ticket. I'm guessing you would run
            as vice president but I think I would also be open to a female president if Senator McCain
            is willing to step aside and run as VP.



            I think you would be an excellent balance to Senator McCain and hope you would be willing
            to give serious consideration to the idea if you are asked.



            Best wishes always-

            Patrick Conaway
