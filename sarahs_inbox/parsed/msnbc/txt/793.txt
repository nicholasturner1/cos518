Thank you!

By the way, your "state" email account (and Governor's calendar access) needed to have the
password changed, so I just had Karen Essary add a period to the end of it- so just type what you've
normally typed and add a dot.

Thanks, Erika

Hello Governor and Todd,



If it's. okay with you, I'd like to take Thursday, 1/10 and Friday, 1/11 off. Alex needs to have jaw
surgery and his first consultation appointment with the surgeon is this Thursday, so I'd like to be there
to understand the full scope of the procedure. We'll set a date for his surgery at this appointment.



I'd really like to be at the House to oversee the plumbers and contractors that are finishing up a
few punch list items and make sure that everything is cleaned up and put back together; but I think
that Diane and Susan will be able to handle things.



The standard practice has been that when the Governor is in town I ask the First Spouse if
I'm requesting a full day or days off; when the Governor/FGOA are not in Juneau (to not be a bother)
Linda approves my leave requests; when it's just a few hours here or there I usually just let Linda
know and send in a leave slip. It makes sense to send a request to both of you, but let me know
how you prefer that this is handled.



Thank you,

Erika
