           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,



           I want to congratulate you and your family on the birth of your son Trig. When I read that
           he was born with Downs' Syndrome I felt compelled to write you. In a family of nine
           children, I am the sister of two wonderful women who also have Downs, Tina who will be 47
           in August and Anna Marie who is 38. I am 43 so therefore, you can imagine the interest in
           our family as to why two children with this condition.



           My sisters live at home with my 82 year old mother. Tina attends a workshop and Anna Marie
           works at St. Anne's a charity in Washington D.C. taking care of children. They truly keep
           my mother young and on the go! They are extremely well and have brought our family so much
           joy and an appreciation and acceptance of all people regardless of their stations in life.
           Our family ties, values and morals are grounded and close; I associate this to having Tina
           and Anna Marie in our lives. Please know although there will be challenges ahead, you have
           been blessed with an angel. You and your family are one of the chosen by God to receive an
           infinite and unconditional love from your precious son. God bless to you and yours, Mary-
           Margaret Avelleyra
