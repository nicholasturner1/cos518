             All of these on the same day? Pls have someone figure out what looks do-able , I'll try to
             cram in as many bill signings that day- but not long speeches . The vets one is important
             as I need to sign that bill properly and give vets all their due respect.



             So are motorcycle and Capstone events. They sound family-oriented so I would want to do
             those.
