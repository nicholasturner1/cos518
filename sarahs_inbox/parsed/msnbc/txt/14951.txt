          Governor, the great thing about the format is that we can control the message and.put in a
          plug about Alaska being part of the solution to meet the nation's energy needs, etc.

          Governor -



          We received a call from Esquire Magazine. They would like to interview you for a column
          called "What I've Learned," which Esquire has published each month for the past ten years.
          It consists of a page of "distilled" wisdom from someone who is living a remarkable life,
          who has things to say, and who has had an impact on our culture.

                                                             1

           The list of past "What I've Learned " participants includes Gerald Ford , Jimmy Carter,
          Muhammad Ali , Robert De Niro , Faye Dunaway , Sen. John McCain, Christopher Reeve, Rudolph
          Giuliani, Julia Child, Ray Charles , Robert McNamara , Buzz Aldrin , Lucinda Williams, Mia
          Farrow , and many others.



          The interview would require a 90 minute commitment , completed by early September. If it
          all works out, the article would appear in the January 2009 issue.



          Thoughts?!!
