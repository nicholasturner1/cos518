             Governor -



             We followed up on the Cary Carrigan Show request that you had asked on today.

            Cary has a show Monday through Friday, 6:00 - 9:00 a.m. on KUDO. Cary has requested a
           brief phone interview with you for tomorrow, Friday, 05.30 between 7:15 - 7:30 a.m. He is
           a big AGIA supporter and would like to talk with you briefly about it.



            Please let me know if you would like to do this and we will call him back. Thanks,
           Janice
