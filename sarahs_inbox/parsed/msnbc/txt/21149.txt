          Sounds really good- and I apologize for forgetting to respond to him earlier ... just didnt
          know who to send him to and sort of spaced out his request the last week or two . Perhaps
          this is something the First Gentleman could participate in also - we usually do attend the
          Shootout.



          Pls tell Dan it's a great idea - whatever I can do to help - but we'll have to direct him
          to someone who's got time to be real effective in helping him.

         Dan Wilmot , your DoD escort to Kuwait , asked me to follow - up on the = attached email which
         he sent to you previously.



         As you will note, Dan is suggesting various interactions between the = Alaska military and
         participants in the Great Alaska Shoot Out. = Presumably , Dan will follow - up, but he
         needs to know whether these - activities would have your blessing.



         Thanks for taking a look at this.
