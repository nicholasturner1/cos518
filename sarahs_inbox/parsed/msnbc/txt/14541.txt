           Channel 11 would like a few moments of your time to talk about President

           Bush's comments this morning on opening ANWR . They can come whenever you

           would like ,   Sharon said - - and Sharon did not let them know you were

           even going to be in today -- in case you don't want to do it.

           Kind of a moot point since we will soon have a new president and none of

           the candidates , including McCain , support the opening of ANWR.
