            For tomorrow in Fairbanks:



            The Governor plans to stop in at BOG between 10am - 11am at Pikes.



            I'm going to call the documentary place you gave me and see if they can

            do tomorrow around 3pm at the Ice Park.



            The Governor's International Reception is at 4pm. Her plane departs at

            6:46 pm.



           Note: there is an international luncheon at 12:30 pm that I will be

           attending.     There is no expectation that the Governor will be present.

           This will be a casual affair, in the middle of their bus tour of

           Fairbanks.
