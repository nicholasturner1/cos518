                What is with Ramras? And don't even get me started on NeumanUI I can't believe he's flip flopping-at least the
                other NOs are sticking by there vote. The bill hasn't changed at all but now he's miraculously a 'yes.' Give me a
                break. I'm still mad about his original no.
