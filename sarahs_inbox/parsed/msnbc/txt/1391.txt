Hi Todd,


                                                      1                              ROSTON 02502

I received your bio and picture from Beth, and I'm ready whenever you are to work through it. I'll
contact Bonnie Faulk to see if they're going to read each bio aloud as an introduction - if so, you may
want to shorten it a bit. Also, I have three photo options for you, but I need to put in this plug - the
A/V guys in Juneau were hoping to take an official photo of you during special session. If that works
for you, we could submit the official photo instead.



I'm available to go through the bio with you whenever - just let me know!
