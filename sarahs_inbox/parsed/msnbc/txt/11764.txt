              Just wondering if I've been invited so I'm not blind sided if I've been accused of
              refusing their invitation. I'm already aware of all the landmines re: attending or not.

             Great to hear about Mr. Bradley. He, Teresa Sager, and Ted Spraker were humbled to have
             been chosen for this one. Every one in their own way said "thank the Governor for me
             please."



             I'd like for you to have Cora's take on you visiting the BOF. Lot of posturing going on
             there from all sides . I'll cc her in.  Don 't want you blind- sided unnecessarily there.
