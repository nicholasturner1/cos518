           I had been meaning to ask you for awhile if there was any openings and I just recently got around to it. I
           would also be interested in the Advisory Board on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse . However, juvenile
           justice is really where my interest is. Thanks for writing me back.

           Take care,

           Mike Reed

           { Mike,

            Thank you for the email! I wish you had written about a week earlier-Governor Palin just appointed new
            people to Juvenile Justice. Let me check to see if the roster is open ended or if we need to wait until the
            next term expiration before we can add more new members . In the meantime , are there other boards
            you might be interested in?

             Best regards,

             Ivy Frye

              Ivy,

              Is there an open position on the Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee ? If so I would like to try to
              get on that committee.

              Thanks,

              Mike Reed
