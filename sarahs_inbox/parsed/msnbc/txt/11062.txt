              Subject:                2nd Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 11th, 2008


             Dear All:



             APIA, APICDA, and Delta Western are working together to attempt a fuel

              delivery this weekend, weather permitting.            The electricity should make

              it thorough the weekend but the sooner homes are warm again, the better.

             A new update will follow on Monday. Thank you for your attention and

              interest and please let me know if you need any more information.
