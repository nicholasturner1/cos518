          Governor and Todd:




          The Juneau Data Center is initiating a major power upgrade project on Sunday, June 1st,
          2008. All of your accounts will be moved to the Anchorage server this Sunday, May 25,
          2008 at 10:00 p.m. This conversion will take approx. 2 hours. This is a safety
          precaution.




          Your accounts then will be moved back to the Juneau Server on Saturday , June 7, 2008 at
          10:00 p.m . This conversion will take approx . 2 hours.




          Thanks, Janice
