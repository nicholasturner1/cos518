           MESSAGE:

           Sarah,




           Thank you for proposing , and signing into law the $1200. energy rebate. It will help, but
           it only begins to offset the much higher energy costs we are experincing here in the
           interior.




           I am writing to urge you to call the legislature back for another special session, now,
           between the primary and general elections , to consider and pass a cap and subsidy for our
           heating fuel costs.

                                                                  1

            We are not asking for anything special, only the same sort of deal the Anchorage area has.
            been getting for -32 years. We need BTU parity now.




            Thanks, and keep up the good work.
