            Forgive the title .   It seemed so natural for what I want to say.




            A tip o' my cap to you, maam. I just learned of your giving birth to Trig.



            There is a special place in the heart of our God for people who live their faith, and I'm
            certain He has reserved a spot there for you.



            My best to you, your husband and , of course , Trig!!!
