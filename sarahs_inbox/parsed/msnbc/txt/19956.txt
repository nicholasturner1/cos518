               Hi R- the events this Saturday at the Gov's House, as hosted by the First Family, are historic. We do not believe
               they've ever been done before as Todd gathers former First Ladies for their tea... plus we invited former First Ladies
               and their (grown) children to revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.
                Alaskans would like to know of this, I'm sure, so profiling it and/or allowing a photo op of these wonderful elderly
               Alaskan women as they gather here on Saturday would be great for historical reasons and for today's public to
               witness.
                 Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on it , as can historians in
               Juneau who can appreciate this unprecedented event... and please remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for
               the current First Family to host this. We'll all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with
               his Styker Brigade before their Sept deployment to Iraq.
                 An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his blue collar Slope job to host
               the First Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of announcements). Thanks!
                (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pls let Rosanne know so it can be cranked out
               today, then press can follow up.)

              R- If there are points you can be thinking about while traveling today pls plan on incorporating
              them into the presser, I'll ask Kris to find a Statehood person (or other capable writers such as
              Patricia or someone) and this can all be put together if, not today then tomorrow. Sharon is
              slammed so I won't be asking her to do this one... pls let me know if you have other ideas on who
              can help craft this, including getting a quote or two from participants like the former House
              Manager and/or other First Ladies like Bella Hammond (whomever is easy to reach). Kate can
              assist on this- she's a great writer and researcher... I'll cc her in. She can contact the current
              House Manager, Erika, and go from there.

              Governor, I am on a plane to Sitka to meet business leaders all day and will return late tonight. Would you like
              Sharon and our communications team to work on this presser?

               Subject Saturday

               Hi R the events this Saturday at the Gov's House, as hosted by the First Family , are historic. We do not believe they've ever
               been done before as Todd gathers former First Ladies for their tea... plus we invited former First Ladies and their (grown)
               children to revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.
                 Alaskans would like to know of this, I'm sure, so profiling it and/or allowing a photo op of these wonderful elderly Alaskan
               women as they gather here on Saturday would be great for historical reasons and for today's public to witness.
                 Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on it, as can historians in Juneau who
               can appreciate this unprecedented event ... and please remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for the current First
               Family to host this. We'll all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with his Styker Brigade before
               their Sept deployment to Iraq.
                 An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his blue collar Slope job to host the First
               Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of announcements). Thanks!
                (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pls let Rosanne know so it can be cranked out today, then
               press can follow up.)
