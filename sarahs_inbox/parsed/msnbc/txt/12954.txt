                     Department of Fish and Game Reference No.44823

                 Honorable Governor Palin,

                 I am writing this letter concerning the above proposals because of the negative impact this would
                 have on the neighborhood and environment I live in. I have witnessed the increase in drift boat
                 traffic over the fifteen years my husband and I have lived at 52080 Tall Grass Ave. By putting in
                 a State public access-boat launch the road traffic will greatly increase and so will the noise,
                 vandalism and trespassing. The thought of having road traffic at all hours of our summer nights
                 is something I never expected to happen in this neighborhood.

                 But more important are the environmental issues involved in this proposal. The Trujillo site at
                 river mile 3.5 is an old cannery. The demolition of these buildings could put the area (long
                 established quiet residential subdivision) at risk of exposure to hazardous building materials and
                 ground wastes. The Trujillo riverbank side now has an old drift boat landing and a dirt parking
                 lot, which floods during high tides. There are rye grass tidal flats where birds (sandhill cranes,
                 geese, ducks) come in from April to May. I would urge you to have an environmental impact
                 statement under the national environment policy (NEPA) act done.

                 I urge you not to fund the Department of Fish and Game's proposal (Reference No. 44823) to
                 buy the Trujillo property. Having a powerboat launch on the lower Kasilof River would cause
