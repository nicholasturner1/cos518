          M- i'll need an update on Ron Miller' s progress with AIDEA issues (I've never heard from
          him in almost a year), esp status report on $800g energy study that's now going on two-
          years being behind. Have him send me that aspect of a progress report today, it shouldnt
          take him long to jot an email letting me know what he's done to get the utilities to work
          together and present that study so I don't have to veto the railbelt energy funds again.
          Thanks
