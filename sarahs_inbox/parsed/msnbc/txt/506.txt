Just an FYI -



The gasline team is heading to Washington, DC right now and so probably

won't be able to respond until this evening and those DNR folks won't be

able to participate on Wednesday; however, Deputy Commissioner Dick LeFebvre

is in town. I will make him aware of the tour.



Thanks,
