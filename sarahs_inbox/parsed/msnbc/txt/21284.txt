               We are so proud! Great job! Your boys are awesome!



               I loved the article about your sons (though they should have added your precious daugther
               in there , too). Reading it gave me goosebumps.



               Cool picture of Eddie, too.



              Can't wait for next weekend' s game . If people need a place to stay, despite the drive
              they'd need to make to watch the game in Anchorage, let folks know they can camp at our
              house and save some hotel $$$.



              Todd and I will be down Wed night it sounds like.
