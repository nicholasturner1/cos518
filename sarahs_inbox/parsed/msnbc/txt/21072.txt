           Pls call Ken and anyone else trustworthy- tho I usually dont like vetting names too
           aggressively be we'll hear too many conflicting opinions... But a few may be helpful. Just
           looking for any red flags.

           Also, any trusted AFN leaders whom you guys could help me vet her name - Frank would you
          call Trefon tell him it's confidential tho. Any of the native corp prez's like margie
          brown whom can be trusted and confidential?
