            Sarah , just wanted to thank you for standing up for Alaska , you are so right when you say
            that Ted Stevens has his opinions but not all senators feel the same as he does, I believe
            Senator Stevens has long ago forgotten who he represents , Its So nice to have you hold
            strong for us!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!! Evan
