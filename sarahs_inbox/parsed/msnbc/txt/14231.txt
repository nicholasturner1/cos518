             He is not only a great guy but a traffic Guide. He took just about all

             the honors this year at the APHA banquet for all the record setting

             trophies he and his clients took this year.

             Sure is.



            His son Dan was trying to convince candidate Sarah into doing the

             survival suit races with him for crab fest in '06.



             Fun stuff.

            Dear Legislators,




                I am contacting you to encourage your vote to confirm Brenda Rabner's

            appointment to the Big Game Commercial Services Board .         At our recent

            board meeting in Fairbanks Brenda was seated beside me giving me an

            opportunity to interact with her about Guided, Sport and Subsistence

            hunting. I was impressed with how quickly she understood the issues the

            board was addressing and I believe she will bring a very valuable view

            to the board.




                Some of you have no doubt heard how well the BGCSB members have

            worked together . Brenda Rabner will be a strong voice for the large

            Private Landowners in the State and also work well with the existing

            board members.




              Please vote yes to confirm Brenda ' s appointment.




              Thank You,     Richard Rohrer (Dick)




                                    Master Guide # 69




                                    Member Big Game Commercial Services Board

                Don't feel bad about this at all. Russ- if you and your family are feeling led to broaden your horizons, take on new
                challenges, and go through an open door that is there before you, then you are wise to seek confirmation on this and,
                then, to grab it!

                You and Ellen are at a cool point in life where you're seeing new chapters unfold. If working together in DC for
                Alaska's benefit is appealing to you, I support you and it can be a very good thing for you and our state.

                Thank you!

                Governor,

                I'm sorry for the mix-up. The D.C. discussion was supposed to occur after session. I was going to ask your
                permission, once the dust had settled... next week.



                I apologize for not having brought it up before you heard from John. That was not my intention and I feel badly
                about it.
