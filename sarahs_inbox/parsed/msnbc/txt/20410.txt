               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                     No. 08-142

                                 Baby Shower Honoring Trig Palin to Benefit Soldiers
               August 15, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today announced she will attend a baby
               shower in Trig Palin's honor next week and that all gifts will be donated to help military families.

               Proceeds from the event will benefit the Family Ties Foundation. The foundation is a non-profit
               organization created to provide immediate support for the military families of wounded service
               members deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. The
               event is being hosted by local morning radio personalities Bob and Mark from 106.5 KWHL.

               "My family has been so blessed by the arrival of Trig. It is my honor to share that blessing with
               our men and women in uniform through this event,", Governor Palin said. "I invite all Alaskans
               who'd like to support our wonderful military families to participate."

               The event will take place at Romano's restaurant, on Fireweed Lane at C Street, on Monday from 5
               to 7 p.m. The public is invited. Romano's restaurant will donate a portion of the sales from the
               evening to the Family Ties Foundation.
