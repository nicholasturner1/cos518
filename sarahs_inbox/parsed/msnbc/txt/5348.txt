                  Commissioner.

                      Thank you for inviting us to the roll out of AGIA on Friday. I was glad that David Gottstein made it.
                  My plane was diverted to Yakutat, but I heard the press conference via the internet and watched the
                  Gavel to Gavel re-play last evening.

                       Please pass on my congratulations to Governor Palin and your team . The presentation was clear
                  and strong, and Backbone II commends all of you on the package you have assembled . We will meet
                  today and review the details of the legislation . We plan to attend the Town Hall meetings this evening,
                  and you can count on our support for legislative passage this session.
