             Very, very odd. And disappointing. I hope they at least invited Kristan and Joey and
             others!  Wonder if Lyda had anything to do w this.

             Oh my goodness. No, we did not receive an invitation and I'm calling Kyle this morning.
             He and I spoke a few weeks back and he said they weren't ready yet for a grand opening
             celebration but that he'd coordinate with me on your schedule once they were. I have not
             heard anything back from him since that conversation. This is unbelievable. Yesterday, I
             recd an email from Dick Lefebrve that Senator Stevens was stopping by the new creamery
             and that was it, nothing more than that. I'll go thru old emails from him or anyone else
             to make sure I didn't miss anything, but am pretty darn certain I did not. So, in other
             words, everyone that had NOTHING to do with this were there and those that BUSTED THEIR
             BUTT weren't even invited. I'm calling Kyle.

            Kris- if you read the article this morning you'll see something's fishy about it be the
            creamery claims it's success is due to Lyda's support- and everyone under the sun was
            there at the grand opening incl Stevens, Young, local elected officials, etc. Are we sure
            we didn't get any invitation to attend? -----Original Message----- From:

             our support at the new creamery's grand opening - we'd cut the ribbon or whatever - I see
             in adn they already did it. Did Beus or anyone ever invite us to kick this off for them?
