               You rock. Thanks for you letter to Reid. Hopefully McCain will adjust his rhetoric and
               think about the next ten to twenty years instead of pandering to the liberal congress that
               is so self absorbed.




               I have a bunch of Pararescue buddies that live in your great state, I hope to visit some
               day.
