        Thanks for the great event today Annette! That was fun - and it was great to see your
        husband there too.




        Do you know of this issue mentioned in the email below? My brother is asking about someone
        who lost a contract with the state. Pls see below.

       I'll call a few kids and see if they can make it. I

       won't be at school Monday because I'll be at your

       Volunteer Awards at the Sheraton.



       A guy on my hockey team, Dave Eibeck (who you've met a

       couple of times because he campaigned for you) told me

       last night that someone in Dept. of Admin (in charge
                                                              1

        of procurement) is playing favorites. He owns Royal

        Business Systems and they sell and service copiers

        around the state. He said he lost his Valley contract

        with the State because they told him he wasn't

        qualified to work on machines there... even though he

        works on State machines every where else from

        Southeast to Fairbanks.



        Voice of the Times sounds desperate now. Keep it

        positive and ignore them.



        Did Track like the bike? We are going to Wasilla

        today.
