          MESSAGE:

          I would like to invite Governor Palin to speak at our 10th Annual Water Professionals
          Conference in November. The event is held to educate water and wastewater operators and
          administrative staff to ensure the Public Health throughout rural Alaska. Many of these
          professionals obtain a large portion of their Continuing Education Units (CEU's) that are
          required for licensing every year at this conference. It would be our honor if during this
          event Ms. Palin would speak on behalf of the State of Alaska and Public Health issues.
          The conference is November 3-6, 2008. Please let me know at your earliest convenience.
          Thank you..




          Regards,



          Hilary J Currey
