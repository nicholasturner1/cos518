          Please let me know as this is a scheduling request why it went directly to Katie. I would
          be happy to answer this if it has not already been addressed. Thanks, Janice

              Colleen,

             The specific reporter I spoke with was Rena Delbridge at the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Her number is 459-
             7518. If at all possible, could a clarification be made with her?
