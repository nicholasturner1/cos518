  Hi Todd,

  Here's a sample of the fllyer. Linda and I thought it should say your name on it- but we can
  change it to "JOIN US" instead of your name if your prefer that. Let me know if this works, or if
  you'd like ANY changes.

  AK Trails wanted to know if February 20 or 21st would work; they really want the Iron Dog
  champion for their PSA.

 Thanks,
 Erika

 Thanks,
 Erika
