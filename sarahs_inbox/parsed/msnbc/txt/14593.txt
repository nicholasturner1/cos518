                Subject: Speaker Harris ref. may AGIA briefings

              Governor-

              Speaker Harris emailed all House members:

              Since the same information will be offered in Juneau during our special session in early June, I will
              not be reimbursing any member or staff for travel or per diem to Anchorage for the Governor's
              briefing on AGIA. If you want to attend you certainly can do so, but I will not reimburse you for any
              expenses you incur.

              Steve Quinn is the only member of the media who has called on this. Joe Balash is responding
              saying - it is important to the Governor that we have these briefings on the road system so the
              public can participate. We understand that not every lawmaker will be available to attend but we
              certainly encourage them to take advantage of this opportunity. We are hearing from some
              lawmakers that they will be attending on their own dime. The information will be presented in a
              fashion unlike a committee hearing in Juneau.
