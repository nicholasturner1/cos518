               Dear Anna
               Thanks for serving our community . Please vote yes on Proposition 4 so the State of Alaska will
               appropriate funds to match the 2 million pool repair bond . We need to maintain the assets for safety and
               health in Alaska . I remember when we had only the one private pool and we fought for a pool at West.
               Thanks for caring and being involved in community to make a difference.
