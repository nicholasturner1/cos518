               Subject: Paradigm Shift-volunteers augmenting fed and state dollars

             I went to the first part of a hearing where Sen. Stevens and Sen. Landrieu of Lousiana were
             conducting a field hearing on erosion damage and control related to Shishmaref , Kivalina, and
             Newtok . In talking about federal dollars for relocation efforts , Sen. Landrieu said, "We want
             some kind of a new paradigm -- using private sector resources in addition to federal ..." "We're
             all struggling with how to do that."

             Larry Hartig and I have been talking about this in the Village Safe Water context as in how to
            marshall volunteer/ nonprofit resources successfully in the villages to accelerate water/sewer
            improvements. We're discussing specifically how to use volunteers alongside villagers in
            Hooper Bay where Samaritans Purse seems to have made some positive inroads by
            incorporating workforce development principles in their home building project (training kids
            from high school in carpentry and the kids getting credit for the work ). DEC's current plan is
            for one cluster of homes to be connected to the w /s system next summer and another cluster
            of homes in Hooper is scheduled for connect in 2009 or 2010 (with a final cluster in old town
            slated for 2012 or 13-though this batch is questionable). We're thinking on how to gather
            volunteer resources with the paid contractors and village labor to connect both clusters of
            homes in one summer construction season (2008) rather than two.

            If it works as a pilot project , maybe it could be used in relocation efforts where Alaskans
            associated with Habitat for Humanity , for example , can voluntarily work to build new homes
            next to paid and volunteer village labor. Ties in with Sen . Landrieu's remarks about the feds
            looking for a new paradigm -code for, "We can 't pay for all this as government." Just an FYI at
            this point.

               Subject: Maritime Union negotiations

             Governor:

             I spoke with Mike T. this morning and he thought I should give you this heads up.

            You'll remember in Cabinet meetings, I've mentioned how tough I anticipated these
            negotiations with the maritime unions to be. The Inland Boatman's Union (IBU)
            turned down a 1-year extension which included a 3% pay increase apparently due to
            not receiving $11/month/employee toward health benefits. The other two unions
            (MEBA & MM&P) did accept the one-year rollover.

            We are now in negotiations with all three maritime unions and today I am putting on
            the table some pretty ugly counter offers. Ferry system employees get free passes,
            ostensibly on a "space available" basis. This just seems unconscionable when the
            system is projected to run a $90 million deficit for FY09. Commissioner von Scheben
            and I are working closely together to achieve savings in these contracts. Here is a
            link to a JNU Empire story which ran today, where von Scheben outlines difficulties
            with funding:
            http://www.,juneauempire.comIstories./101107/sta 20071011013 shtml


            There will be negative press about our negotiations. However, we will not be able to
            hold the line on spending if we don't go in tough here. I am planning on meeting with
            Southeast legislators October 18 and 19 when they are here for Special Session. Ivy
            is gathering the names of the Southeast Mayors so that I can start talking with them
            as well. I also plan to meet with Cathie Roemmich of the MTAB.

            I think it will be Juneau's delegation that will scream the loudest, but I don't know.

           Please let me know if you want or need additional information right now.
