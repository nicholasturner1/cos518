              Hello Governor,

              The account at Alaska Cleaners is AK43254 and titled Office of the Governor . If additional staff or family
              members need to be added to the account , please let me know. The account is good at all of their Anchorage
              and Wasilla locations.

              I really look forward to seeing you and Willow! Piper has an open TA to return to Juneau, and there are picnics
              scheduled in Anchorage to process another TA. Just a thought...

              Have a great weekend!
              Erika

              Hi Kris,

              Please have someone collect the receipts and send them to the House, as they're paid through that account.
              If there are any problems, please let me know right away so we can work them out.
