            We'll get veggies and fruit for the girls. I'll look into setting up an account at El
            Sombrero, it shouldn't be a problem. I think it will really be good for Willow to jump
            right into Hoop Time!! I'm excited for you and the girls to get to Juneau. I'll be
            praying for you and your family!! Thanks, Erika

           Pls get fresh fruit and veggies for our return on friday- Todd may contact you with
           anything else - but our goal will be to have healthy foods there for the girls and as
           little processed foods as possible. Thanks! Willow may FINALLY be getting happy about her
           return to DZ - Piper is totally excited to get back there! So am I!



           Do we have an account at El Sombrero's? May we?
