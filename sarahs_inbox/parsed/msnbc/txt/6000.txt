          Arghl!!  Thanks for your encouragement - that was a cluster yest and put me easily an hour
          behind on the day's schedule. Hate to sound demanding to scheduling staffers, but I knew I
          was keeping company CEOs waiting also. Pretty ridiculous. We'll see if today's call goes
          any better.

         Governor,



         I am sending this from Marty and I.. Right up front I apologize if we

         are stepping into an area that is not our business. We care a lot so

         here goes.      The flurry of email on calls to the various companies makes

         us frustrated for you. Respectfully, your time is way more important

         than worrying about times and numbers. In DNR and other places we have

         worked we are use to having staff arrange calls with company individuals

         in State and them working out clear times and numbers agreeable to both

         parties for these high level calls, even to who calls who.                  You have so

         many issues to focus on and your time is priceless. We could use some

         of that time reviewing numerous oil, gas, land and other issues with

         you.      I am sure other Departments must feel the same. We both need to

         get out with employees. More people need to do more for you.                   We are

         willing to help.      Again we care a lot. Please take these comments in

         that sense.     We are proud to work for you as Governor! Respectfully
                                                                1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0002774
