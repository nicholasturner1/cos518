          Thank you Talis.



          I agree. If Mr. Cashen feels his client is innocent of murdering 19 year old Sonya
          Ivanoff he can file motions for post-conviction relief, new trial, whatever legal method
          is used in the courts and allowed under the law.



         Also, the case made front page news and had some racial overtones. I think several rural
         legislators were very interested in the investigation and outcome of this case. The
         defendant was a non-native police officer, the victim was native, and troopers conducted
         the investigation.  Some people in Nome were concerned whether the investigation and the
         trial would be conducted fairly.  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

            Leggies, state staffers, too. That will allow me a shorter speech- to introduce them all.

            A few days ago I requested a list of any dignitaries attending. As of yesterday, didn't
            receive and spoke w/Ray Dah - he said he only knows of Hickel but 1'11 keep my eye out.
