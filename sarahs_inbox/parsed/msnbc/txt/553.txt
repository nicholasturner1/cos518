  Hello Todd,

  I don't think you've ever used the state email account that was set up for you. If you would like to keep it
  for future use, just let me know. They are in the process of transitioning to a new mail system and would
  need to reset your password.

  Thanks!
  Erika

 Erika, we setup a Governor's office email account for Todd Palin when Governor Palin took office. I don't
 know whether he has made use of it. If he uses this account or ever intends to, I need to transition it to
 the new Exchange mail system and I will need to reset his pw.

 Do you know or can you find out if he uses this account?
