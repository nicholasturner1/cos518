          Good point. I expect we will hear more about that. Hopefully the initial flap will die
          down after a couple of days. Karen

           For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
          capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or
          understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operating
          budget   PrivilanPrt nr Parcnnal Matarial Rartaetari
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




          The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the
         process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
         her budget.
