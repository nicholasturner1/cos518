         Kyle was traveling until yesterday early afternoon.    I left a message for him first thing
         in the morning but he did not call back until about 2:00. I was able to reach Bert early
         in the morning and he even admited to me that he knew the announcement was coming two days
         ago. Even though Leo made his comments at the Ketchikan Chamber and were covered widely
         by the news, they still argued that we were not clear. Bert restated this when I called
         him back yesterday afternoon.



         I talked to Mayor Williams yesterday and he requested a meeting with you preferably in
         Ketchikan but he said he could travel if that was not possible.




         Mike

         Mike/Russ/Randy: Holy moly - Kyle Johanson's comments are as biting as Bert Stedman's were
         (in adn this morning). When did you guys talk to them - when the presser was first crafted
         on Monday? Why do they say they were shocked yesterday?

         Bert didn't sound as angry as "shocked" when I talked to him yesterday, but even that
         surpsrised me because I'm assuming this was communicated to him at the beginning of the
         week.



        Also, as Sharon knows, the Stevens story grew legs NOT out of any "demand" I made for him
        to talk to Alaskans, as KTUU reported last night. When asked three times in two days by
        different reporters if I thought Stevens should talk about the investigation, I did say I
        thought Alaskans want to hear any information he can provide, and it's appropriate and
                                                                 1

         deserved to give him the benefit of the doubt - and Alaskans get frustrated when he can't
         or isn't providing information on his innocence.



         It's very clear the adn reporter made my comments sound more inciteful than necessary. AP
         report was more in context , but the headline was rough . I'm not "demanding" Stevens do
         anything , just as I'm not "demanding " state senate leadership strip Cowdery of Rules - I
         won't tell anyone what to do and I don't have the authority to do so anyway. These
         questions have been impossible to avoid and I'll continue to give my opinion, but it's
         unfortunate the Stevens comment is made to sound more controversial than I intended.
