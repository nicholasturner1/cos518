                 Subject: ANWR/Congressman Ralph Hall - CONFIDENTIAUATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

               Congressman Ralph Hall (Republican, Texas) called this morning to seek your support for draft legislation
               (pasted below) that would convey the Coastal Plain of ANWR to the State of Alaska in order to facilitate oil and
               gas development there. The Congressman is working closely with Congressman Young on the bill and says that
               he has discussed it personally with President Bush, who would sign the legislation if it gets to his desk.

               I was non-committal pending this communication to you. There is no question that the Palin administration
               supports responsible oil and gas development in the Coastal Plain. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

               The legislation would also require a 50/50 revenue share between the State and federal governments and would
               impose a prohibition on oil exports . With the exception of a few Alaskans , most people believe that these
               requirements are inevitable in any ANWR bill that has a chance of passing.

               Recommendation: I don't know whether the following would be completely acceptable to Mr. Hall, but I would
               recommend the statement below in response -

              Privi I'll stand by for further guidance from you.

               P.S.
               Mr. Hall would like to introduce his bill tomorrow but said that he could wait until next week.
