              Dear Governor Palin,

                    I just got this. This is sort of strange. I am being advised by Tillery to attend
              a meeting with you and Lt. Governor that no one else has asked me to attend. Would you
              like me to attend? Talis

              It appears likely that there will be a meeting with the Governor and Lt. Governor tomorrow
              at 10:00 regarding the proposed Pebble settlement. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
