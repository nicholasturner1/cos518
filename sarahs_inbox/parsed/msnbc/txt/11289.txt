            Governor and Sharon,



            For full disclosure sake, I have been contacted by Wendy Chamberlain (lobbyist for Prov
            right afer the SOS) to have a brief meeting next week with her and Lori Herman of Prov to
            discuss their "proposal/idea".   I only promised to hear them out but that my direction is
            clear from the Governor. I suspect that I may be contacted by others but I am assuming
            Prov is representing many efforts-it will be interesting to find out what they may be
            thinking and it may help our strategy.



            Anna
