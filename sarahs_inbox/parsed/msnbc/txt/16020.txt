          You're on the right track(you know what I REALLY want to say tho!) - but add that in
          Barrow, from what I understand, the residents are already serviced by natural gas and pay
          the lowest cost for energy... So not sure what the AGIA mission is up there (except to
          drag this out like Charlie and Ralph amd others truly want to do...). The message to Matt
          is that the leggies haven't been real clear what their road show is all about (c'mon,.
          Barrow and Ketchikan! Ketchikan rep has already told us we need to skip it, that people
          want/need hydo there and it's fishing season anyway - he doubts anyone will even show up
          to testify)

          Governor -



          Matt Zencey is asking how we feel about the legislative road shows. A commendable example
          of helpful public involvement or overkill designed to whip up pro-LNG or pro-Producer
          opposition to AGIA?? I say I stay positive and mention you will be attending as many as
          possible. Would you like to add anything?
