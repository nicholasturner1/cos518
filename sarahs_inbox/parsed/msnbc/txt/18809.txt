        He says " they " have now projected a $3-plus million loss of MatMaid , putting this "way
        above any losses with Murkowski ' s jet ", says Rydell.



        Again, unless we get out ahead on correcting MatMaid misinformation, this issue becomes
        the new proverbial bridge-to-nowhere, or becomes equivilant to Frank' s jet issue.



        The problem there is Alaskans will distrust that the Ag and MatMaid decisions we make are
        based on economics , and what ' s best for Alaska ... instead of being led to believe
        decisions are being made out of stubborness and emotion.

         Called Kristan and Ralph, neither one of them know where that number is

         coming from.      The financials are not completed yet. Can't reach Joe,

         but I've left him messages .          I'll work with Kristan on countering

         this ... asap.

        true we counter it asap and call him and AH on their bull.
