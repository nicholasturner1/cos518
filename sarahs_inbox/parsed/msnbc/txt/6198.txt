        Hello Governor,

        They are setting up an account at AX Cleaners (Anch.& Wasilla) under Governor's Office
        with you and Todd as signers. I'll let you know as soon as the paper work goes through.
        The House pays for the cleaners, so just have someone from the Anch. office send the
        receipts to me. Please note if any items on the receipt are not yours, so they are not
        inadvertently paid.

        Thank you,

        Erika
