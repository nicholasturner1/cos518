          Just caught him at home.



         He said the complaint did come from Lyda to John Glass who passed it to him.

             What are details of the report? Who, what, where, what was I supposedly driving, etc?

             Governor, Randy and I have been going over the report and its probably not something we want
             to have circulatedjust yet t will get a summary to you but if you need to respond to Walt just tell him it is
             still being reviewed.

             Governor-
             I st - Have you read/approved the 2007 AST Annual Report to be made public?

             2nd - Via a soon-to-be-retiring legislator, we have received a complaint that had you driving with Trig not in an
             approved infant car seat; if so this would be awkward in many ways.

             Please know that I am trying to help...
