              Subject : PERS/TRS liability bill

            I was listening to the testimony on SB 125 this morning and Governor Palin's re-appointment to the ARM Board,
            Larry Semmens, supports the governor 's plan for the pers/trs liability. His testimony followed Annette 's. Just and
            FYI.
