             Gov. Palin,



             I just want to congratulate you on the birth of your fifth child ..... I too have a child
             with Down Syndrome (now 13!) and want to let you know he is every bit a 13 year old as any
             other 13 year old boy!



             My husband and I helped establish the Down Syndrome Association of San Antonio 12 years
             ago, but it was all the parents that have followed us that have made it what it is today.
             There is so much work to be done... Welcome aboard on the most awesome and somewhat
             rollercoaster ride of your life...It is truly the most rewarding ever!!!!!!!!!!!!



            God bless,

            Patty Cade
