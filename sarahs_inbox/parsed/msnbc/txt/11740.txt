             If asked , remind folks it's outrageous to be accused of racism or personal insensitivity
             to the Native race. My husband is native, my kids are native, Frank needs to elaborate on
             names brought forth . And I did ask Sommerville to step aside.



             I'm syre Walt and Emil can testify...

             Brace yourself from an onslaught of criticism from the Native community. A tempest is
             brewing across the state about the Board of Game appointments .     The main beef: that
             there ' s no longer representation on the board from an Alaska Native subsistence user.

             This will bring you much ill will, especially from Rural lawmakers who are now preparing
             to wage war over the confirmation of these two appointments.
