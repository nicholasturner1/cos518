             MESSAGE:

             Honorable Governor Sarah Palin,

             First of all congradulations to the new addition to the honorable family.

             I am writing again regarding the appropriation of $4.8 million for the Chaninik Wind
             Group. It is now more important than ever to keep the appropriation in the budget. It is
             becoming more and more uncertain with the trend of the oil prices. It is good for the
             state of Alaska but for the end user in a rural village future looks very dismal. The
             intend of the Group was to team together to address the high energy cost. It is our hope
             that with your signature we can begin to move forward to address the high energy cost by
             harnessing the renewable resource (wind) that is readily available to us.

             I am very concerned about the trend of fuel oil price. It is going up with no end in
             sight. I will not be suprised if the price of oil reaches $200 per barrel by August.

             Pleasse help by keeping the $4.8 million in the Budget.

             Respectfully submitted,

            On Behalf of the 4 Villages Tuntutuliak,Kongiganak,Kwigillingok and Kipnuk
