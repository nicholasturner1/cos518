              announcement for me afterall. Hopefully he already worked with you guys on his change-of-
              mind about attending. Maybe we could get his grandma to attend? I think he wouldn't mind-

              This is an event that is in Fairbanks on the 26th of October, which would necessitate you
              staying up there another day/evening after your AFN speech on the 25th. Janice is working
              with Talis to attend on your behalf and I believe she has already regretted your
              attendance.
