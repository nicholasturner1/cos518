               Governor.

               A draft response to the Juneau Delegation 's letters (May 5 , May 20) on the energy situation in Juneau is
               attached. If the preference is to not respond , please disregard the draft. If the choice is to respond, please send
               edits to me . As enclosures I have the RCA letter orders and the Empire article citing June 8th as the estimated
               date for restoring hydro power.

               Thanks

               Randy
