            MESSAGE:

            Ms. Palin,



                      I'm a very strong supporter of your administration. I have been on Andrew
            Halcro's blog all week trying to get people to understand what a poor sport and loser he
            is. It drives me crazy that he can make a few accusations, and then all hell breaks loose.
            He is acting way to smug for my liking.



                     I don't think you owe anyone an apology for firing Walt M, No one asked you to
            explain your actions when you got elected and let people go, so you could bring your own
            people in. Why is it different now? Ok, so, I would really like to help in any way I can.
            I would love to be able to dig up some dirt on Andrew and throw it out to the public.



                   Stand strong, don't let him or the rest of his bunch get you down. Whatever you do,
            don't let Andrew force you into saying anything defensive. He wants you to slip up.



                   I am volunteering to help in any way I can....... I want this cat to shut up and go
            away as bad as you do.

               This is what we're trying to orchestrate via this afternoon's press avail at the house. Instead of a
               bunch of individual reporters hounding us all day. And what does Sean want to ask- remember
               Talis' advice on what can and can't be said re: personnel. Of course I want to and will speak with
               adn, but we need a time-effecient plan in place to allow me to do it. Thanks

               We'll just need a head count and a confirmed time... and an understanding if they're separate events or at the same time (I'm
               assuming press would be sep, perhaps before leggies... they're dying to know what we think and how we'll maneuver thru

               Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staffs part. Todd
               and I can serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify
               reporters if we're doing something separate with them. I'm getting out
               of the loop at this point, pls just let me know the progress when the
               coordination is complete. Thanks

               How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of
               them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote . We have
               made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!
                Either with or without leggies , I want to speak with press in a forum
               they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like
               the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.
