          Whatever you're most comfortable with. I apologize for assuming this was in the works many
          months ago. I thought Mike was working with you on finding a better solutions to the
          problems in Privileged or Personal N arena . Glad it will be taken care of by Wed anyway!



          Also, where are you in plugging in Privileged or9? I'm cc-ing Kris and Frank on this because
          they've been cognizant of both        ersonnel issues and I believe they've also assumed
          both Privlle ed replacement and Privileg employment were being addressed quite awhile ago.
          Thanks Leo!

        Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged        or Personal Material Redacted
        that the state thanks them for their service and now i



        What process are you, as COS , using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
        hands (I spoke with Emil about Privile yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
        Leo about Privle ed .. I'll cc them in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
        the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



        I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks' service has
        ended. If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
        overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better
                                                                             Privileged or Personal W
