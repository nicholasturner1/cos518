           Pls let me know where everyone is on this before i respond to mike. He has a different
           take on this than others. I'll see you in a bit and we can chat then. My luggage didnt
           make it, so i may have to try to track it down this AM and the airline had better deliver
           it to me - there's no time to go back to airport once northwest finds it. Bristol's made
           it tho!
