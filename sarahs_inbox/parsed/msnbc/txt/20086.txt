              Some of these questions have to go through Talis and Barnhill
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             And I on't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it, so please pass this email on
             to him before Sharon returns ADN's call. Thanks

             Governor-

             The Daily News wants to know if we have anything to say about Branchflower. Do you want me to
             say anything new or repeat that you are open to answer any questions?
