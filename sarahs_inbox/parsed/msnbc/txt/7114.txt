        Governor,



        The state travel regulations allow for payment of transportation costs,

        lodging and meal allowances for travelers while traveling on state

        business or for a state purpose. The state may pay for you and your

        family to attend to state business and various functions relating to

        your duties and responsibilities as Governor. Relocation costs for you

        and your family to Juneau at the onset of your term of office and your

        return home at the end of your term/s are also state payable expenses.



        As you noted, we paid for your family and the Parnell family to come to

        Juneau for the Governor's House Christmas Open House. We also paid

        costs related to both families being present at the swearing-in ceremony

        in Fairbanks.      Both functions are state functions that include family

        attendance.     I was advised that Track was not attending either function

        at that time. We also identified a January 5 Anchorage to Juneau trip

        on the King Air for you and your daughters 'move' to Juneau.



        It was never my intention to exclude Track from state paid travel, but I

        need a business purpose or function for each state paid trip in the same

        manner that we need a business purpose for state paid travel for the

        First Gentleman and your daughters. I assume Track will be included in

        family-related state paid events in the future. Unfortunately, when I

        was asked some time ago about Track's trip to Juneau I was told at the

        time that Track was not moving to Juneau, nor was there a state business

        function, event or purpose that would have allowed for state paid

        transportation for that specific trip.




                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0002006

         I apologize Governor that travel is an issue... please let me know if

        you would like to discuss this further or if I can provide any

        additional information.



        Linda
