            Good one liner addition. As long as it doesn't take longer or complicate matters (so we
            can get out asap), can you include those good stats below?

            Sorry for the computer glitch. The attachment of the draft in WORD may not have made it
            through this morning. Here is a slightly more polished version. I tried to put a few
            sentences in to remind readers the Privileged or Percnnal Material Redacted             71
