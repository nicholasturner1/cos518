              Governor,

              Kelly can give you further detail on this, but Senator McGuire is unable to attend the bill signing and has strongly
              requested/insisted that we hold off for another date . The bottom line is, we will not have a bill signing at the MOD
              walk.

              The plan the sponsors hope you'll adopt is to be the last speaker before the walk begins , offer brief remarks, and
              then lead the walk with two families (one of which is the Kolendo family from Wasilla ) who have received
              assistance from MOD . What I need to know from you is, would you like to only do the walk , or would you be
              willing to offer a few brief remarks , as well?
