          MESSAGE:

          The state takes my pfd every year due to the deliquint student loan, it was a total of
          about 12,000.00 after all the interest it hit upwards to 50,000.00, I have got it reduced
          to 8,800, and they have taken my pfd every year for the last 10 years, my concern is this
          additional money you are adding to the pfd, will this be taken by the state to go toward
          my loan? In my opinion they have got plenty of my money and yet they will not budge in
          forgiving any part of this loan even after all the money i paid and all the pfd's they
          continue to take, and yes I fill out the pfd every year with the knowledge that it will be
          taken, with the increase of everything from gas to food we buy the money that I make for
          my family just dont go as far as it used to, thanks for listening.




          Thank you, James J. Cross Sr.
