            Governor-



            The Institute of the North is working on an educational DVD project called "You Own
            Alaska". The producer, Marla Williams, sat next to you on a recent flight from Seattle.
            They are requesting a 30 minute interview with you on the issues of being good stewards of
            Alaska's resources, our responsibilities to ensure Alaska's future, and what it means to
            have a stake in Alaska. I will get questions in advance.



            They. would bring a team of four to Juneau and will likely have a lot of equipment to set
            up. They have requested 90 minutes to set up so I thought maybe we could shoot this at the
            mansion.  Erika and I could coordinate the set up so you would just have to show up for
            the interview.  I have talked with Janice and we could do this next Thursday. Please let
            me know.

                Representative Chenault,

                My neighbors and I are very disappointed to know that your office will not be forwarding
                our correspondence to you regarding our opposition to ADF&G proposal # 44823, the
                purchase of the Trujillo property on to the Governors office.

                This has gone beyond just keeping our neighborhood as it is. The health of the Kasilof
                River and its strong salmon runs are at stake . As you know the Kenai River has over
                crowding , destroyed habitat , aggressive power boaters (guides and private)
                hydrocarbon pollution , and boat motor noise pollution . And now the State wants to bring
                that to the Kasilof River.

                As your constituents my neighbors and I would like you to see to it that our voices are
                heard . Governor Palin will make the final decision on funding the proposal and we
                would like her to see how strongly we oppose it.

                Sincerely,

                Sandra Matthews

                Representative Mike Chenault 's Office

               Mr. Wright,

               I wanted to follow-up with our conversation this morning regarding a Lower Kasilof public access
               motorized boat launch , and would appreciate if Mr. Chenault would please send all copies of my
               correspondence with your office and yourself to Governor Palin. I would also like Mr. Chenault to send a
               letter of the concerns in his District regarding Fish and Games Proposal #44823 in SB256, to Governor
               Palin.

               I am aware that this project is in her capital budget and was placed there early in the process,
               before anyone in our community realized that this project was again in the budget , after being vetoed last
               year. We have sent numerous letters of concern regarding the process with which this project has been
               initiated and pushed through.
               Mr. Chenault is our District Representative and I feel that he should let Governor Palin know that, as of
               recently , we have been trying to get our concerns heard by all departments involved in this process. I
               understand that Mr . Chenault met with Fish and Game , but that does not subside my concerns , I would
               still like Mr. Chenault to address my concerns to the Governor in a letter from his constituents opposed to
               the funding of this proposal . I would like to see this proposal vetoed. Thank you for your time. Please
               see that Mr. Chenault also receives a copy of this correspondence.

               Sincerely,
