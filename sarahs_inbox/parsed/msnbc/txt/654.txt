  God Bless Governor Palin

  It is so refreshing to have a Governor that is not only fiscally responsible, but does not allow
  herself to be baffled by "the OldBoy" BS. Sarah Palin is a breathe of fresh air in Alaska
  Politics. God Bless her, and her integrity. May she continue to be as honest as she has
  shown herself to be since her election.

  And YES, right at this moment I am referring to the "Bridge to Nowhere".... but she has also
  proven her ability to see through other pork barrel scams perpetrated by our incumbent
  Thieves in DC.
