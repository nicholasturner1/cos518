             Who's " he"?    Mike?   He says he doesn 't know who would have leaked it.

             My two cents. . .the email looks like it was written with the possibility of disclosure in
             mind. It's very clean, communicates the message well that fits with who you are, but is
             also good for public consumption. That doesn't mean you did it, or even that he intended
             it that way--just that he took precautions knowing disclosure was possible. How's that for
             believing the best of someone?

             Dan Fagan is talking about this ...a letter being leaked from the Governor's office. I'm
             just not sure if he is talking about the leak to AJN or if it was also leaked to him too.

             Kyle called me to authenticate the email he received - I told him to

             $end what he received - which he did. I said - funny Kyle I don't see

             your name on the email string - he laughed and said he would not reveal

             his source.

             Sharon: Heartbreaking to know someone would have leaked my email this

             morning- Sunny said it had to have been sent to ADN within the first

             hour. I think it would do me good to ask Kyle how he received it - he

             won't tell me, but he'll know that I know how improper it is for

             internal emails to team members to be leaked to reporters.
