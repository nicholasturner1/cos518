               Exactly. John Katz thought that could have been emphasized more in the

               statement below and so I wanted to make sure Steve understood that.

               Just sent a clarifying message to Steve so that the translation isn't lost

               that this is the best proposal . Thanks.

             Good. It was a great meeting and an opportunity for the Governor to talk

              about the AGIA and to lay down her plans for the gasline. She emphasized

             that Alaska knows a natural gas pipeline is not only in the state's best

             interest, but in the nation's best interest as well. This was the first

             opportunity for Chairman Kelliher and Governor Palin to meet and discuss the

             AGIA. As you can see from the quote below, the Chairman believes that the

             Governor's proposal seems to be the best one to proceed and we're looking

             forward to working with FERC to bring Alaska ' s gas to market.




             Just so that you know. FERC does not officially endorse any one plan. It

             didn't with Murkowski's and won't for Palin's, but the strong words are very

             encouraging.




             We look forward to rolling out the AGIA Friday morning.

              Thanks Meg . We got News Channel to hook up with Sara this morning .               I guess

              it was before she went into the meeting .... but it was great that they made

              contact.

              Kelliher:



              "Today I met with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. We talked about her efforts on

              the Alaska natural gas pipeline, which I believe represent the best hope for

              building a pipeline to bring Alaska's vast natural gas resources to the

              energy-consuming lower 48 states.      The Commission looks forward to her

              efforts on the Alaska gasline being successful and we stand ready to help to

              the extent we can."
