             We wanted you to see the attached email and proposed ad from Defenders of Wildlife. As
             you will note , Defenders is contemplating a full blown advocacy campaign to foreclose
             aerial predator control of wolves and other animals if the purpose is to enhance game
             populations or sport hunting .  Their bill would foreclose such predator control in
             Alaska and in other states , such as Wyoming and Idaho , where the practice is now being
             discussed.

             If convenient ,    let's schedule a conference call for early this week .           Thanks.
