           I don't think they were really pushing it, only offering up the suggestion from Gene
           Dubay. I will have them send what they have this afternoon.

           Yep. I don't like the sterile enviro in the conf room but I really dislike idea of Enstar
           locale. Why would they have wanted it there?

           Enstar offered. And that is exactly what I mentioned, thus the controlled participation
           reference. Thinking more about it, it would probably be even better to have in your conf
           room to emphasize the involvement of the state in bringing this to fruition.

            Ummmm, that ' s Thayer and that other lobbyist . Why would they want it there? Enstar isn't
            the only company that could build the bullet line , is what they told me.

            Joe and Marty are inquiring about having it at Enstar as opposed to your conf room.
            They ' ll make sure to control the participation . Is that ok?
