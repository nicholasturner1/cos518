        take it from here.

        Kris,




        In a phone conversation with Malcolm this morning (he's in L.A.) he asked me

        to let you know that Governor Hickel and David Gottstein will be in Juneau

        all day May 1 and are prepared to testify before the House and Senate

        Finance Committees.        (I left messages for Representative Meyer and Senator

        Stedman on Tuesday morning but have had no replies.)




        FYI, Governor Hickel, Malcolm, and David will arrive in Juneau at 9:31 p.m.

        on Monday, April 30, and will leave to return to Anchorage at 7:47 p.m. on

        Tuesday, May 1. They have reservations at the Baranof Hotel.




        Yvonne
