                    Subject : Sunday editorial

                    In re-reading Sunday 's AGIA editorial, I see where it does say in one spot "...
                    even the governor admits the tax rate is too high. ..." That should have said, "...
                    even the administration admits the tax rate is too high. ..." It was based on my
                    interview with Patrick on Thursday, and the error (attributing it to the governor
                    instead of the administration ) came from writing the editorial while sitting in the
                    Juneau airport for two days last week and phoning in my corrections. We
                    changed the first reference two paragraphs earlier to "administration" but missed
                    the second reference (the copy editor on the other side of the phone
                    misunderstood my dictation of changes to the editorial).
                    Sorry for the misstated atribution.
                    Larry
