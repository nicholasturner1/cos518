            MESSAGE:

            Dearest Sarah,

                 Imagine my suprise when I found out that you had been elected to be the Governor of
            Alaska! Wow! It really is true that you've come a long way, baby. I hope you don't still
            hold a grudge for my editorial cartoons in the Frontiersman. Had I known you were running
            for Governor, believe it or not, I would've certainly offered my artistic services in your
            favor. You might think that I was more of an adversary but in reality, I was very pleased
            with you as the Mayor of Wasilla. The last Governor I knew personally, was Jay Hammond.

                 If anyone were to ask me if I felt YOU were qualified to be Alaska's Governor, I
            would have answered with a resounding yes. I just wanted to write you and tell you that I
            am delighted to hear of your successful bid for Governor and I hope you will remain as
                                                              1

             such for a very long time.

                   My most sincere wishes for your successful tenure.

             Sincerely,

                           Jim Bettis
