                Dear Governor,

                First of all thanks for the capital budget items. We had to have that to make this years
                construction come out right. Also thanks for coming to the port last Sunday for the tour
                with your family. We had over 250 people come on the first day. We plan to do this
                every Sunday through August. People were excited.

                If you have 30 minutes sometime soon I would like to talk to you about the gas line. I
                have been following the hearings and while I am not up to speed like I should be I have
                a couple of concerns and feel as a friend the need to talk to you about them. I'll call Kris
                and Mike Nizick to alert them. Thanks.
