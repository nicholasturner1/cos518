            Gov. Sarah Palin,



            I just wanted to write you and congratulate you on the birth of Trig. All children are
            special gift's from God and you have been blessed 5 times .  I am the mother of two young
            girl's, ages 3 and 7 months and feel as though I have been blessed beyond words.



            I did take maternity leave, the maximum allowed, and hope that you are able to find the
            time to sit back, and enjoy your new bundle.   I have only seen the picture of him that
            was in the Fairbanks Daily News Miner this morning, but he looks perfect. Enjoy!!!!l
