                Subject: Request by Metlakatla Indian Tribe to Expand Reservation Boundaries

              Governor.

              The Metlakatla Indian Community has asked the Secretary of the Interior to extend the boundaries of the Annette
              Islands Reserve to provide expanded fishing opportunities for its members . (The area they want to add to the
              reservation would run from the Southern point of Annette Island , south about 35-40 miles to the International
              Border of Canada and Alaska) This proposal will involve conflict with commercial and sport fishermen in
              Southeast Alaska waters , as well as with a petition for annexation of land and water to the Ketchikan Gateway
              Borough . It would also constitute a taking of State property (the waters and submerged lands ) for which
              compensation must be paid. Any expanded fishing opportunities for Metlakatla residents in the area of water they
              are seeking would come directly from other Alaskans currently participating in the state 's commercial and sport
              fisheries.
