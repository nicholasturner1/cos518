          If anyone has an answer, pis let me know asap:

          I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House
          offices to get emails from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my
          bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were the reasons given and
          responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it
          was that this occurred. Thank you
