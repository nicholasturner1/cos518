          I've been searching flights and if you do Alaska Airlines the cost is approx. $1,800. If
          you fly Northwest its considerably cheaper. We can put you out of ANC on Sunday or Monday
          depending on how long you want to be in NV.  I was just trying to fit in the King Salmon
          bill signing that I thought we were trying to look at beforehand. Janice

          into LV on Tuesday then departing for Philly on Weds . I would suggest a flight option that
          would get them in on Monday morning should they decide to go that route . Also AK flies
          direct there and it may be timelier and as cost effective to do . it that way...???
