              We'll know Barrow once we find out from Ethics what the price tag is to use someone else's
              plane.

               Have noted all changes to schedule for yesterday. We will need to know

               regarding the flights to Barrow as we will need to cancel the commercial

               one for today at 4:00 p.m. Thanks, Janice

                 1 talked to Linda and she does not know where her saying it was going to cost us came from. The answer
                 is what I gave you in the earlier message. If the Boro is offering their plane to you then its a gov to gov
                 arrangement and we just need to disclose it and nothing more.

                 Thank you for checking w Linda before we say yes be I don't want the state to get a $10,000 bill to get me up to

                 I believe that because it would be considered a government to government gift I think we just have to report it under
                 the ethics code. If there was some concern on the use of the plane as a gift to the state we could always reimburse
                 them for it, I don't think we have to reimburse them. As for the cost to the state if we were to reimburse for using it,
                 it would be calculated as a regular commercial fare per seat from Anchorage to Barrow. I will check with Linda and
                 if that changes I will let you know.

                 Did linda Perez say we'd have to pay for Barrow's Jet to be allowed seats on it tomorrow? How much will it cost the
                 state to reimburse them if we fly their aircraft?
