Sure, I'll do it right now. Ginger is stopping by to pick up flyers and will continue to work on ticket
sales. Unfortunately Paulette Simpson is out of town; she's on the same cruise as Romer Derr so
that group won't be back in town until Sunday.

Hi, Todd-



I'm happy to help with the fundraiser. Do you have a list of people who have already said they are
coming, so I don't ask someone twice? Do your friends here have lists that they're calling? To help,
i'll need all the info - start time, the food, etc. - how big's the TV? So if there's someone here who's
coordinating for you - just let me know and I'll get all that info from them.

My home number is Redacted or you can call my cell Redacted

Ken K.
