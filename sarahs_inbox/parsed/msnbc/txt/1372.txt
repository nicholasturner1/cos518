  Friends,
        Jay's efforts have evolved to a nice reward. Rhonda Mcbride and
  Todd Palin will be arriving on the Friday Anchorage flight at approximately
  3:00 p.m. We'll need to pick them up and facilitate a visit with Sidney first
  off. I need rooms for them and Ben, I'd ask that you help me figure the
  best in that regard. Ptarmigan Dorm, Birchwood Dorm, or make other
  arrangements; I see below:

  Friday
        Time                      Activity
 3:00 p.m.                 Arrival at Frontier
 3:15 p. m.                Spot their bags at Lodging choice

                                                                                 ROSTON 02466

     2) Designate a vehicle
     3) John Billings has volunteered to be the driver and guide

  Thanks everyone Jim
