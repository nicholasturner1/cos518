              Governor - The photographer of the stamp , Fred Hirschman from Wasilla will also be attending
              the event. They are very excited that you are attending and will put you in the top 15 minutes of
              the program as I have confirmed with them that you have approximately 30 minutes to attend.

              Monday, October 1 @ 1:00 - 1:30 p.m. Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DMVA) Opening
              Ceremonies - we have issued a Proclamation for them as they requested regarding victims of
              domestic violence . They would love you to do a stop by if it fits into your schedule in ANC. I
              have listed this on your calendar on Monday , 10.01.07 @ 1:00 p . m. as a Stop By if you so
              choose.

              On the other note: Anchorage Woman's Club Open Meeting on October 4 @ 11:30 a.m..
              Invitation was for you to speak regarding domestic violence and abuse to women . Request sent
              from Kandy Kizis, President of Anchorage Women's Club. This was regretted due to the chance
              that you would be attending an event in Juneau on Thursday. They were notified on Sept. 25
              directly by phone that you would be unavailable. I have confirmation that the Lt. Governor will be
              attending the event . Sean said that if you wanted to attend he would step aside . I have a call
              into Kandy regarding the newspaper piece. Thanks, Janice

             Aurora Borealis Stamp Release
             Monday, Oct. 1

             It's an honor to help celebrate today's release of the
             Aurora Borealis single stamp from the Polar Lights

            11/10/2009

                                                                                                                   P RAGS P01 _0006069

                collection. Thank you all - especially Kathy Loera and
                Kathy Phillips - for inviting me to join you!

                We are so blessed to live in this incredible state where
                we get to see the Northern Lights in real life - not just on
                a stamp!.

                But I'm delighted to see that Aurora Borealis, a
                phenomenon so closely tied to Alaska, is on a stamp that
                celebrates the tradition of this International Polar Year
                2007-2008.

               This is the fourth time over the past 125 years that
               scientists from around the world are banding together to
               organize scientific and exploration programs
               concentrated in the Polar Regions.

               Each polar year has been a hallmark of international
               cooperation in science achievement - from the first polar
               year in 1882 that included research at Point Barrow - to
               the 1932 research that established 40 permanent Arctic
               research stations - to the 1957 research that confirmed
               continental drift and discovered the Van Allen Radiation
               Belt encircling the Earth.

               This Aurora Borealis single stamp was part of the
               International Polar Year souvenir sheet issued jointly on
               Feb. 21 by eight countries: the United States, Canada,
               Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and
               Sweden.

              It's also an honor to recognize our postal workers here
              with us and throughout Alaska. You continue the tradition
              established when John H. Kinkead (kin-kade) was named
              the first postmaster general of Alaska - at Sitka in 1867.

              The words on the front of the U.S. Postal Service building
              in New York pretty much describe delivering mail in
              Alaska - "Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of
              night stays these couriers from the swift completion of
              their appointed rounds."

              Congratulations on the issue of this single stamp - and
              for the hard work that you do every day in our
              challenging environment!
