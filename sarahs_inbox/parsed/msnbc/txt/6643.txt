             Subject : Larry Persily/DC Governor's Office
             I am pleased to let you know that Larry Persily has accepted the Palin
             administration's offer of employment in the DC office. He will start in
             about three (3) weeks.

             I am quite excited. I won't say it publicly, but I think that Larry, in
             conjunction with Sam Bishop, Allison Nyholm, and our support staff, gives us
             the best team we've had in my time here. Alaska is facing some significant
             challenges in DC, and the new group, along with our colleagues in Alaska,
             helps provide the capacity to prevail.

            Thanks very much for working with me to recruit Larry and Sam. Meg, Larry
            and I would like to work with you on a press release, as was the case with
            your release announcing Sam's appointment.


            Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
