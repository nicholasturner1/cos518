            I know the gas team will work on this over the remainder of the weekend but I am working
            on my Fairbanks speech now and am thinking of ways to combat this ... I can't wait for them
            as.I'm running out of prep time for Tuesday except to incorporate whatever they suggest
            about Conoco as best I can at the last minute.
