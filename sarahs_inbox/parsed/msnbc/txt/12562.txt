                Subject: City of Eagle Road Improvements and Dust Control

              Governor:

              Commissioner Von Scheben is pressing a bit to move ahead and go out to bid on the road improvements and
              dust control work for the project in Eagle. The funding numbers he gave me for the project are: $1 ,182,000
              Denali Commission and $117,000 DOT. He also says that based on the petitions signed by City Council
              members, etc., there is more support in the community to move ahead with the project than against it, although
              some members of the minority opposed to the project are very vocal and get some media attention.

              Thanks,

              Randy
