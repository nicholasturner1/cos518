            Governor,

            I have attached DOT's draft press release that has now been edited by Larry Persily. It appears to me to be for
            Alaska media. Randy just returned from DOT and I told him I want to finalize the plan for Gravina today
            including press advisory , confirmed date and message for national audience , communication to local legislators
            and press release.

            Mike

             John & Larry,
             Attached is draft that DOT is kicking around. I'm suspecting/hoping that it has been run through your office by
             now.
             I've CC'd Randy so he can run point for the gov's office on this issue . I know he planned to call you and
             MacKinnon regarding this issue soon.
             A quick background would best be saved for a phone conversation . Suffice to say, I'm not comfortable with DOT
             generating drafts and I never asked for them to provide one. They are being "helpful."
             Russ
