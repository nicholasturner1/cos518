          Thanks.  In a way I can not believe the membership disregarded the union leadership in
          urging them to vote no. The union leadership ads were a bit ugly. Thankfully the members
          recognized the generous nature of our 10% increase over 3 years as a commitment and step
          forward to help our recruitment and retention problem.

          This just in...




                 The ASEA Election Committee conducted a count of the CNC
                                                                   1

           Advisory Vote on June 20th and 21st.




                  The results are as follows:




                  Yes------ 1555




                  No------- 1451



           Thus, ASEA members have indicated their support for our last contract

           proposal of 4%, 3%, 3%. Their union leadership should sign a tentative

           agreement soon and the Dept. of Administration is hoping to get a

           release out by tomorrow.

           Governor and Commissioner,



           I have not heard anything new leading up to the special session. I

          concur with Commissioner Jackson regarding SB 4 as the vehicle. However,

           there may be other considerations that may come in to play with this

           legislation that I am sure Bit has covered.

          Governor,




          I haven't heard anything new and at this point still expect         SB4 by Sen.

          Olsen will be the vehicle used to pass a Senior benefit bill.           What I am

           hearing from seniors is that they are monitoring this special session

           closely and will keep Legislators honest about doing the right thing for

           the

           right reason , and getting the work done that they didn't finish before

           the

           regular session ended.         And , I'm still hearing one day to do this work,



           though Tibbles and Bitney may have more info to share.




           Should be an interesting session!

           Hi Karleen - can you think of anything I'd need to be ready for next wk's

           special session ? Has anyone heard concretely what legislators will

           propose

          I see Cab mtg is on sched for next week, but unless someone has added it

          unbeknownst to me, I still say we covered enough last wk and we'll skip

          this

          one, so it can be removed from sched. Thanks
