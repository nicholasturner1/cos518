             Gentlemen , just for your awareness. This is the latest which we have on the developments regarding the
             Western Alaska fall seastorm event that is going on. Kivalina voluntarily evacuated 97 residents to Kotzebue last
             night. Again this was voluntary by the community as a precaution . We also have been told that an additional 100
             drove by ATV's to Red Dog and were put up in their facilities . We are in contact with the NW Arctic Borough
             EOC. They have not indicated that there are any emergency threats at this time . That are in constant contact
             with all of the villages that have the potential to be impacted . I have asked for an update on a every 3 hour basis
             until we are through the projected storm event . Last word was that the peak of the storm would be early morning
             hours today. As information is made available to me I will make certain to pass that along . If you wish to discuss
             further I am available as you wish.

             We are "Ready to Serve"

              More than 18 months have passed since Rene Preval was overwhelmingly elected president of Haiti in what
              many regional analysts considered one of the country's most crucial elections in decades. Within a period of
              only six years, Haitians had experienced a number of tumultuous events. It started with President Jean-
              Bertrand Aristide's chaotic second term, in which international aid was suspended mainly due to accusations
              of election fraud surrounding his 2000 victory. Shortly thereafter, the 2004 coup d'etat designed to oust
              Aristide and his government, led to two wasted years under the unstable government of Interim-Prime
              Minister Gerard Latortue and President Boniface Alexandre, whose accomplishments were meager at best. In
              short, Haiti was in desperate need of an effective and democratically elected leader who would govern fairly
              and help inch the poverty-stricken state out of its traditional despair. Expectations were large, and it was
              Preval, in his second stint as president, who was expected to deliver on some, if not all, of those expectations
              beginning in February 2006.
