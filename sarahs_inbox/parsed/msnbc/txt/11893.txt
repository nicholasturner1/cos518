             MESSAGE:

             Gov. Palin,



              Since the Army has announced it needs to shut down the MAST service at FWW due to mission
             requirements in Iraq/Afghanistan, why not have the Air Guards Pararescue detachment at
             Eielson AFB , take over the mission?
