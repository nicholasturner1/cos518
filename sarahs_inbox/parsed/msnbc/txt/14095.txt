            This is an important bill to see movement on so Alaskans get a piece of the surplus
            revenue that legislators will spend in the near future unless we distribute it to
            residents first.

            Where is HB396? If they don't allow one of the many forms of energy/surplus dividends this
            session, I'm afraid it will be too easy for them to cont to hold on to the surplus (and
            ultimately spend it), instead of giving back to Alaskans - the resource owners. Which
            legislator(s) controls these measures that could succeed in giving more of the surplus to
            residents instead of govt?

           The House and Senate are both going into sessio at 2 PM. I think much is happening this
           morning.  They usually leave enough time for folks to go to morning church.

            I have heard that the Legislature may get done one day early (Sat). I do not see how the
            Senate can leave on friday at this point. They need to concur on the capital budget
            otherwise they are accepting that all our projects including the roads, oil and gas, etc.
            are not needed. If the House put the final capital budget on the floor wed/thurs, sat
            seems possible.



            I plan on trying to get a total spending spreadsheet from Meyer today. It will help our
            discussions with the House.

            Hi guys: do you know what time Hse or Senate meets today? Wondering if I should get things
            done around here before heading over to the office.



            Nice editorial in the ADN today, pointing out the posturing of leggies re: Sp Session and
            their request for expanded call.



            Talked to a reporter on Friday's return flt to Juneau - he said he's hearing Senate
            intends to gavel out on Friday, with or without House's completion of work. Does that mean
            the House finishes up when they need to, and it's an assumed concurrence by the Senate on
            the final product then?
