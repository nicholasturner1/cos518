I'm going to sumbit my APOC disclosure forms asap, they're due in a few days, so I'll need the
camapign-recived gift list that discloses those items worth (whatever the amount it)... I believe it's
held in both the Anchorage and Juneau offices?



Also, Todd- what's the # for SmithBarney so I can get a list of all your 401 K plan holdings. And did
Bristol and Willow get paid for comm fishing in '07? How much? And who were the fish buyers last
season? And no changes in properties bought/sold last year, correct? The buying/selling took place
in '06, 1 believe? And legally Deb Richter's name is off the cabin property, correct?



Thanks
