               Just sent a clarifying message to Steve so that the translation isn't lost

               that this is the best proposal. Thanks.

               Good. It was a great meeting and an opportunity for the Governor to talk

              about the AGIA and to lay down her plans for the gasline. She emphasized
                                                                        1

               that Alaska knows a natural gas pipeline is not only in the state's best

               interest, but in the nation's best interest as well. This was the first

               opportunity for Chairman Kelliher and Governor Palin to meet and discuss the

               AGIA. As you can see from the quote below, the Chairman believes that the

               Governor's proposal seems to be the best one to proceed and we're looking

               forward to working with FERC to bring Alaska's gas to market.




               Just so that you know. FERC does not officially endorse any one plan. It

               didn't with Murkowski's and won't for Palin's, but the strong words are very

               encouraging.




               We look forward to rolling out the AGIA Friday morning.

             Statement of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Joseph T.

             Kelliher:



             "Today I met with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. We talked about her efforts on

             the Alaska natural gas pipeline, which I believe represent the best hope for

             building a pipeline to bring Alaska's vast natural gas resources to the

             energy-consuming lower 48 states.    The Commission looks forward to her

             efforts on the Alaska gasline being successful and we stand ready to help to

             the extent we can."
