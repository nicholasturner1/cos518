          Shoot! Its a great piece. Alaskans need to be reminded of all the pts you were making.



          I just taped this week's AGIA update - maybe next wk we can tape one together, or just you
          alone. I know Alaskans want to hear more of your perspective on the issue. We could turn
          your op ed into the weekly briefing. Your pta re: private sector project needs to be
          heard.

          Subject: ADN & my Compass piece



          The ADN spoke with Kate today and told her they didn't know when they would schedule my
          Compass piece to run or if they would. They did the "We're so backed up from the
          election..." routine. Not a good sign.
