             Sorry I'm having to send this from personal email, but I can't log into the State system right now.

             Attached is tomorrow's memo for the Alaska Conservation Alliance meeting in the morning. I
             will be in the office if you'd like to go over any of this ahead of the meeting.

                 2007 Fire Conference

                 Valdez , Alaska

             Dear Governor Palin,

             I would like to invite you to the 2007 Fire Conference here in Valdez Alaska on September 24-29th. We
             are expecting over 300 firefighters and Chiefs from all over the state.

             I have asked previously that you open the conference on Wednesday the 26th . It would be our honor to
             have you open our conference . Most of the firefighters that attend this conference are volunteers and
             dedicate hundreds of hours keeping our state safe.

             We all know you have a very busy schedule and have to attend many functions . The conference has
             asked each year that the governor attend the opening ceremonies . Over the past few years we have had
             the Lt Governor step in for you to address the conference. If you can not make the Wednesday opening
             ceremonies can you check your schedule for the banquet on the 29th? Our banquet honors firefighters
             and Chiefs that have accomplished good deeds and award excellence in the job.

             I would also like to thank you for signing into law the safe cigarette act . This will save lives and property
             for Alaskans into the future.

            If your staff can please put September 26th (Wednesday ) at 8:30 am for the opening ceremonies and/or
            September 29th (Saturday ) at 6:30 pm for the closing ceremonies and awards I would appreciate your
            appearance along with the 300 plus firefighters if at all possible . I did get the letter welcoming the
            attendees and that letter will be in the booklet for all attendees to see.

            Sincerely,

            George R Keeney

            Chief
