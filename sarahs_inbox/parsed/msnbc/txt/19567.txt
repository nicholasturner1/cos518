               I do choose to support this, if for no other reason to prove we're willing to take on the strict
               oversight of anwr development - the question of environmental oversight has been an issue with
               the naysayers. Thanks

               Congressman Ralph Hall (Republican, Texas) = called this morning to seek your support for
               draft legislation (pasted = below) that would convey the Coastal Plain of ANWR to the State of
               Alaska = in order to facilitate oil and gas development there. The Congressman is working
               closely with Congressman Young = on the bill and says that he has discussed it personally with
               President = Bush, who would sign the legislation if it gets to his desk. =

               I was non-committal pending this communicat= ion to you. There is no question that the Palin
               administration = supports responsible oil and gas development in the Coastal Plain.&nbs= p:

              The legislation would also require a 50/50 = revenue share between the State and federal governments
              and would impose a = prohibition on oil exports . With the exception of a = few Alaskans , most people

              Recommendation: I don't know whether the following would be completely = acceptable to Mr. Hall,
              but I would recommend the statement below in = response -
