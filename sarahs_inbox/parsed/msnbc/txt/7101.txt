         I was thinking I would contact IPrivileaed or Personal and / or P rivile g ed to see if either
         would be interested in filling the ob/gyn vacancy on the Board of Direct Entry Midwives.
         I wanted to check with you first incase you know either of them.

         Both (Privileged or Personal) and LPrivileged or Personals have worked with the DE midwives out here in
         the Valley - one of them might be interested.

          I'm writing today to solicit your advice regarding the Board of Direct Entry Midwives.
          Dr. Richey from Anchorage recently termed out and we are searching for a replacement for
          him.  Can you think of any good candidates to recommend to fill this vacancy?




          Thank you for your time,
