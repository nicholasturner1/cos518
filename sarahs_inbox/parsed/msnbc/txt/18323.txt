         John may have even called himself. Heather and Randy have both accepted. I am working on
         start dates for them (soon as possible). Russ will start transitioning this week and I
         have been thinking about bringing him to anchorage with me to start some discussions with
         legislators on PPT.  This is all based on the team's completion of the models and geting
         back to you for an update.

         already got in the 'Ear.



         Sheeeesh- I can trust people in this business as far as I can throw them. Have the two
         even been officially offered, and accepted, the jobs yet?



        Reading the 'Ear today was another lesson for me that nothing is considered confidential
        to some folks, so fewer and fewer people should be brought in to "think out loud" re:
        admin business.
