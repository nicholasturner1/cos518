           Rosanne: can you do this- Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:

           No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with
           the video Andy and Jason took great effort to make, where I'm saying "rah rah" in support
           of the participants... and my husband took TWO DAYS of his slammed schedule to judge the
           pageant even!!! He left commercial fishing early to keep his.committment to judge the
           thing!!!  (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so
           no, I didn't make it in person, I was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to
           fairbanks to meet with seven members of the US Congress on ANWR, but... Sheeeesh- can
           folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of support" on something. Argggggh!

              You know, I think I'll do my own letter of correction on this one.
