                 Here is a short starting point list of what Joy Fowlin of PBS' To The Contrary plans to
                 ask during your interview tomorrow:

                 Questions for Gov. Palin

                   1. Alaska is known for being a kind of macho state, why do you think they elected
                      both a woman governor and US Senator?
                   2. How do you balance your duties as governor and raise four kids at the same time?
                   3. Your son enlisted in the Army on September 11th of last year . How has his
                      decision influenced the way you feel about the war in Iraq?
                   4. What do you want to leave this position accomplishing ? What changes do you
                      want to see happen in Alaska to help out families?
                   5. Your name has been thrown out there for VP. Do you have aspirations to be in
                      the national spotlight?
