               Governor,
               The steaks are in the freezer wrapped in white butcher paper . Would you like to have a few grilled for tonight?
               Diane thought of making sugar-free jello in the shape of hearts for Piper 's class- we'll plan on that unless we hear
               otherwise.
               Thanks,
               Erika
