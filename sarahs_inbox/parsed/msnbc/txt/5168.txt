                Kenai Superior Court: Anna Moran, Arthur "Chuck" Robinson
                Bethel Superior Court: R. Poke Haffner, Marvin Charles Hamilton III

               It's typical that initial phone conversations are conducted by Boards and Commissions, and the face to face
               interviews take place with the chief of staff and governor. They term out at 70 yrs old so it's understandable that
               they would go through as long a vetting process as you see appropriate. I'm open to whatever you both feel
               comfortable with.

                 Within 45 days of the Governor 's office receiving the names . We received them January 19 so the date
                 they are to be decided is March 5. I've solicited a lot of good info and done a lot of background work on
                 all of the nominations. I'll wait for you guys to decide how and when you want to hold the interviews.
