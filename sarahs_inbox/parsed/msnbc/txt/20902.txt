          Quick clarification.   I did have Nizich already talk to Leo so yesterday was not the first
          discussion.  I actually went over to see him about Privileged a, workload and current DOT
          structure.  When he mentiond Prlvile ed 0 name I stre se now a needs to move asap. He will
          flying in this week and will addressing these issues as soon as he gets here (which I
          believe is tues night or wed morning).

          Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing lPrivileged or Personal Material Redacted AIDEA
          that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time (it's overdue) to move on.



          What process are you, as COS, using to accomplish              this? Should I put it in commissioners'
          hands (I spoke with Emil about Privlle a Yesterday             and you told me you've already spoken with
          Leo about Privileged o.. I'll cc t em in this note             so they're prepared if they have to make
          the notifications), should I contact them myself,              or have you already contacted them?



          I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks' service has
          ended. If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
          overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Ma
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
