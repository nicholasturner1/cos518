MESSAGE:

I heard through a Down syndrome yahoo group that you have been blessed with a baby with Down
syndrome. I have an 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome and she is the light of my life. You
will experience life with an intensity of feeling as few ever do. You will also experience many more
miracles, smiles and tears and an immeasurable "joy" as your son shows you the truly important
things in life. Congratulations to you and your family.
