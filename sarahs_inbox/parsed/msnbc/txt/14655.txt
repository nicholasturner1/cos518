            if press needs to grab me for statement on whatever Bowles is announcing today they can
            catch me at Sheraton - noon - Nurses Appreciation function. Or after that at Click's DOL
            graduation thing in Palmer. Or spring concert tonight in the Valley.



            And pls let me know what they announced.
