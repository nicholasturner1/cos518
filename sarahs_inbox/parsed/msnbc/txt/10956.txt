              I checked my Birchwood Community Ch. speech which was 3802 words and I delivered it in
              roughly 23 minutes. I don't think I skipped any major sections.



              Before wacking too much more out of your speech :) let's make sure how long it will really
              take. If you don't have time, I'll do a run through with it this evening to see where we
              are.
