               Hello ... just thought I would let you know that I just heard some very nice comments about Governor Palin and
               her new baby on KLove , a national Christian radio station . O They have a link to the Anchorage Daily News
               article on their website, but the DJs were talking about the statement that Governor Palin released about their
               child being a gift from God. I believe the statement made on -air was , "what an awesome Governor the state of
               Alaska has!"

               Just thought I would share. 9
