           Oh amen!  That's what I was thinking while he spoke! Let's be thinking of what we can do.
           And I sat next to John Havelock- I told him you speak highly of him, he offered to help in
           any way we'd ever need him.

           Dear governor palin.  If you are at the Stewart memorial during Byron mallots comments.
           There is an opportunity to make a good gesture based on his observation that Stewart
           wished to incorporate recogntion of native Alaskans in the state seal and or preamble.
           Maybe we can do something about the seal? Talis.
