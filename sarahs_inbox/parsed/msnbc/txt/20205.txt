               In summary, this last one requests the name/address of any person known by you or your staff to have
               knowledge of relevant facts regarding firing of Monegan and any documentation , emails, etc regarding same.

               First one acknowledges Nizich 's letter and scheduling a meeting . The other one requests a memo from law
               explaining legal basis for Governor's action.
