                  Dear Governor Palin-

                  I am writing you to express my support for an addition of $1 million in funding for the University of
                  Alaska' s budget for the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences program aimed at preparing Alaskans
                  for jobs and careers in the fishing industry and fisheries management.

                  It is my understanding that this funding will be used as matching funds to leverage an additional $5 million
                  in private grant funds . I believe this would be money well-spent to improve the quality of fisheries related
                  programs the University provides as well as increasing the number of Alaskans prepared to manage the
                  fisheries that are so important to this state.

                 I might also mention that in the reauthorized MSA there is a new provision (Section 109) that among other
                 things is focused on improving education and training on marine resource professions among coastal
                 community residents of Alaska and Hawaii. The Section is much more detailed and I can provide you
                 with exact language if you like. The main point I wanted to make though , is that funding this program will
                 go a long ways toward the University to start "filling the pipeline " with Alaskans who are prepared and
                 qualified to enter marine resource professions.

                 In closing I ask that the request by the University of Alaska for $ 1 million for fisheries be funded in full.

                 Sincerely,
                 Eric Olson
