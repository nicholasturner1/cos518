                Thanks Governor. it's an interesting approach that I like. Plus, we don't even need the whole 19 million
                acre reserve, just 2, 000 acres where the oil is and enough to get it out of the reserve . Amazing that
                democrats in Congress will call for steps like not adding small amounts of oil to the strategic reserve and
                tout that as helpful to the energy crisis but then complain the million barrels a day in oil and trillions of
                cubic feet of natural gas in ANWR isn't enough to help the nation.

                I'll be in Anchorage today and tomorrow meeting with Chuck Kopp to discuss steps we can take on crime
                in rural Alaska and improving recruiting etc. There are several things Walt didn 't really seem to work hard
                on or want to do , like recruiting from returning National Guard and military , or finding ways to improve our
                local option laws and cracking down on bootlegging that could be helpful. I will pass these ideas on to
                Chuck and mention the recruiting ideas to Joe Schmidt for DOC to consider.

               Fyi- congressman hall from texas is introducing a bill that would transfer ownership of ANWR from the
               feds to the state. I'm on record supporting the idea and his bill. It may be an interesting subject for
               alaskans to hear about. I've promised expedited development if the transfer were ever to take place.

                 Subject: Congressman Boehner/Alaska Energy Provisions


                According to news articles, Minority Leader Boehner supports the Alaska provisions in the energy legislation
                proposed yesterday by House Democrats. While this bill was defeated on the suspension calendar, which
                requires a 2/3rds vote for approval, the Alaska provisions (discussed in my email yesterday) could come up
                again in some other context.

                Accordingly, if possible, I would suggest that you talk with Mr. Boehner during his Alaska visit this weekend. In
                my opinion, he is inadvertently failing into the Democrats' trap. Their proposal, and not just the use it or loose
     i          it feature, is much more rhetorical than real. In general, I believe that the Alaska provisions add little to existing
                law and, in some cases (ban on oil exports) are actually deleterious.

                If Mr. Boehner knows the facts, which I will be providing to his staff today, he might change his mind.
                This could also help with some of the 26 House Republicans and a few oil state Democrats who voted in favor of
                Speaker Pelosi's legislation.

                Several of our concerns are also discussed in a Statement of Administration Policy issued yesterday by the Bush
                Administration. I have pasted the statement below so that you can see the Administration's problems with the
                NPR-A and gas pipeline provisions, as well as with the ban on Alaska oil exports.

                Hope this helps.

               EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
               OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET
               WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503
               July 17, 2008 (House)
               STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
               H.R. 6515 - To amend the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 and for other purposes
               (Rep. Rahall (D) WV)
               The Administration strongly opposes H.R.6515, which fails to address the pressing energy needs of our Nation.
               Instead, the bill would discourage the development of domestic energy resources, drive up gasoline prices, and
               reduce the Nation's energy security. With gasoline prices at historic highs, it is unimaginable that Congress is
               considering legislation that would, among other things, reduce domestic oil supply by chilling investment and
               placing new restrictions on how exploration can go forward. If H.R. 6515 were presented to the President, his
               senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.
               This legislation is another example of the Democratically controlled Congress' failure to address the root causes
               of high gasoline prices. The President has put forward a combination of Federal policies to access our domestic
               resources, break our dependence on fossil fuels, improve our energy efficiency, and harness the power of
               alternative fuels and renewable energy technologies
               - while at the same time increasing our energy security and ensuring our economy.can continue to prosper and
               grow.
               On Monday, July 14, the President lifted an executive prohibition on drilling for oil and natural gas on the Outer
               Continental Shelf and urged Congress to remove a similar legislative barrier. The President has repeatedly called
               on Congress to take additional measures to address the Nation's energy needs including: (1) removing the
               prohibition on completing commercial oil shale leasing regulations to allow access to this promising resource; (2)
               permitting oil and gas exploration and development in a remote region of Northern Alaska; and (3) streamlining
               the permitting process for expansions and reconfigurations of refineries. In lieu of the current flawed piece of

               legislation, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to take action in these areas.
               The bill prohibits the granting of new oil or gas exploration or production leases to any entity that is not
               "diligently developing" its existing leases on Federal lands. Current law already establishes initial lease periods
               and requires that reasonable progress be made toward production of resources from Federal oil and gas leases.
               Failure to demonstrate and maintain progress toward commencing production already results in the forfeiture of
               the lease and any extensions , as well as the lessee's investment in it.
               By blocking some firms from competing for new leases, this legislation would further increase gasoline prices
               that already exceed $4 per gallon and result in unintended consequences due to litigation. Even though new
               leases will take years to develop, oil markets are forward -looking, and an expected decline in future supply will
               raise prices today.
               This bill mandates additional oil and gas leasing sales within the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A).
               This mandate is misplaced, as regular lease sales are already occurring. The key impediment to increasing
               production from NPR-A is the near continuous legal challenges to Federal lease sales in Alaska -lawsuits that
               would just as surely prevent any meaningful progress intended by the bill's mandates . The Administration urges
               Congress to address this key impediment, and thereby have a real positive impact on production.
               This bill seeks to expedite construction of pipelines in Alaska for oil and natural gas. The Administration is willing
               to help expedite any Federal permits needed to facilitate construction of such pipelines. However, the
               Administration would oppose any requirement for further Federal funding or financial support for these
               pipelines, as there are sufficient market incentives for their development. In particular, the Administration would
               strongly oppose any additional Federal financial incentives beyond the already authorized $18 billion in Federal
               loan guarantees . If Congress really wants to have a positive impact on production in Alaska, they should allow
               more production in the area of Alaska 's National Wildlife Refuge that was set aside for oil and gas exploration.
               Finally, this bill requires that Alaskan oil production supply only U.S. markets . Such a ban on the export of
               Alaskan oil is unnecessary and unwise. None of the oil production from the North Slope of Alaska is sold beyond
               Alaska and the Lower-48 States. The U.S. Congress did pass a law in 1995 permitting exports, but virtually no
               oil has been exported for the past eight years. Such a ban would make virtually no additional oil available to
               U.S. consumers, and would not lower oil prices that are set in a world market . At the same time, such export
               restrictions are detrimental to the efficient operation of global energy markets and would send the wrong signal
               to our trading partners who may face pressure to impose similar trade restrictions.
