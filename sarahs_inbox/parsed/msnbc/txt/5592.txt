          He's tough to get ahold of, and more power to him for that!

          Governor,

          I received a call from Rick Halford, who was calling from Dillingham,

          and in and out of Alegnagik. Rick was asking if he needs to plan on any

          further discussions with you, or a trip to Juneau. He intends to call

          me back later today since he cannot always be reached on his cell

          phone.     If you would like to talk with him directly I could redirect him

          to you.



          Also, I know the Legislative leadership is meeting with you on Monday

          morning, although I am not sure if it is focused on AGIA, solely, or

          not.     Do you want Pat, Tom or me to attend this meeting? Please feel

          free to say no, but I need to ask as various legislators are broaching

          the meeting with us.

                                                             2




                                                                                                        PRA_GSP01_0001359
