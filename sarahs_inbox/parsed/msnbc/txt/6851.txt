           Mark wants to accept the position. He'd work in the Valley office a few days a week and in Anchorage two days.
           His primary functions would be constituent relations (in more of an outreach capacity) and communications.
           Colleen would work out of the Anchorage office. I have a mtg. w/Colleen (requested by her) tomorrow morning.

           He would like to give one month notice. After which he needs to go back east for a week. So, we'd be looking at
           early June. Meg is okay with that.

           Please advise before I proceed any further.
