               NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams is interested in a one-on-one interview with you about Exxon Valdez.
               I suggested right after tomorrow 's Exxon Valdez news conference.

               It would be 10- 15 minutes.

               If you would like to do this, Sharon can give the producer a call and make the arrangements.
