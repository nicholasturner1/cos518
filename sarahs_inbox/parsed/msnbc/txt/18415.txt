           Governor, sorry I can't be there tonight. I really want to go home to be with Sharon, but I am available to help by
           telephone anytime I am needed.

           Since we all really care so much about doing things right, I wanted to encourage you to know that I am certain you
           will make the right choice about next Tuesday's announcement. I have been praying very much for you to have
           wisdom and we both know its in the "plan". God bless Tom

           Dear Ms. Smith:

           Governor Palin asked me to respond to your email regarding the FY2008 budget for the State
           of Alaska. As you know, Governor Palin recently signed the operating and capital budgets
           with approximately $231 million in reductions through line-item veto.

           The Governor's budget goals have been very clear: to slow the growth of government, live
           within our means, and save for the future. The Governor's budget promotes a strong
           economy, world-class education, safer communities, and a solid infrastructure. This budget
           prioritizes state spending, makes substantial investments in core services, and saves for
           future.

           Public participation is an essential element of budget development. Thank you for taking the
           time to comment on the budget.

           Sincerely,
           Karen J. Rehfeld, Director
           Office of Management and Budget

           Please do not veto the appropriations to Chugach Electric
           and Municipal Light and Power for work on Fire Island. This
           is vital and important for Alaska 's energy future.

           Our oil and gas will not last forever. The increased price of
           oil will provide Alaska with more money , but Enstar is
           increasing its rates to Alaskans now. It is critical that we
           diversify our energy resources by investing in renewable
           resources. This will create one source for long term stable
           electricity costs. Once the Fire Island Wind Farm project is
           complete, prices will not go up . In this way it is like a
           hydroelectric project.

           I am oppossed to the $ 1.4 million going to ChangePoint for
           the indoor sport facility. Please consider a veto of this
           project. ChangePoint already got a "great deal". The state
           should not provide them with any additional financial
           support. It appears very inappropriate for Rep . Kevin Meyer
           to direct Alaska money to his church sponsored facility.

           Thank you for considering my comments.
