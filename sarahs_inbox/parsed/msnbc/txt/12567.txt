               Hey governor,



              The next time you're talking w pip, ask her why she's looking forward to growing up or
              becoming a woman. I'm going to plug her answer into some short opening remarks for you for
              the women's history luncheon. I'm sure whatever her answer is will get the crowd laughing.
              Fyi, you're opening remarks are optional. I just want to make sure you have 'em if you
              need 'em.

              Hope you're having a great weekendi
