             MESSAGE:

             I just saw the Glenn Beck piece on the birth of your son.  We are from the Pacific
             Northwest, but my wife and I lived in Anchorage in 1986 and 1987. Our first son, Trevor
             was born on May 25, 1991 and has Trisomy 21. After successful open heart surgery at 3
             months, he has been healthy and will turn 17 next month. He is a challenge and a blessing
             to all that know him. But aren't we all.




             We wish you the best with the new addition to your family.



             Sincerely,



             Steve & KaLyn Harding

            Merdian, Idaho
