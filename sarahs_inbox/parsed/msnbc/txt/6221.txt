          I'll be in juneau tomorrow, perhaps also having to put to rest rumors that the capitol's
          moving. Nothing has changed in all these yrs I've supported accessability to lawmakers and
          even campaigned on the notion that conducting meetings and even on on special session
          along the road system really isnt such a bad idea. I got elected despite my position on
          that! But no cap move. Nothing's changed, either, w/ my position on not requiring every
          commissioner to live in Juneau but instead to be where their departments and the people
          they're serving need them to be (other admins also allowed commissioners to live where
          needed, but the governors wouldnt publicly admit that). Expectation is theyre in Juneau
          for session tho.



          They dont need to put their homes up for sale, they need to chill, they need to realize
          Ive always supported on on special session on the rd system (but leggies got to call
          their's first w Sr Care - and it worked out fine)

          Good day! Next week I will be in Ketchikan speaking to the Ketchikan Rotary (Tuesday). I'm
          told a group of 15 people from Juneau will fly in for the.meeting and I expect them to ask
          questions about "Capitol Creep." Can you let me know how you have been addressing such
          questions, if at all, or if you have any suggestions for me. (Particularly as it relates
          to the PPT special session).



          The only other related question I anticipate would have to do with the Marine Highway
          System headquarters remaining in Ketchikan. I don't anticipate you changing AMHS
          headquarters back to Juneau, but if asked the question do you have anything I should say
          or know? Thanks!



          Sean
