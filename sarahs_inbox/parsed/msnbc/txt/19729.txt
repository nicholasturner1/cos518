               Thank you Randy. Yes, the surprises that would hit after discussions w/me, you, COS, etc (some
               that landed on the legislative floor) were especially perplexing. Lauren's recall of some of these
               issues has now been cleared up, in my mind, being reminded by you now of the true sequence of
               events.

               Just a few quick points:

               Alcohol Issues.

               Lauren Rice is incorrect when she says that the idea for legislation establishing mandatory minimum
               sentences for bootleggers originated with the troopers. It originated with me and arose out of a case I
               was aware of where a bootlegger got sentenced to only 160 hours of community work service after
               bootlegging into a damp or dry community.

               Recruiting

              On recruiting, after we met in Juneau in February with the Veterans Advisory Council, a member of the
              Council, a fellow by the name of Johnny Guinn from Bethel said he had 150 national guardsman returning
              to Bethel soon and many needed jobs. I believe I spoke with you about a "troops to troopers" recruiting
              program at that time starting with these national guardsman, and that you asked me to get this moving
              through Walt. To my memory, I asked Walt to follow up specifically with this group of guardsman and to
              establish a formal troops to troopers program. I recall asking Walt about, this later and I believe he said
              oh, we already do some recruiting with the military. In my opinion, we had asked him to come up with a
              new formal program with a focus on returning rural Alaskan guardsman.

               Hi Sarah,
               It was great seeing you at the picnic on Friday in Wasilla. Your new son is beautiful!

               I wanted to ask if you might be available to speak briefly during the Emergency Preparedness month
               festival in Anchorage , Loussac Library, on Saturday, September 6th at 10 a.m.?

               NAOI will provide information on great training opportunities available this winter to help people
               prepare for their outdoor adventures safely. Our focus will be winter safety such as avalanche
      i        awareness and snowmobile safety.

               Thanks! Take care.
               Debra
