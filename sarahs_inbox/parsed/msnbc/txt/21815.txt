            Not sure if this should go to Lynne (community involvement) or Randy (military youth), can
            you both check with them?

              MESSAGE:

              I am a Junior at South Anchorage High School in AFJROTC. We would like to be more
              involved with the community this year . We would love the opportunity to do a Color Guard
              or any other community services with your help. We have many seniors that really need
              more exposure in the community for their college profiles. I hope you have suggestions
              than can help us out.
