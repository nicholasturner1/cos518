        FYI-  The alcohol inventory will be kept by the state and stored in a secured area off of
        the House premises. I'm waiting to hear how they prefer to have it boxed up for long-term
        storage.  We can go ahead and box it up for now and move it into the basement pantry.



        In the meantime I'll wait for directions on how you and Meghan would like to proceed with
        the media side of things.



        House Events to consider when scheduling:

        T 5/8      10:15am.           Security Camera Training at the House

        T 5/8      3:30-4:30pm.       Look to a Book Tea for Teachers                           30

        W 5/9      4:30-6:30pm.       Governor's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser              50-200

        Th 5/10 10:00-10:30pm.        Tour-Piper's Kindergarten Class- Mrs. Winegar

        F 5/11 4:30-6:00pm.           Reception-Jnu.World Affairs Council-Mayor Botelho 45




        Thank you,

        Erika

        Great idea - you can share with jason/andy so they can start thinking of shooting I? If
        you want this done in-house.

       Might I suggest that you box some of those bottles, Governor ( Erika can still remove all
       of them right now) and we tape you doing so while also speaking to the message. It is a
       great idea for a psa and shows that ultimately life, its actions, and consequences are
       about personal responsibility.

       Erika - would have the Govs Mansion's alcohol that's in the liquor cabinet boxed up and
       removed from " the People ' s House" downstairs in the public dining area ?   Here's my
       thinking : with so many kids and teens coming and going in that house , esp during this
       season of celebrationstt for young people - proms , graduations , etc, I want to send the
       msg that we can be - and " the People ' s House" needs to be - alcohol-free . There's a lot of
       booze there - its too accessible and may be too tempting to any number of all those teens
       coming and going.



       We need to send this sobriety msg. It can be sent via support from Native Sobriety Assns,
       M. A. D. D . , Healthcare Strategies Council , or whomever can also benefit from the vocal
       support that I can provide them through this action, then I'll do it.

                  kari - fyi interview for record/schedule. also - security just called me on their
       way to pick me up for flight to skagway - now the problem is the King Air has a flat tire
       so can't fly afterall. My family is all on the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the
       niceities without me this evening in Skagway and I'll still try to get there somehow
       tomorrow ,   what a continued zoo this is , trying to get from point A to point B - and i

                         Ch. 2, Joy Mapaye, was wondering if you could call her for a quick
        interview. End of the session is here, how are things and with the arrests - is that too
        big of a distraction as the session ends? Her number is 762-9260. Please let me know if
        possible - I could also look for Irwin. Interview should either happen before 4:30 or
        after 6:00.
