             MESSAGE:

                You have my profound respect and admiration for your poignant words concerning the
             birth of your fifth child with Down syndrome. I have a daughter with the same handicap who
             is now 32 years old. I was thrilled to hear Glenn Beck's comments and richly deserved
             praise for you on his TV program. I only wish we' had a governor like you here in
             Connecticut! Every resident of Alaska can be justifiably proud. May God bless you always.
