         As Consumer Advocate for the U.S. Postal Service, part of my job is to measure how well we
         are doing in meeting the needs of our Premier Account customers by having The Gallup
         Organization conduct a customer feedback survey for us. We have recently revised the
         questions we ask in hopes that they are more efficient and applicable to your business.
         Your participation will help us improve our service.




         To participate in the survey, please go to the Web site listed below and type in your
         unique Access Code listed below.



         Web Site Address: https://gx.gallup.com/usps.gx

         Unique Access Code:           XK8746



         The survey asks questions about the mail you receive,              the mail you send, your contacts
         with the U.S. Postal Service in the past 30 days, and              a few other topics. If someone else
         at your company is better able to provide feedback on              your company's satisfaction with the
         U.S. Postal Service, please forward this request along              to the appropriate person.



        If you are not able to complete the survey on the Web, a Gallup Executive Interviewer will
        be calling you in about a week to collect your opinions by telephone.



        As always, your individual answers will be kept strictly confidential, and the information
        will only be used by Gallup to produce reports for the Postal Service showing group totals
        across all survey respondents.




        Thank you in advance for helping us with this important customer feedback survey. If you
        have any questions, you may either reply to this e-mail (all replies will be routed
        directly to Gallup) or contact Gallup Client Support at 1-888 - 297-8999.
