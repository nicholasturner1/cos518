          Kate did a phenomenal job coordinating three events at once. Way to go, Kate -- event
          planner extraordinaire!

          Thanks for yesterday's events, all! It was fun to get to knock them out in a great,
          organized, concise way like that. Thanks for the great talking points and organization
          that made it all click yesterday.

          I thought the ad in today's ADN for statehood celebration events was very cool. It looks
          like there are neat events coming up all year! Thanks so much for all that good work. It
          will be especially cool to be with other governors to sign the print and participate in
          other events with them. Thanks
