              Subject:                 CP mtg/KTUU

              In case he asks: Bill McAllister asked why, after all our mtgs with CP (even discussing
              their "Plan" yesterday for four hours), we still don't know what they're asking for - in
              terms of fiscal certainty. I told him we still don't know tax rate request, but the 20-25
              year tax lock-up has been discussed publicly by CP, but I'm sure not convinced of the need
              or Constitionality of locking up any longer than the decade we discussed early in AGIA
              debate.



              I said it sounded like the AK CP officials had to speak with Mulva this week - maybe after
              their meetings outside we'd hear more about their "Plan". . and we continue to fulfill our
              committment to not dismiss any ideas on how to commercialize our gas - but we're committed
              to AGIA and there's no need to stray from it today.
