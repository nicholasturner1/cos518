              some rush information to be faxed to him. Jonne immediately sent it and included 3
              attachments to the document. He hollered at her on the phone for intentionally clogging

                                          - I wish there were a way we could get Hamel to understand we
             are as concerned as he is ,  at we're not the enemy, and that we've got excellent
             personnel and process in place now to help oversee potential problems... we're also
             willing to work with him to make oversight even better.



             Thanks for spending the time with him that you do, John (and others). Hope he appreciates
             it.

              UPDATE: Lawmaker To Seek BP Alaska Record After Critic Letter




              DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

              December 21, 2007 6: 03 a.m.




              (Adds details ,   and comments from congressman and BP .)     By Benoit Faucon Of DOW JONES
              NEWSWIRES

              LONDON ( Dow Jones )-- A U.S. congressman said late Thursday he wants to obtain BP PLC's (BP)
              incident log book concerning a fire at its Alaska operation , after a critic ' s letter said
              subsequent repairs were more extensive than publicly known.

             The congressional request could be another headache for the British oil giant, which is
             still reeling from a part shutdown and the discovery of heavy corrosion at its Alaska
             giant oil field, Prudhoe Bay , as well as a deadly blast at a Texas refinery.

             In a letter sent this week to George Miller , D.-Calif ., chairman of the U . S. House of
             Representative ' s Education and Labor Committee , BP critic Charles Hamel said repairs
             needed following an Aug . 6 fire at its Alaska operations were more extensive than publicly
             disclosed.

             A spokesman for Miller said , " We continue to be concerned with safety issues at BP's
             Prudhoe Bay facility. We are preparing a request for the daily log" of operations at the
             facility where the fire took place.

             In addition , Hamel said members of a BP external board were steered away from the damaged
             area - even though the board was specifically hired to oversee the way BP deals with
             operational challenges.

             A BP spokesman refused to comment on the assertions contained in the letter.

             However, he said, "In addition to being thoroughly investigated by BP, the Aug. 6 turbine
             fire... was investigated by the state fire marshall and by the state petroleum systems
             integrity office."

             The fire , described as small by a Dow Jones Newswires report at the time , was one of five
             such incidents reported by BP between early August and early October at its Alaska fields.

             Hamel, who has passed information about safety issues at BP's Alaska operations to the
                                                          2

              media for many years , told Dow Jones Newswires that the alleged lack of public disclosure
              is only "the tip of the iceberg " and that more issues may surface regarding safety at BP's
              Alaska operations.

              As the head of the House committee overseeing workers' safety , Miller has kept closed tabs
              on BP ' s Alaska problems.. This summer, the lawmaker said he was looking into allegations
              that BP had allowed nearly double . the amount of compressed natural gas to build up in a
              processing facility, potentially putting workers in the vicinity at risk in event of an
        I     explosion.
