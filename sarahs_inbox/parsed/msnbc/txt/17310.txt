             Subject:        PORT AUTHORITY COMMENT TO ROD BOYCE - FINAL APPROVAL NEEDED
             Importance: High
            Before I send Joe's written response to Rod Boyce's question for the Governor, I'd like to
            ensure that I have final approval

            Rod's follow-up questions:

            I have two follow-up questions that stem from the governor's response to my earlier query about the
            port authority's 2005 advertisement:

            1. The governor suggests in her previous response that other entities might have a better gas line
            proposal than what the port authority has put forward. Presumably that would have been the case in
            2005 as well. So why did the governor endorse the statement In the May 2005 newspaper ad?

            2. The governor says in her response that the port authority was the only entity "with terms available
            to the public." How was it wise to make such a strong statement of support for the port authority's
            proposal in the absence of information about other proposals?


            Joe's suggested response with the Governor:
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I told Rod that I would have something for him by the end of today.

            Thanks,
            Meg
