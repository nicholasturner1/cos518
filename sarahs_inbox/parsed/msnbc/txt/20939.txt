          MESSAGE:

          Dear Miss Palin, Governor,rnlt was with great interest I read the Ruffini opinion article
          on your performance prior to and after election to office in Alaska. There are far to few
          'American Statesmen' in this day and age. I dearly hope that your future includes more
          service to the greater community, which makes up these United States.    if your ambition
          or call to serve expands and includes Arizona please feel free to ask for my assistance.
          Respectfully,  Glenn E. Bell, Sgt Ret. rnBio: USAF 6yrs, Law Enforcement 24 yrs,
          Veterans Counselor- Military Order of the Purple Heart/American Legion. Currently
          employed: Superior Courts, State of Arizona, Maricopa County Security Services.
