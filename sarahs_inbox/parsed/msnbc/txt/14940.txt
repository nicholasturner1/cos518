           MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,




          I am not a resident of Alaska, but I just had to write and say that your story is just
          inspiring.   You don't back down or compromise on important issues just because it is the
          popular thing to do. I was also encouraged when I read about you and your husband's
          response to the doctor's news about your son, Trig, "Well, why not us." It is such a
          blessing to Alaska to have a leader with such spiritual strength and moral integrity. As
          lawyer, I am confronted daily with issues which conflict with my own personal beliefs. It
          is difficult sometimes because lawyers are always supposed to make the argument in a
          "moral vacuum."   It is difficult to do the right thing when it is not the popular thing.
          However, I read your biography and reviewed    the policies and laws that you have
          endorsed/ enacted, and it seems you are able to strike a balance. You stay true to who
          you are.   You are an example to not only your constituents, but to people in this county
          looking for true examples of leadersh

          ip.     You should SERIOUSLY consider a run for the white House             (if you are ever so moved.)




          As I said, I am not from Alaska, but at least one set of eyes in Delaware will be looking
          for your name in years to come
