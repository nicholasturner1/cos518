          Dear Governor Palin! I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate and respect you as
          our governor . You are a model of honor and righteousness in a world that does not always
          value those virtues.   I was so touched by the birth of your new baby and the Godly stand
          you made for life .  I am praying for you and your family .  May God bless you, guide you,
          and be your Strength moment by moment .  Sincerely , Andie Rice
