             Welcome back Governor!

             Kyle Hopkins is doing a story that will be published this weekend similar to the one Sabra
             was working on regarding special sessions being held outside of Juneau. He would like a
             few minutes of your time this afternoon regarding the fall session and your philosophy on
             where commissioners should live (is there any mandate?).

             In case he asked you where you are spending your time, I have already told him that the
             mansion is undergoing needed repairs i.e. windows, pipes etc . and your office Is undergoing
             asbestos abatement.

             His numbers are 257-4334 and cell 382 2159.

             Please let me know if you would like me to handle this. I do feel that strong words from
             you regarding the special session will hit home.

             Thank you.
