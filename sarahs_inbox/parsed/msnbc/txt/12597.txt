             Governor Palin:




             I've read a lot recently about       your being considered as a vice-presidential candidate for
             Senator McCain . It's also been      a large topic on the talk radio shows . When that happens, I
             assume you will be too busy to       respond to requests . Is it possible to receive an
             autographed photo? If it helps       save time and money , I could send a self - adressed stamped
             envleope as well as a print of       your offcial governor ' s photograph.



             Thanks for considering this. God bless you and your family.
