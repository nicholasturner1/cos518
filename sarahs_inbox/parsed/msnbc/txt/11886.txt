               This is how I found out

               FYI, I was the talk of the capitol yesterday too b /c of the Frontiersman 's typo in my piece-calling it Gasoline
               Inducement Act instead of "Gasline ." Hawker and others were making fun of this fact and could have also sent it
               on. For the record , the mistake has been corrected.

               Shame on Andrew Halcro.

               I was dismayed by his shot at you on his blog today . This guy wants to be governor? If so, he better start acting
               gubernatorial. His shot at you was far from that.

               Hang in there.
