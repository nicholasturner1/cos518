             Mike and Janice:

             The governor has agreed to participate in this event.

             Janice : Can you give me some tentative dates that I can give to Newsweek?

             Beth:

             It was a pleasure to speak with you briefly this evening to confirm the PricewaterhouseCoopers
             LLP Sponsorship of Newsweek's Inaugural Los Angeles Women and Leadership Conference.
             Per our discussion, this gathering will be scheduled as an evening reception and forum
             discussion in February 2008 at a precise date mutually agreeable to both Governor Palin and
             Governor Napolitano.

             A discussion between the two Governors will be moderated by Newsweek's West Coast Editor,
             Karen Breslau, and each leader will be invited to discuss how their independent and unique
             governing styles apply in their respective states, each with very different political demographics.
             This discussion will complement Karen Breslau's article about the Governors that appears in the
             Third Annual Women and Leadership issue on newsstands now. Invited guests will include an
             impressive list of women in leadership positions representing entertainment, business, academic
             philanthropic and academic communities.

             We'd like to announce this event tomorrow as an extension of our annual East Coast Women and
             Leadership events. Please confirm receipt of this email and Governor Palin's willingness to
             have this special event introduced and acknowledged at tomorrow's event.
