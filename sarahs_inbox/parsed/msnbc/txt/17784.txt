        Governor:

        I talked with Mark Campbell who was in Wasilla when Colleen Sullivan-Leonard read the
        proclamation there.  He said pastors in Palmer did not read it because of the passages I
        conveyed to you in a different email. He had already surmised that you had not seen the
        proclamation and said he would convey that message to the Palmer pastors. Your presence
        at the Unity Sunday service was key in folks being comfortable with this explanation. He
        said they came away confident that it would be rewritten for next year. I said I was sure
        it would.

        I still haven't heard back who wrote it. When I find out I"ll know.                   In the meantime I'm
        glad you emailed me about it

       Final point, I promise. What I wanted to get out of this was a clearer picture of who to
       talk to in this situation. I don't know who would have had authority (and time) to get
       the proclamation changed. Who would you have wanted me to talk to?

       Relevant portions:



       "It is not the intent of this proclamation to promote a particular religion, but rather to
       encourage thoughtful reflection on the condition of our state and country and to honor our
       freedom of religious expression whether that is prayer, alms giving, fasting, peace
       activism, meditation, promotion of social justice or another form of contemplative action.



       IZ'-2




       ...I urge you to join fellow Americans across racial, political, and religious boundaries
       to observe the National Day of Prayer within your respective communities and faith
       traditions.



       IZ11



       "May we be thankful for our blessings, reflect on the many needs of our state and nation,
       treat our neighbors with dignity and respect, and seek moral and spiritual renewal through
       the religious or spiritual expression which most closely aligns with who we are as
       individuals.



       Iz



       Now, therefore... proclaim ...as National Day of Prayer in Alaska and encourage Alaskans to

        I don't know, it was delivered to my office - so I don't know who signed off on it.1Z14 It
        was in final form when I received it, so I thought that you had seen it.1z' These are
        usually done by Michelle Fabrello , but it ' s been my experience that someone in the
        Governor ' s office signs off on it.lZli I don't know anymore than that.

        Governor:



        IZ'iWe don't know each other really well, and I'm going out on a limb here, but the
        proclamation I read today for National Day of Prayer did not sound like you.IZ11 It was,
        and I apologize for my language here, mamby-pamby pabulum.IZII I did not have an
        opportunity to read it before around 10 a.m. this morning.1Z'



        izl-l



        ill




        After the Governor's Prayer Breakfast, and your statements there (which I again heard much
        positive feedback on today from the pastors who were at the Day of Prayer gathering), the
        proclamation was almost embarrassing.IZ'-i I am always honored to offer remarks on your
        behalf and I don't mean to sound ungrateful for the opportunity - but, you asked us to
        tell it to you straight and so, I'm believing that you meant that.




        IZ11



        I held onto this email for about 30 minutes before sending it.iZ;l In that time, I was told
        the Valley pastors who gathered for National Day of Prayer did not read the proclamation
        because of the wording.iZ',i I guess that' s my confirmation that I should hit the send
        button.

        Thanks for all that you do and I know you're working hard on other issues, but I have been
        a witness to what happens when a Governor is insulated from any criticism.lZ I believe
        you can be an incredibly successful Governor.
