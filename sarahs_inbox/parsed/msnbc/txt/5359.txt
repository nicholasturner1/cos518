             Sharon and Meg,



             Governor Palin will appoint Marvin Hamilton as Bethel Superior Court Judge

             and Anna Moran as Kenai Superior Court Judge. I've attached their bios from

             their packets.      If you need more information don't hesitate to contact me.



             Thanks,



             Ivy
