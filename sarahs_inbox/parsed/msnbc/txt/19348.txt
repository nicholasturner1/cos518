               Here is an email I just received . I think it hits home along the lines of what we have discussed about the
               needed change in F&G.

               Mr. N. I am forwarding an email to Denby (which he requested) on my (our) thoughts
               about replacing the Deputy Commissioner for Wildlife at F&G. Although there are a
               huge number of Alaskans who realize that the Governor has not made any progress on
               her "managing for abundance" direction, there is an opportunity here to take small
               steps in that direction. I think the earlier confrontational attitudes are set aside for
               now and most of us would really like to see her and the Department move in the right
               direction.

               Hope the Special Session goes well for the Acting Chief of Staff, I'm headed for
               Gakona to catch a few more sockeye in the fishwheel.

               Commissioner, Thanks for including us (me) in your search for a new DC. You are
               aware I was not a KTaylor fan when you selected him but you did use him to best
               effect and mostly kept him out of the chain of command for Wildlife issues. His
               replacement can be an opportunity to take a few steps for the management of wildlife
               adding emphasis on actions that result in desired changes to the various wildlife
               populations. Jennifer Yuhas, who confided your conversation with her, and a few
               locals met me for lunch and we discussed what we could say to help you.

               In the early Knowles administration, I had several discussions with the then
               Commissioner Rue and Wildlife Director Smith about why it was that we had
               established "minimum conditions" for fish resources (like minimum escapement) but
               even with the emphasis added by the Legislature with the intensive management
               statute revisions, we couldn't seem to get behind the "minimum conditions" (like
               population objectives set by the Board of Game) for wildlife. I suspect commercial
               fishing interests with the attendant political pressures had a lot to do with keeping the

              feet to the fire for fish. There is no parallel on the wildlife side and I certainly can't compare
              Alaska's professional hunting organizations with the interest or clout of commercial
              fishermen. I and many other Alaskans and the Legislators expected the IM changes would
              result in "emphasis added".

              The lack of enthusiasm in the Department for "managing" to the population objective
              minimums needs some emphasis and we are hoping a new Deputy Commissioner can work
              in that direction as well as continue the Federal coordination interface and the more detailed
              but cumbersome issues like endangered species coordination.

               The coordination functions can best be served by someone who knows the "bottom line" on
               both sides of the issue and can both hold the line for Alaska's interests and recognize how far
               the federal interests can and will go. It is my opinion that some of your
               present "representatives" can talk the talk but lack the ability to get tough when its needed. I
               would recommend you consider someone with background and backbone in Wildlife issues
               and controversies and avoid someone who just "wants to get along with everyone".

               One issue a new DC can review is the relationship between having some resources serve
               statewide issues as opposed to regional issues. The new sheep biologist position for Region
               II is an example. I don't think Doug or anyone else thinks that position won't serve the
               whole spectrum of dall sheep issues regardless of which region needs assistance. There are
               some "specialties" that would best serve as "statewide" resources and they could be
               coordinated by the new DC regardless of where the office is physically located. I remain an
               advocate of having the Directors and Deputies and Special Assistants located down the hall
               from your office whenever possible.

               It is not my intent to recommend you shake up the internal politics of the Department with
               this appointment, rather, I'd like to see some small steps to add emphasis to the management

               possibilities for the Wildlife Conservation Division.

               I wish we had a perfect name for you on this one, but we don't. I would be happy to discuss
               any "other" names you might have in mind and I wish you luck in finding the right person.
               We remain committed to helping you manage for abundance . The energy crisis points out
               the extreme value in providing resources for Alaskans to eat. I'm sure both Boards will hear
               a lot about that this Fall.

               I'm headed south again Wednesday to see if I can catch a few more Copper River sockeye.
               Good luck.
