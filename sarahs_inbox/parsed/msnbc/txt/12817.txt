           Anything lawmakers need to approve on this to accomplish this?

          I'm still asked (six months later, after visiting the troops overseas where I promised
          this would be addressed): what's the progress on hunt/fish lic for active duty? Free? What
          about deployed troops who missed hunt season? Pls email an update so we take take action
          on it soon. If lawmakers have to tweak something, I'm sure there are patriotic leggies
          (Dahlstrom, Lynn, Stoltze...) who would support this action - is that end already being
          worked? Thanks

           The Honorable Governor Sarah Palin,




          Thank you for coming to Seward for the Centennial of the Iditarod. People were very
          impressed with your fortitude towards the cold and wind! Here are some pictures I took of
          the event. Again, thank you for coming to Seward and we hope to have you back soon. You
          might also look on sewardcitynews.com where there is a video clip posted.
