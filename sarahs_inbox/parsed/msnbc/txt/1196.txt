MESSAGE:

Well, this was the closest category I could find. <G> I want to congratulate you and your husband on
the birth of your son, and I guess that would come under "labor" - with a small "I".

Seriously, I hope you are all doing well and am glad the baby is healthy. Being born in good clean
Alaskan air can't hurt, either.



I'd love to move to the state but my wife says no; she can't stand the winter cold. I spent three years
in Maine, so -40 can't be too much worse than -27 in Downeast Maine.



I wish you, your son and your whole family good health and God' s blessings.



Sincerely,

Robert Paine
