        Governor - The Global Tempest Exercise is being held @ the Captain Cook Hotel. You are to
        arrive @ 8:45 a.m., Commissioner Jackson will escort you to the Quarter Deck where photo
        will be taken and then you will give "remarks" at 9:00 a.m. Sharon Leighow has these
        remarks, I've checked with her this a.m. This is when Commissioner Jackson would like to
        ride with you to the next meeting. Then you are going to drive from the Captain Cook to
        the ANTHC Consortium Office Building, 4000 Ambassador Drive (approx. 20 min. drive). You
        will be giving remarks to the Alaska Native Health Board bi-annual MEGA Meeting. Sharon
        Leighow is working on these remarks today.
