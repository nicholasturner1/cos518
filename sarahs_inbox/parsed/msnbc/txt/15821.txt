           MESSAGE:

           Dear Govenor Patin:




           Greetings from the Great State of Washington! My name is May Palmer, (www.maypalmer.com).




           I wanted to tell you how great you were on a recent edition of the 'Glen Beck' Show! I was
           very impressed with your fiscal conservatism and your presentation.




           I am also urging you to consider being Vice President to John McCain if asked. You make
           such an remarkable Vice President and believe me when I say, your country needs you! I
           hope that you will accept the offer if extended by Senator McCain.



                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA_GSP01_0018888

            I will be in Alaska at Fort Greely MRW performing in concert on June 21st & 22nd. If your
            busy schedule permits, perhaps you might join us? In the meantime, please feel free to
