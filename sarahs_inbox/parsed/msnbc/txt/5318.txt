               Subject: PPT Payments



               Governor,



               The bulk of the first month's payments under PPT (those for January production) have been
               received, and are about 4% higher than we had predicted. This means that our PPT models
               may prove to be fairly accurate, and slightly conservative, which is good.



               The real test will be in a month when the companies have to make their "true-up" payment
               on production from April - December 2006. This is the payment on the difference between
               what they already paid (based on ELF) and what they now owe under PPT. We're counting on
               payments totalling almost $1B, so it's important our models are close to reality. So far,
               so good. I'll keep you posted.



               - Pat
