           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,

          Congratulations on the birth of your new baby- he is beautiful. There was a story about
          you and your new baby on MSN.com. I am a nurse at Childrens Specialized Hospital in New
          Jersey and I view every child as a gift. Every child is here for a reason, I believe the
          main reason is to give us someone else to love! I wish you and your family the best! God
          bless all of you.

          Sincerely,

          Elaine weaver

          (mom to 2 boys 7 and almost 3-he wont let you call him 3 yet even though his birthday is
          5/12!)
