            April 22 , 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today expressed her full support
            for Department of Corrections Commissioner Joe Schmidt.



             "Commissioner Schmidt has my full support as he and his team continue to bring remarkable
             reforms to the Department of Corrections ," Governor Palin said .   " Joe has emphasized
             recruitment , hiring 34 new officers in FY 2007 and authorizing an additional 43 officers
             for FY 2008 .   Joe's strength is his respect for the hard work and talent of his
             department ' s employees . He understands the role the department plays in protecting the
             public while providing offenders with the opportunity to successfully return to society.
              Joe has my unconditional support."
