               Governor,

               My sincerest apologies. I forwarded to Sharon an outdated copy of the national talking points earlier
               today. Attached is the latest with the most recent. It is all the same information as you had last week for
               Kudlow, with the exception that we added an AGIA section toward the top of the document and then
               potential AGIA questions under that section, too.

               Thank you. And again , my apologies. Kurt had to slap me up-side the head tonight before I realized what I
               had done!

               Meg
