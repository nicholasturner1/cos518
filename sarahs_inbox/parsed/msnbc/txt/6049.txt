        Excellent on many fronts JK. Thanks for this update.



        We received Exxon's $21,000,000 check for PT "delay". Another nice victory.

        Subject: Alaska Related Riders/House Appropriations Bill




        In view of your previous inquiry, I want to update you on the final = outcome of House
        action on the Alaska related amendments to the Interior = Appropriations bill.



        In my opinion, these actions are significant for two reasons. = First, the amendments
        address important issues of public land = management and use in Alaska. Second, the House
        action may tell us    something about voting patterns regarding Alaska resource issues in
        the = current Congress.




        Given the circumstances, I think we did quite well:



       * By a healthy margin, the House defeated an amendment that would have = jeopardized polar
       bear management in Canada. This amendment was = opposed by the Canadian government, US
       Fish and Wildlife Service, various = wildlife groups, and us.

       * Congressman Udall withdrew his amendment to restrict claims of access = under RS 2477 in*
       the western public land states. Instead, legislative= history requests the Bush
       administration to report to Congress when = certain procedures and policies are
       implemented.  This should not be = a significant barrier to RS 2477 claims.
                                                                 1

        * Amendments to prohibit the King Cove land exchange and oil and gas = leasing in Bristol
        Bay were not considered on the House floor.

        * Our only real defeat was the House ' s adoption by a 2 to 1 margin of = the Chabot
        amendment , which would prohibit the construction of timber = roads through any roadless
        areas of the Tongass.   At the moment , = there is no similar rider in the Senate's version
        of the Interior = Appropriations bill, and the Bush administration can be expected to
        oppose = the Chabot amendment because it would derogate from the Tongass planning =
        process.

        Of course , this is just he first salvo in what may be a long campaign = in the current
        Congress . However , we will take victories where we = can , and perhaps our opponents will
        take heed that anti-Alaska resource = legislation may not be so easy to enact after all.
