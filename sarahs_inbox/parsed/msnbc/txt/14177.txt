                One of the few House members to vote against the resolution, Minority Leader Beth Kerttula, D-
                Juneau, charged Monday that some lawmakers were using the resolution to try to derail the
                AGIA process.
                "I've seen a lot of aspersions and demagoguery and confusion and subterfuge used in the last
                week," she said at a news conference. "My protest vote was to say, `We're not going to let this
                get derailed' - at least I'm not going to."
                Kerttula refused to give names but said later she thought there were lawmakers who wanted the
                AGIA process to fail and were using the resolution as a "smokescreen." She said she was
                concerned lawmakers would put all the focus on a smaller line and then say they couldn't go
                ahead with the TransCanada line.
