           Subject:                HB 370


           HB 370 is supposed to be signed by May 7 (next Wed.) and is sponsored by Rep. Kelly. It
           would allow decisions regarding wildland fire management to include the cultural and
           economic value of structures located on affected lands, whether they be privately owned or
           owned by the State ...

           This bill will codify current practice by DNR of also weighing the value of cabins ,              lodges
           and other structures.

           This is the bill that you could go to Fairbanks and have a signing ceremony there, if you
           desire.
