        Sarah et al, I am getting more info from my clients saying the oil industry

        is really gearing up local "business leaders" to oppose AGIA. They are

        having a big lunch this week all organized by Jim Jansen from Lynden (one of

        our arch enemies in the campaign) I am suggesting a press conference by

        sarah in advance of this saying she is aware this is going on and that the

        boards of these organizations need to consider the will of the people before

        they take any traitorous actions.



        The election was a referendum on the stranded gas act and the producers

        monopoly over the gasline and the people clearly spoke. This clearly is a

        turning point for Alaska, just like wally said in his oped on Sunday. The

        choice will be whether alaska charts its own destiny or whether we will be

        dictated to by outside corporations, just like we were when the outiside

        fish companies controlled alaska.          That's why we fought for statehood in the

        first place.



        They will pull out all the guns for the finance committees which will be our

        toughest committees.        I have heard they are planning to fly in employees and

        other businesses to.testify.



        I will write more as I hear i
