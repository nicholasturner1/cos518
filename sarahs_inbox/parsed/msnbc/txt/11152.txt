             What's the beef Fagan is supposedly making over my 6pm speech? AP told me Lyda is fussing
             about it, said she may not come, Harris (er, John Bitney) reportedly wants a detailed
             explanation. AP asked if I really had a plane to catch- (how would they even know this?!).
             I explained the speech has been set for a month-and-a-half, no one complained back then...
             and my flt to travel to attend my son's graduation into the Infrantry was made AFTER the
             speech time was set.
