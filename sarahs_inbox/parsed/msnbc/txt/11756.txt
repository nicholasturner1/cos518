              If they concentrate on the "quasi-move" aspect of this... It's very, very important the
              message is: "We'll continue close monitoring of present structure, as we implementing an
              MOU that is a quasi-move of Habitat. The MOU will ensure even more prudent oversight of
              Habitat and our committment to safe, sound, publicly-supported permitting and developing
              of our precious national resources."
