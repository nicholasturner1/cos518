         John brown and ken klunder will be in office on tuesday to see u, says my dad. They are
         valley correspondence educators, supporters of Lindas, friends of ours... They were told
         by whomever answers state phones that your plate was full, u couldn't see them, but
         they've decided to camp out at the office in hopes of catching u "for just five minutes"
         so says my dad. Evidently the correspondence program will be changed dramatically by
         Wednesday and the changes will adversely affect homeschoolers/christian schoolers, etc...
         They said they knew your kids were in a private school program so you'd understand how
         significant the issue is.



         I'm happy to meet w them also and we need to make sure Larry LeDoux is kept in the loop
         once the folks tell us the issue. Evidently the changes "we" (?) are making results in
         losing 600 students from corr. program. Not good.



         So let's look for them on tuesday. Thanks



         Fb- this may be some action taken by bd of ed ? So you in-the - loop is valuable too. Thanks
