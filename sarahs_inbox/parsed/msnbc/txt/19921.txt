          Yep, that transcript sounds like something Wooten would say.

             He claims Chuck Heath was going to take Molly's tag and shoot a moose

          with it? Not true . I recall that Chuck Heath was offering to take Molly

          hunting since the season was coming to a close and Wooten had still not

          taken the time to take her hunting so she could fill the tag. Chuck

          Heath wasn ' t going to "shoot a moose, period", as Wooten claims. And

          after the hunt Wooten told Chuck Heath that Molly DID shoot that moose,

          which wasn ' t true . As WPD officer Chris Watchus testified ( he was the

          hunting partner in the boat as Wooten illegally shot the animal from a

          motorized vehicle , which is also illegal ), Wooten did not give Molly a

          chance to shoot it before he fired . Afterwards , Wooten threatened Molly

          that she'd better not tell anyone , but people eventually found out.. about

          it after Wooten bragged about the hunt.

          Yes, I've received Tier 2 permits and I have filled my tags, with

          friends and family witnessing the hunts .    It appears from the transcript

          that Wooten states to his fellow union member / internal investigator re:

          Chuck Heath ". . . He does it every year   ( with ) Sarah's caribou tag." Not

          true. And Wooten has NEVER hunted with me , and except for his illegal
                                                        2




                                                                                                       PRA GSP01_0021952

          moose hunt in question he has never hunted moose or caribou with family,

          so his accusation that Chuck Heath takes caribou on my, or others,

          permits every year is not based on fact.
