Todd,

You're welcome!

I met and got along great with the WA Residence Managers at the NGA seminar last year. The 1st
Gentleman seems to focus on just a couple of issues and golf-and he's retired. I agree with you in
that most 1st Spouses have the luxury of time to take up causes. You're smart to focus on labor and
causes important to Alaskans.

Hope you enjoy D.C.

Thanks,

Erika

Let me know if you want me to make any phone calls in regards to the fax or go over and see if it was
sent later.
