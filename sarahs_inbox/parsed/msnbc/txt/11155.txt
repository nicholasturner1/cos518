             Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 14th, 2008




             Dear All:



             APIA, APICDA, and Delta Western are still working together to attempt a

             fuel delivery to Nikolski.        The marine charter did not go this weekend,

             due to weather. The rest of the week does not look promising either, as

             hurricane force winds are expected tonight, with the tail end of the

             storm near the end of the week.



             Nikolski estimates that the electricity should make it.for a few days

             but have taken the last nine drums to the power plant. When the school

             is open and the clinic is heated by electric heaters, both generators

             are needed and the fuel usage can be as high as 150 gallons a day. Other

             homes out of heating oil are also heating with electricity.



             Today, we are looking into an air charter, but this situation is

             bankrupting the community which will soon be without the jobs to run the

             community. The funding will only cover one or two more efforts. Let

             today's cold weather remind us how fortunate we are and how undeserving

             Nikolski is of this preventable situation.



                                                                     1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01 0010011
