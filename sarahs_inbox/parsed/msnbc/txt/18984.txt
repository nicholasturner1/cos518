              Subject: girls

            I'm going to try and track down the girls tonight (Bristol and I played phone tag all weekend). If you're back from
            your trip you should come with us-it's manicure night.

            I'm having lunch with Kyle today in ANC and will keep the conversation general, unless I hear otherwise. I, of
            course, will brag you up, but he knows to expect that anyway : )
