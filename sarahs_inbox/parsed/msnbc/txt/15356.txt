              Dear Governor Palin,

              Attached is a letter I sent to Anchorage Legislators today. We remain concerned about the capital budget
              and possible vetoes. As I told your staff people when they visited, the projects in the capital budget that
              came from our priority lists are critical projects for Anchorage. We hope you give them full consideration.

              I am available to talk to you anytime about the projects . You can call me at my office at 343-7100 or on
              my cell at yj

              Sincerely,
              Mark Begich
