              Subject: Re: Schedule - OCTOBER
             Sorry - I didn't know anyone was waiting on me for these travel dates. Is there a way I can see
             the tentative schedules so I don't keep people waiting so long?

             First, I"ll have to go through the NY travel sched. as I thought it was already a done deal and the
             tickets were purchased for my dep. and arr. dates/times. For some reason I thought I was flying
             through the night to get to NY by morning.

             I did not know of the invitations to the formal events next weekend, so let me check with Todd
             on his slope schedule.

               There are some large scheduling requests that we need to decide upon as the dates are being
               held and we need to know whether you will be available for other requests coming in during
               those dates.

               Also, what is the expectation for my time during Special Session? Is it expected I be in juno
               throughout?
