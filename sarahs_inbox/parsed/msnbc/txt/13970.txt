             Thanks, and back at ya! I spoke w/Nizich and gave him a heads up that we'll be hiring
             Britta for scheduling and administrative support in Anchorage.   No problem.  They'll
             likely need to hire someone once Hannah leaves for back-up staff support to Sunny &
             Janice.  Which is fine. . .maybe part-time would even work.



            An praying for everything this week...

            You're the best Kris. Thank you. Now I'm off to more meetings with more of our best
            friends.



            Also- DON'T come into the office when your brother is here visiting, ok??? Please. I may
            visit schools on Friday instead of working in Anchorage office- so all the more reason you
            not come in. "Work" from home and email, don't put in for time off even.

            Hi Britta!  I'll follow-up with you directly - via email - on details the Governor and I
            have discussed on an opening in the Anchorage office.



            Hope you're enjoying Spain!

             Hellooooo!   Yes, we want to find something for you. Glad you're taking evening classes
             because we pretty much only have daytime work. Let me CC in Kris Perry on this email, as
             Kris and I have discussed what availabilities we have in the Anchorage Office(s). She'll
             contact you. Glad you're soon headed home! Enjoy. Take in all that culture, because as you
             know you ain't gonna' get that around here. Thanks Britta... Kris is on this email
             exchange now.

                                   Hey There!




                               Hope everything is going well. I have one more day left of school and I
            have another spring break! Won't be long until I am back in Alaska, it is just around the
            corner. I was wondering if I might be able to work for you once I got back in the summer
            and into my school year? School Starts late August and I have class registration in the
            next few days. I have somewhat mapped out my class schedule and am taking evening classes
            4pm- 9pm Monday-Thursday (for the most part). I have not a clue as to what hours would be
            better but I am very flexible and it is easy to change. Anyhow, hope I caught you at a
            good time.. Have a wonderful Wednesday!



                                   Love,
