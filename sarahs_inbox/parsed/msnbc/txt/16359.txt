             Actually the wording is for remand for the court to remit the punitive damages accordingly
             for 507.5 million. This suggests more of a directive rather than further reduction. Talis.

             John,



             It has been reported on radio that the Supreme Court has sent the ruling back to the 9th
             circuit to determine the amount awarded (not to exceed the $500 million). Is that
             accurate?



             Kris
