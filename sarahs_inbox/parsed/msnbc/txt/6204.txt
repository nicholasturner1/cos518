               Subject: AK Humanities Forum

             I spoke with the executive director of the Alaska Humanities Forum today (Dr. Greg Kimura ). They have a couple
             of seats open on their board that are actual forum appointments (not appointments the governor directly makes).

             Dr. Kimura would like to fill those seats with people Governor Palin is close with or knows well. He suggested
             Meg Stapleton and Tails Colberg . He said he met with Meg back during her KTUU days about serving on the
             board and would still be interested in her serving (of course only if time allows with her busy schedule at home
             and work). Tails served on the board a couple of years ago when he was on the Assembly and worked in private
             practice . I will talk to Meg and Tails if you are interested in having them serve on this board and if they feel
             comfortable with the added time commitment It's a unique opportunity to work with the Humanities Forum on
             appointments that they make at their discretion . They also asked for your feedback . If there is anybody you have
             in mind for this board they would graciously accept your input.

             The Humanities Forum develops programs , projects and policies as they relate to encouraging interest in the
             humanities in Alaska . It's a 6 year term and members meet 3 times a year in 2 day meetings.
