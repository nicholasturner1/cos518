Todd - Apparently the Chamber of Wasilla has ordered a gift basket as a surprise for the Governor.
They have asked some questions which I do no know . Would you be able to help out with this
request - or direct me in the right direction . They need this information right away as the Gift Basket
will be delivered on Tuesday , 06.24 . Thanks , Janice

I so appreciate your assistance. This will be given to Governor Palin on Tuesday so if I can get the
information by Sunday That would give me time to get the items. Again thank you for your
assistance.
