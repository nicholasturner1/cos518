              Joe and I are done with a draft and will send it in 5 minutes.

             I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the
             works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don't know if
             something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




             Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my. oil and gas world, so
             this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
             thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.


                                                                     1
