              MESSAGE:

              Governor Palin,

              Thank you for your response to the Alaska Supreme Court's outrageous decision regarding
              Alaska's parental consent law and the judicial bypass provided in SB24 in 1997. I know a
              little bit about this--as I was the prime sponsor of this legislation. I concur with your
              direction to Attorney General Colberg to file a petition for rehearing. I have thoughts
              on the timing of this that I would be happy to discuss with you.



              As you know, enforcing Alaska's parental involvement statute is vitally important.



              Loren Leman
