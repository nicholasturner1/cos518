          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin; In 2006 Alaska was honored and blessed to have you become our Governor,
          and now its your turn to be blessed with Trig; a special bundle of joy. God knew what He
          was doing when He gave you and Todd this beautiful angel. You are definitely an
          inspiration for all of us.

          We are praying for you and your family.

          Dianne and Richard, Anchorage
