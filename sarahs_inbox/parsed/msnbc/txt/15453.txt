             On Wednesday, May 28th around 1 Oam we will have a bill signing ceremony at the Sheraton.

             Confirmed legislation/participants are: SB 120 (ELLIS) and HB 226 (COGHILL) with Commissioner
             Bishop plus 2 other labor dept employees

             Possible legislation/participants: HB 2 and HB 61 (both NEUMAN)

             We will need to work with the AGIA folks to determine a place a little out of the way. I'll try and finalize the
             details on Tuesday.

             Thanks to all. Have a terrific weekend.
