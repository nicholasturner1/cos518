              Annette's seeing what she can see on email addresses to perhaps find out who leaked the
              email . Of course the reporter won't reveal his source ... but I would think even he is
              baffled that someone sent the email directly to him.

              I am at a loss for words ; but clearly very angry at someone or some procedure. You
              Governor and this Administration deserves better .  Unacceptable problem .  We need to know
              what happened to protect confidential deliberative discussions and must trust the team
              completely !  Right now I am certain that I trust those on this email and would add Pat,
              kris , and Frank.   Tom

               Sunny- the email you forwarded to a list of state employees this morning re: better
              communications with Mayors just got posted on the ADN blog after being leaked to a
              reporter. Any idea who'd leak such a thing?
