          MESSAGE:

          I am very disappointed to hear that wolverine trapping will be allowed in chugach

          State park.     It is a danger both to myself and my animals not to mention a

          consumptive use of a fairly rare creature that I would also like to photograph.                          Please

          have the Board of Game listen to the public and their biologists or replace them.
