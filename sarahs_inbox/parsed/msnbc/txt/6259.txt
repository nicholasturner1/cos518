        MESSAGE:

        Dear Governor Sarah Palin,

            I am Katherine Fueller and I am a new board member of the Palmer Senior Citizen
        Center. I would like to thank you for helping us get started on a new center that is
        sorely needed as the one we are in is very old and does not fit our growth any more. We
        all appreciate your support and are proud of the job you are doing.




                                                    Yours gratefully,

                                                     Katherine Fueller
