           Governor,



           I've checked with everyone here; they've reviewed their contacts and there is no record of
           any contact here in Anchorage.

           Anyone know who she's been trying to contact in my office? I have not heard. I did have
           lunch with all the Vet organizations, here at the mansion, to work with them on getting
           supplies for deployed personnel - it was John Minnick's (and others) group. Sears gave
           them a discount on supplies that Diana Straub was requesting for one deployed battalion.
           Pls see what you can do here, so this constituent is helped and doesn't take it out on us
           in a newspaper interview. Thanks

           Good Morning Governor,



           I thought you should see this article (link below) that was in yesterday's Frontiersman.
           About two thirds into the article this Wasilla constituent says that she has contacted the
           Governor's office and will continue to email every day until she gets a response. Since
          .her son is in the Marines I gave her initial correspondence , which was sent last week, to
           Senator Murkowski ' s office in Wasilla . I spoke with Senator Murkowski ' s office again this
           morning; they are on top of this and will be contacting her directly. I also called her
           myself and told her the steps our office had taken.



           Just wanted you to be aware in case you are asked about it.
