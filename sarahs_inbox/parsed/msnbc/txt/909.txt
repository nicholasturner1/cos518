 Todd,
 Here's the information for the AK Trails PSA.

        . We would need Mr. Palin from 1 Oam-4pm (at the most)
        . Any day from March 24-28 would work for all on this end
        · We would shoot in Hatcher Pass

           Jillian L. Morrissey
           Executive Director, Alaska Trails

 Thanks,
 Erika
