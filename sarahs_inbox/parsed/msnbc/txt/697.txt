  Governor,

 I spoke with Hans as well as Mike today about the CACFA Presser. Hans did some checking and is good
 with the names. However if you are okay with it, I'd like to send the press release out right after AFN
 (29th/30th) The concern is some of the Legislature's pics may be red flags to some of the AFN
  community, and I don't want anything to cloud or take away from an exciting announcement at AFN.
  Even though they are their pics (which would be clear in the Press Release as well as if questions came
  up), I'd rather play this safe. There is no real down-side to waiting 10 days to get this out that I can see.

 As far as Governor's appointments are concerned, folks in the native community (including some
 members of the delegation) had positive things to say particularly about Alex Tarnai of Tanana, Frank
 Woods of Dillingham, and Charlie Lean of Nome.

  I can give you specifics on the names of concern from the Legislature's pics if you like.
