             Yes!  This is awesome, great, wonderful news. Thank you! We don't want to lose you as
             Commish, but it's nice that the "light at the end of the tunnel" got closer and clearer
             for you today. Thank you!

             Dear Governor,




             As you already know, we have a new commissioner of education! It took awhile, but we're
             finally there! Mike and Lynne helped guide me through this process - they gave me good
             advice and it made a huge difference. I regret that this process took longer than
             expected, so thank you for hanging in there - it was worth it.



             Take care, BAT
