              Subject:                 Earmarks


              Fairbanks Newsminer is mischaracterizing our position and statements on earmarks - today's
              editorial is so off base that we need to submit a letter to the ed, or an op-ed, along the
              lines of our Carl Marrs response. None of us have said earmarks are what these editors
              claim we've suggested.



              John- would you rewrite the Marrs response for the Newsminer?



              Here we're trying to assist and "obey" Young and Stevens re: laying off earmark requests
              (for their own good too), and they're letting our efforts bite us in the butt. I spoke
              with Lisa about this yest at the Iditarod start, thanked her for her understanding of
              where we are on this, and had a good conversation with her saying she knows we're trying
              to do the right thing on this. We'll have lunch in two weeks when she's back up.
