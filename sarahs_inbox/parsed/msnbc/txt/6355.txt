        Hi Kyle: I realize now one of your questions yesterday was, "Since the ELECTION have you
        spent more time working in Juneau ( or elsewhere)..."



         We'd been talking about the legislative session, so I thought you were asking, "Since the
        SESSION..." And my answer was based on that wrong assumption re: leg session.



         Since being sworn in as Gov I've worked out of Juneau more than elsewhere, obviously, as
                                                                 i




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0003435

         I was in Juneau most entirely from January through end of May. Since the session ended
         I've spent more time traveling AK and working out of the Anchorage office.



           I apologize for jumping to a conclusion on what question you were asking.



          Thanks Kyle.

           Sarah
