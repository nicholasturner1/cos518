           I would hope so since it's a first family picnic but we'll double check. I'll let John
           know so he can notify Boehner.

           ok w/dps and linda perez.

           I spoke w/John and they cannot do a Sunday dinner after the Fairbanks picnic because
           they'll be returning that eve from traveling to ANWR . They'd like to do Sat . The caravan
           is available to take up Sat after Anch picnic and then we ' d overnight . Let me know if this
           is acceptable and I'll let John know.

            Can I tell Mr. Boehner's office anything about the Governor's plans for next weekend when
                                                              1

           the Boehner entourage will be in Fairbanks and on the North Slope? As I recall , the only
           remaining option for the Governor was dinner in Fairbanks on Saturday evening.



            Thanks for any information you can provide.
