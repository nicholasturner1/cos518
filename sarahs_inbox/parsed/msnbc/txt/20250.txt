              Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event info for the Morris Thompson Cultural & Visitors Center Dedication. A few
              things to be aware of

              -About 15 min . of Native dance and song will take place before first speaker, so you could arrive as late as 2:10
              p.m., if you so choose
              -Sen. Murkowski is one of the first speakers and will be leaving immediately after her remarks
              -all several hundred gathered for event will go over ceremonial 'bridge' into building ; I have marked on your hard
              copy floor plan (Kris will give to you) where you are to go, and will go over it with Melissa as well
              -1 believe every speaker in attendance either knew Morris or is related to him; as such , Cindy asked that you
              speak about the funding of the MTCVC, and put a big plug in for community involvement
              -Cindy Schumaker (Tanana Chiefs) will introduce you in the following manner.

              "Our next speaker joined the project when it was already in progress, but she stepped forward in
              a big way by including it in her capital budget. In total, the state of Alaska provided $6.1M for this
              project, and for that, we thank you Governor Palm!"

                        Thank you, Cindy. It's my honor to be here with all of you today, as we
                        celebrate Morris Thompson, a man who did so much for AK. And we
                        celebrate Fairbanks & the Interior communities, too, for coming together as
                        one on this worthy project.
                        A few months ago, I was working on the state 's budget with a highly-skilled
                        team , reviewing stacks of requests for state funding, & determining which
                        projects met the criteria . For the past 2 years , I have told communities
                        across AK that I want to see community support for projects that are
                        specific to a region ; I want to understand how projects requesting funds will
                        benefit their community long-term. You have done this in Fairbanks with
                        this beautiful Cultural & Visitors Center.
                      My budget team & I quickly became convinced that the group working on
                      this project had their community's full support. Fairbanks & the Interior
                      cared about getting this facility constructed & they worked together to make
                      it happen. You truly set an example of the power of community, one that
                      the rest of AK can look to.
                      In years to come, thousands upon thousands will meet in this building that
                      you came together to support. In it, they will find unity, understanding,
                      compromise & a way forward. And I cannot think of a better way to honor

              After you finish speaking, Cindy will wrap up with,

              "Thank you Governor Palin. Your support has helped us leverage an additional $4M in private
              support and for that we are grateful."
