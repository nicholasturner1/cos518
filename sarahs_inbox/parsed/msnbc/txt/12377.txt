            This issue will probably come up during your meeting with secretary Kempthorne. So, I
            wanted to make sure that you saw the attached material which describes the Secretary's
            response to 51 Senators , including Senators Stevens and Murkowski , who wrote him
            concerning carrying of firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.
