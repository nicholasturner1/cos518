          We can have them all ready in 30 minutes, should we just run them up to the Governor's
          office?

           The majority of legislators are there. With public - and other - participation, I would
           plan for 80.

           Great. Also - does Diane have time to bake cookies for legislators who are mtg on AGIA
           today? I could walk them over to the Terry Miller bldg where they are meeting ( see Gavel
           to Gavel ) - Kris is finding out how many folks are there so we have a count for cookies -
           if Diane has time for this. I 'll let u know the count.

          Piper's options for Thurs appointments are either 1:30 or 2pm. If that doesn't work I'm
          sure I can find other times.
