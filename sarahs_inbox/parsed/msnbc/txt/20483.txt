          rebate, AO on LNG.

          Whatever you want to do is fine with me. I have an ALMR Executive Council meeting that I
          would be doing by teleconference from 1 : 30 - 3pm here in JNU . However, if you want me to
          be in ANC for a background thing , I would then just attend this meeting in person in ANC,
          as well . Let me know . Plane is full tomorrow morning.

          It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the DPS

          budget and contract results... especially in light of how hard you all

          worked to increase funds and provide tools that DPS claimed they needed

          to do their job. Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have been

          overlooked by some.

            There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union",

          and this is unfair to you, to the whole administration, and most

          importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth- Please share

          your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on your work

          product and our committment to public safety can be countered with the

          truth. Thank you

             No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as it's not
             comforting at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who
             went to the bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th
             event that occurred while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

             Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the Governor's office computer
             folks and they went in on . Monday, August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not
             available at the time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned
             back to the house. All of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the
             department of law had asked for this. Janice

             If anyone has an answer, pls let me know asap:
             I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails
             from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer?
             And what were the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on
             whatever day it was that this occurred . Thank you
