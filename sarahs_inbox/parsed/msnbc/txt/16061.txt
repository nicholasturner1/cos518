            Kelly is also thinking of another way for this to work... She too believes that since I
            have never been there that the Barrow Mayor would really like to see me up there. That is
            true, so ask Kelly who we should make arrangements with if I do make this trip - a one-day
            trip is what we'll shoot for.

            I did let Pat know that we could not justify the cost to go to Barrow.

            He then asked if they charter the plane would you travel with them.
