                  Subject: Coverage of Veterans Day Events




                  Governor:




                 Hannah , Beth, Janice and I have worked up a schedule for the weekend that will have
                 representatives from the Governor's office at 10-12 different Veterans Day events in
                 Juneau, Anchorage, Mat-Su, Kenai, and Fairbanks.   I try to keep my e-mail traffic down and
                 don't want to bother you too much, so let me know if you are interested in occasionally
                 receiving this type of information.



                 Have a nice day.



                 Randy
