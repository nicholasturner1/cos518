I think if you can make it back here tomorrow, that is the soonest we need you. We may need you to
get some of the house Dems on board.

 Are all the lawmakers back in Juneau now, anticipating floor action? Or when do they trickle back in?

 The house has the bill on the floor schedule tonight. However, that will be subject to the pace of the
finance committee work this afternoon. Its possible the committee will drag on into the night.



 In either case, any floor action tonight will be procedural only. It is most likely that any amendments
or votes would take place Sunday.

I'm hearing the bill may actually get to the floor tonight? Should I try to get back there asap?
