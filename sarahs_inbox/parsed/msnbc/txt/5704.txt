             Mike,

             I am in Seattle in meetings with EPA through Tuesday morning . I'll be back in Juneau on Tuesday
             afternoon . As you probably already know, Kristin Ryan , our Director of Environmental Health, is very
             familiar with the Fox Spring water well and can provide whatever help and information is needed from
             DEC on this.

             Larry

              Some folks testified that they get their water only at the Fox springs and now don't know
              what they'll do for water.
