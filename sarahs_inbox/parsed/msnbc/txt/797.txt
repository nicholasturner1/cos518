  Todd - A thought just came to mind concerning this date. Frank Bailey would be able to get a hold of
  good friends here in Juneau that own Alaska Audio. They are very big supporters of the Governor and
  would probably donate the TV sets to be used. If you'd like I can ask Frank on this. Thanks, Janice
