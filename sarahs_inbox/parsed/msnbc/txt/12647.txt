           Sounds great- Sharon let's do press during this timeframe.



           Tom and Marty you're kicking butt on PTU, and everything else. So glad Clark's plea is
           validating our efforts, vindicating those who've been criticized all year for cleaning up
           the Clark/Murky corrupt cluster of oil and gas policy. You two, especially, have not
           deserved an ounce of the foolish criticism... I pray that others' eyes will be open to the
           efforts you're making towards justice.

           We have scheduled a break in the remand hearing from 11:30 to 2:00 tomorrow. Marty and I
           can both tie in from your Anchorage conf room. I will be glad to make a statement.    Safe
           travels.  Tom

           And great article about first step of PTU rehearing... I am so confident this will go
          well, driven by wisdom and protection of AK's future. Thank you

             DNR folks are tied up in the Pt Thomson hearing. I was thinking that we could

             I'm delayed again in Seattle - the coonecting flt's already gone. Won't get in til 8
           tonight, via milk run. Checking on other options, perhaps flying to Anchorage instead of
           waiting here til 3pm to try to get a seat on that next Juneau flt.



            Pls announce Steve anyway today . Have him say a few words after an intro by any DNR
          folks who may be available ? If no one ' s around then wait til tomorrow , tho I hate for
          press to know I was out of town for a day and couldnt get back in time for scheduled
          Juneau committments.
