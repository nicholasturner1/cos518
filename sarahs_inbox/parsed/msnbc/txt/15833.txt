           Governor,



          Good evening!



          Attached is a national op-ed piece that we would like your blessing on. You would be the
          author of this and it would be shopped around to national publications, beginning with the
          New York Times. The process could take a couple of weeks - it all depends on the level of
          interest and who bites. MCB will do the shopping for us with its national editorial
          contacts.



          The attached has been reviewed and rewritten by Bruce, Kurt, Tom, Pat, Marty, and me. This
          is the final version for your approval.



          Thanks,

          Meghan




                                                                1
