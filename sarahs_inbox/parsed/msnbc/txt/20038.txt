         I am making this annonymous so that whoever recieves this email and I am hoping that it is
         the governor-that she is the most worthless person I have ever met. Sadly enough that I
         feel I know much more politics than she does and I am half her age. She uses people and
         thinks shes pretty.. .how about all the makeup she puts on..... grow up and resign - YOU
         SUCK.. and i would hope you as her secretary would realize how much of child she is for
         attacking Lyda Green. Lyda Green is 10x more respected than Sarah is...if Sarah has to
         make like and attack a respectable woman who has done well for her state then she needs to
         move ASAP...
