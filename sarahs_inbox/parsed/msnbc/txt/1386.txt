Hi Todd,



Are you interested in attending the Boys & Girls Clubs summer training for their staff Wednesday,
May 21st. There will be a team-spirit contest where departments will compete in a "Pimp my
Tricycle" competition where the winner will be announced.



Here's an excerpt from the request:



"We respectfully request the First Gentleman, well-known as a snowmachine enthusiast, to ride in
one of these trikes and give a "thanks for all you do for Alaska's kids..." brief statement. It will be a
very lighthearted moment, meant staff-appreciation and a "rah rah", however we would love to invite
media to see the First Gentleman giving kudos to front-line youth workers facing a very busy
summer."



What do you think?

Thanks,

Erika

REQUEST:

Hi Erika,

Per our phone conversation, we would like to schedule a very brief (and fun!) appearance for the
First Gentleman. We are having a statewide summer training for front-line Boys & Girls Clubs staff in
Anchorage next week. On the morning of Thursday, May 22, we will be having a team-spirit contest -
and thought it would be a kick to have Mr. Palin participate. The short story is that we have
departments who have been competiting in a "Pimp my Tricycle" competition (highly inappropriate
name, but its meant for adult, fun team-building and it is a take off of the MTV show). At the general
session on Thursday, the trike's will be brought in and winner announced.

We respectfully request the First Gentleman, well-known as a snowmachine enthusiast, to ride in one
of these trikes and give a "thanks for all you do for Alaska's kids..." brief statement. It will be a very
lighthearted moment, meant staff-appreciation and a "rah rah", however we would love to invite
media to see the First Gentleman giving kudos to front-line youth workers facing a very busy
summer!

Thanks for forwarding our request --

Best regards,

Noelle

P.S. We will have staff traveling from Barrow, Kotzebue, Metlakatla and many other rural Clubhouse
communities to attend the training!
