             Subject: Dinner on Cruise Ship Mercury-May 20

           Hello Willow and Bristol. The Palin family is invited to have dinner on the Cruise Ship Mercury on May 20 at
           6:00pm. They have also invited you to bring a friend or two with you! I need to supply the birthdays and driver's
           license numbers (if you have one) of any guests. Picture ID will be needed to board the ship (I hope that doesn't
           mean Piper!). Please supply this information about your friends to me by Monday if you'd like to invite them.
            Bristol, I have your b/d but not your driver's license number. Thanks. Kari.
