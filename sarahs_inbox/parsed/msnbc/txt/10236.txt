              I don't want him taking advantage of you! If it happens again, just let me know and the
              deal is off.

             Well ...if you put it that way.. .there are a couple of things I need from you! Could you
             do something about getting the Kensington open, get the road to Juneau finished up and
             keep the Capital where it is? Other than that ...I think I am all set! (just having a
             little fun!)



             Marty

             p.s. I voted for you!

                    Hello Sarah,



                   Well, nothing like pulling out the big guns!   I guess a guy couldn 't ask for a more
             prestigious reference than the Governor of Alaska! ;-)

                    Thanks for taking the time to write.



                    Cheers,



                    Marty McKeown
