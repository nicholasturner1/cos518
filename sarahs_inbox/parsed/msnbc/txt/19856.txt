              Governor.

              Jessica has gathered up all the e-mails from everyone and has suggested an approach on handling e-
              mails. If this is acceptable, please let me know, or if you would her to automatically forward all e-mails on
              the subject to you at the end of the day, we can do that as well.

              Thanks,

              Randy

              Randy,

              We have received roughly 60 emails regarding the Governors decision to replace
              Monegan. A little over half of those emails are against the Governor's decision and the
              rest of them support her.

              We've also received 25 emails regarding the appointment of Comm. Kopp. 16 are in support
              of him and the rest are not.

              Since these Monegan/Kopp emails are continuous, I plan to print them out at the end of each
              day for you and Mike Nizich to review. If you think they need to be reviewed more often,
              please let me know. I would be happy to print them as they come.

               Thanks Randy,
