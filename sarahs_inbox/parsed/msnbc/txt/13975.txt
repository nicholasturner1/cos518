             Today's schedule is going to be packed again, without much room for budget. Janice and
             Mike- pls let people know I can NOT spend much time in these other meetings away from the
             budget- remember I fly out tomm night and I'll be making the budget decisions today. We
             need to make the rounds asap with lawmakers to communicate the pending vetoes, I'd think
             Russ will have to tap into others to help him cover everyone today and tomorrow.
