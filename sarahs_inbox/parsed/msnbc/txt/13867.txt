            Subject:                 Luncheon/press


            If it's a slow news day: Does press care about Todd's "spouses                   luncheon" over at the house
            today? For legislative spouses. I chuckle as he has to work on                   the goodie bags and menu
            items and centerpieces that Erika keeps asking him about. He's                   a good sport abput this
            duty- it's sort of unique for Alaska if anyone wants to take a                   pic of him with all the
            wives. And I think two husbands will attend.



            Frank- free lunch if you go over there and play the piano for entertainment of the ladies.
            Noon.
