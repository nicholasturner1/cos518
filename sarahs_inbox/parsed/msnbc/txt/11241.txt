               No, Steve I don't agree. You think because the governor was able to give a speech yesterday it should excuse
               the behavior of the Legislature. I disagree. The governor should not be accused of mis-communicating (again!)
               with the Legislature when she transmitted her request to them in December. John Bitney knew then that Track
               was graduating from infantry training and instead of drafting a letter to send to the Senate with the requested time
               in it he sent a letter that said 7:00 pm. The miscommunication is on behalf of the House via John Bitney.

               Furthermore, the Senate said that they were sticking with 7:00 because it was the "traditional" start time and so
               Lyda could allow time for her members to arrive in Juneau. WHY would she then propose a 4:00 pm. start time-
               how would an early time leave room for her members to file in? Then in this morning's ADN article Cockerham
               said the governor "bristled" at Lyda's implication of "accommodating her personal schedule." The governor did
               everything in her power to COMMUNICATE and ACCOMMODATE the Legislature, and she's still blamed for the
               miscommunication? Does she need to copy the media on every transmittal letter to the Legislature to show how
               well she actually communicates? I mean Steve, she's the governor. She's a natural, God-Given, communicator.
               And you, having sat down with her so many times, know how gracious she is with her time, how accommodating
               she is, and how well she articulates her message.

              Just my $.02. I respect your objectiveness, and the way you capture the essence of the governor's message in
              your articles; however, I will continue to hold your feet to the fire. I know you wouldn't expect anything less from
              me. And, I extend the same courtesy to you-if you see me inaccurately describing something, or if you think I'm
              ever off base just let me know. I can handle the constructive criticism and can stand to hear another point of
              view.

              Thanks,

              Ivy
