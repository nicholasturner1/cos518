          Subject :                Scheduling


          J- based on what you found, and others' recollections, it seems the only PSEA/Cyr request
          for any kind of meeting was one time, back during the contract negotiations. As Tibbles
          responded and is reported in the scheduling request, it was pointed out to Cyr that the
          chief of staff deemed it inappropriate to meet during negotiations so he did not end up
          meeting with Cyr, as DOA commissioner was doing so.

            Pls draft a letter to that issue, attaching the Cyr request. The purpose will be to
          correct Cyr's claim that I "cancelled meetings" with PSEA or I refused to meet with him.
          Thank you.
