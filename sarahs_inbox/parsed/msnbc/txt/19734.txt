               How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of
               them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote . We have
               made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!
                Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum
               they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past - they like
               the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.
