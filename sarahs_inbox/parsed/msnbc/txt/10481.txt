                    Subject: Drue Pearce's Replacement - PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL


                  The Department of the Interior is still trying to fill Drue Pearce's previous position as
                  Senior Alaska Advisor to the Secretary. There is a strong rumor that Representative
                  Ralph Samuels' name has been submitted to the White House but that no action
                  has been taken because of alleged opposition from the State administration. I have
                  heard nothing about this from the White House personnel office, and they are
                  usually pretty good about checking with us on appointments that could affect
                  Alaska.

                  In these circumstances, I wanted to check with you and Mike. If you are content
                  with the current situation, I will leave it alone. However, if clarification to the White
                  House is necessary, I will do that.
