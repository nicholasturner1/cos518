            Dear Ms . Knall:



            Thank you for your email to Governor Palin regarding funding for the University of Alaska
            projects in the FY2009 capital budget.



            We will work with legislators and review each project prior to making any decision
            regarding individual projects. Public input is an important part of the budget process.
            The information you provided will be considered in our evaluation of the budget.



            Thank you again for your comments.



            Karen J. Rehfeld, Director

            Dear Governor Palin:




            I am writing to request your support of the legislature approved funding for repair and
            maintenance of University of Alaska buildings, for the UAA Health Sciences Building, and
            for planning and site preparation for an athletic facility at UAA. These projects are
            critical to the health and well being of UAA, to the health and well being of the students
            and to the health and well being of. the State of Alaska. Alaskans need the best trained
            and educated workforce. To accomplish this goal, the University of Alaska Anchorage needs
            the legislature approved funding for these projects.
