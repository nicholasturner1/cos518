          Governor Palin:



          Although    I am not one of your constituents, I saw a little news blip on Yahoo that you
          recently    welcomed a new child into your home. I know that Trig will be an amazing
          blessing    to you and your family. In 1998, my wife and I welcomed our third child, a son,
          who also    has Down Syndrome.



          Jared has been, and every day continues         to be, an amazing blessing to our familyl
          Congratulationsll
