          Janice is sched the stevens mtg, so i cc-ed her in that last email. She can let u know
          what the sched looks like. (It's packed, but we need to talk about veco). Hopefully after
          your mtg with mike we haven't backtracjed on the need to do the state's part in cleaning
          things up- but we'll talk about that tomorrow.

         Dear Governor Palin, I don't know when your "Stevens meeting" is but I will be where you
         want me to be. Just have someone tell me the time and I will plan on being there. Talis

          Dear Governor Palin,

                 I just had a meeting with Mr . Tibbles about the VECO / FBI issues and I think a
          meeting with you soon would be helpful to follow up on the memo I sent you and the issues
          related to our options . I know you are out of town right now. If I could meet with you
          Friday afternoon I think it would be helpful .  Maybe 2 : 00 pm? Talis
