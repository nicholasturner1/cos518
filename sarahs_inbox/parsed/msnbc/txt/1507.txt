I called 411, got it, left her a message that at least TODD worked his butt off for preparation and
participation in their pageant. Between that letter this morning, Rosanne's lack of enthusiasm to
correct it (even suggesting KRIS do it), I've already begun "one of those days", so I'll shift gears here
a bit and focus on other things;

Janice- I still seem to be way behind in getting accurate emails and contact info into my blackberries.

 I call Sharon, I get Mark Kelsey; I email LeDoux, I get a kodiak school district old account; I don't
have Deputy #s plugged in (like Glass), etc. This week let's have delegated to one of the Juneau
receptionists that task and she can make sure they're all plugged in.
