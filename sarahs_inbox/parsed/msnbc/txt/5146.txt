             Governor,

             During your meeting with Drue Pearce, following the discussion with

             Admiral Thomas Barrett, she mentioned a federal grand jury probe of the

             BP pipeline corrosion matter and assumed you had been briefed on the

             matter.     All members of your administration noted we were unaware of

             this probe and you requested I investigate and advise you and

             Commissioner Hartig, DEC, of what I found.



             I did follow-up with the Dept of Law (DOL) and met significant unease

             with my inquiry. I finally discerned that, while DOL may have heard

             something about the issue, and there are reports related to requests for

             documents that strongly suggest that such an inquiry is occurring., they

             have no real knowledge nor any official confirmation of that fact.



             I did learn that a state Environmental Prosecutor in the Criminal

            Division's Office of Special Prosecutions and Appeals has been cross

             designated as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney to assist with an

             investigation of the BP pipeline corrosion matter, and he is doing so.

            However, I was advised that federal law precludes him from discussing

            this investigation with anybody, including his superiors, your

            Commissioners and yourself.



            I requested that this information be provided to me in an e-mail so I

            could convey it to your office.

            That e-mail follows. If you would like me to pursue this further,

            please advise.

            Marty R

            As requested.

            You stated that you were requested to pull together a briefing for the

            Governor and other high level state officials regarding any federal

            grand jury probe of the BP pipeline corrosion matter and you asked if I

            could assist in assembling that information .                I have spoken to both the

            civil and criminal attorneys in the Department of Law who are involved

            in the corrosion matter and can tell you the following. First, the

            existence of a federal grand jury review of the BP pipeline corrosion

            problem is widely rumored and there are reports in the public domain,

            particularly related to requests for documents, that strongly suggest

            that this is occurring.            However, I am not aware of any official

            confirmation of that fact and no information specifically regarding a

            grand jury review has been provided to the Civil Division of this

            Department or generally to the Criminal Division. I can tell you that
                                                                     2




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0000106

             the Environmental Prosecutor in the Criminal Division ' s Office of

             Special Prosecutions and Appeals has been cross designated as a Special

             Assistant U.S. Attorney to assist with an investigation of the BP

             pipeline corrosion matter and he is doing so. However ,             Federal Rule of

             Criminal Procedure 6(e) specifically precludes him from discussing this

             investigation with anybody ,      including myself, his superiors and those

             individuals you described.        in light of this , we are unable to provide

             you with the information you requested .        Please contact me if you would

             like to discuss this further.
