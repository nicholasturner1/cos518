              What is with Ramras? And don't even get me started on Neuman!!! I can't believe he's
              flip flopping-at least the other NOs are sticking by there vote. The bill hasn't changed
              at all but now he's miraculously a "yes." Give me a break. I'm still mad about his
              original no.
