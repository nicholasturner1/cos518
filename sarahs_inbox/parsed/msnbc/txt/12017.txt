             Thanks so much! I'm having a ball - thanks to you and some of the most amazing Alaskans
             I've ever met . We're thankful you've chosen public service at this time in your life.
             Thank you!

             Governor,

             I didn't get an opportunity to say Happy Birthday to you yesterday, in person. However, I
             know today is your actual birthday and I just hope you are able to have a bit of fun. So
             HAPPY BIRTHDAY and thank you so very much for sharing your life with Alaskans, and for
             being such a wonderful Governor who puts Alaska first!

             God bless you!

             Marty
