              Hello Governor and Todd,

              I wanted to let you know that staff will be arriving at the House tomorrow morning at 7 :30am. We have people
              arriving to set-up starting at 8:00am. I will have them be as quiet as possible.

              My apologies!
              Erika

             Sharon- don't answer until I hear back from Nizich, Barnhill, et al. Hopefully they gave you some
             talking points already today. Thanks
             And I don't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it, so please pass this email on
             to him before Sharon returns ADN's call. Thanks
