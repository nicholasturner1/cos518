             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list that Mike compiled
             re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership screwed over and replaced with much
             less important earmarks. I am ready to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely
             unacceptable and outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can
             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
