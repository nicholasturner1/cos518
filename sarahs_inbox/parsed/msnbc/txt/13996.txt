             Shoot- I don't have any openings either. I'll be working on the budget, and the Leg. mtgs
             are wrapped up now.

             Governor - Senator Huggins office just called and would like to have the

             1:00 p.m. meeting today. We had taken it off due to being to late in

             the afternoon.        They stated that if the 1:00 p.m. time slot did not work

             that they would then cancel all together. They have no other openings

             as they will be on the floor. Janice

             budget . Janice and Mike - pls let people know I can NOT spend much time

             in these other meetings away from the budget- remember I fly out tomm

             night and I'll be making the budget decisions today . We need to make the

             rounds asap with lawmakers to communicate the pending vetoes, I'd think

             Russ will have to tap into others to help him cover everyone today and

             tomorrow.
