               Re: Lower Kasilof boat launch, FY2009 Governors Capital Budget Appropriation Department of
               Fish and Game proposal #44823, included in HB311 & SB256

               Honorable Governor Palin:

               I'm writng this letter in strong oposition to funding of the boat launch at Eds Kasilof seafoods on
               the kasilof river in F&G proposal #44823 (boat launch) as in SB256 and HB311. Where is the
               public process? I see notices about meetings for the johnson lake recreational site & this site has
               been there for a long time but nothing about this NEW project in my backyard. I'm a 28 year
               resident of Coal Creek Country Estates, the peace & tranguility has been greatly diminished with
               the increase in activity in past years from the Eds Kasilof boat ramp traffic. I can hardly imagine
               a full fledged facility next door. In my opinion the state hasen't had a stellar record when it
               comes to creating situations and monitering and dealing with the problems it makes. Case in
               point are the mouths of the Kasilof & Kenai rivers.

               Thank you for your time
