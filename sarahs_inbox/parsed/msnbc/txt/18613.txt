         It is a courtesy call to inform you of their reductions in workforce as a consequence of
         the permitting delays. He also wants to convey their long-term commitment to being in
         Alaska.  There is work they will do this winter, but it won't require the same level of
         employees.

         and DNR have really gone to bat for them, but we've only gotten grief for our efforts. Is
         Shell calling to ask for additional assistance?
