         The roll out needs to include confirming our budget position : if a project or service is
         not a state responsibility , we don ' t fund it on top of our priority list ... because we're
         going to increase muni rev sharing so that the local communities may prioritize for their
         projects and services out of that muni rev sharing allocation.

        Cabinet meeting on Friday, 9/28? Mike wants to notify commissioners but wanted to confirm
        first . The objective will be a "big picture " roll-out.
