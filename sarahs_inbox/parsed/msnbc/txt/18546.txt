         Subject:                  Re: Op ed


          I emailed the editor last night to ask "when". i anticipate he'll say "now".



         The additional info that needs to be included in an op - ed may have to written into someone
         else's op - ed, like one from Galvin or Tom ... my 675 words are all that ' s allotted by adn.
         Dr Anthony Scott may be one to pen a follow - up op - ed also.



         Instead of waiting any longer , at least my op-ed needs to get out there asap ... we can't
         "over strategize " our points , meanwhile sitting on our points that the public needs to
         hear . Mine is purposefully simple because that ' s what ' s been missing in our public
         talking points so far.



         So- hopefully I'll hear back today (between my events ) any short suggested edits coming
         from the team , and I'll need that $ amt plugged in to the piece , then it ' s out the door
         with everyone ' s short suggestions on how to make the piece better. Waiting a week to have
         something published after a big announcement is really pushing it - so we won't wait
         longer than we already have.



         Sean also has offered to pen an op - ed. Maybe his could include whatever additional points
         you guys came up with that can't fit into my 675 word piece . Thanks!

         Governor,

          I'll have a draft of suggested edits to you later today . We had a strategy meeting friday
         afternoon / evening and I think we need to include some of that information into your
         remarks.

                                                                 1

         Kris- were you able to get the op_ed to this team? Unless I soon receive suggested
        changes/edits I'll just wait for the blank $ amount to be plugged in to the piece and then
        I'll ask ADN to run it. Then we'll submit to other publications after hearing from ADN.
