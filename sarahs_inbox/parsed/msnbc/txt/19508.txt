          This is crazy pricing! It's getting outrageous in Alaska, too. In most urban areas it's
          nearing $5.00/gallon. And in our rural areas it can be as high as $10.00.

             We're really trying to ramp up production of our safe, domestic supplies of energy that
          Alaska has plenty of. Please tell everyone to support our efforts to drill, pump and
          produce more energy from our Alaskan resources.

          When Eloy and I went to Pohnpei in January of this year, the price of gasoline was already
          $4.00 a gallon. Today, it's $6.20 per gallon and still going up.
