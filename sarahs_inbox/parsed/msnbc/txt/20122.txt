           Subject:                 Talking Points re: TransCanada's work schedule and LNG committments


           Governor,  The team assumes you will be asked questions about TransCanada's intentions
           regarding their summer work schedule and their LNG committments. Therefore I asked
           TransCanada to give us some talking points for you to use when asked. These are below:



           TransCanada is highly motivated to maintain the Alaska Gas Line project schedule, as are
           Alaskans, to ensure Alaska gas is moved to markets as quickly as possible.



           TransCanada will make a decision regarding initiating activities prior to License issuance
           in the next week.



           Initial work by TransCanada will include: aerial photography and satellite imagery

           on the route specifics; environmental gap analysis; Alaska office selection and set

           up; and continued work with potential customers to seek alignment.



           Estimated expenditures from the initiation of activities through June 2009 are $54M. An
           estimated cumulative total of $84M will be expended through the Open Season planned to
           conclude at the end of July 2010.



           In that initial open season customers will have the opportunity to nominate

           delivery points along the pipeline route in Alaska, in Yukon, BC, to the Alberta

     i     Hub or to Valdez.



           All prospective customers will have to meet standard conditions (gas availability,
           creditworthiness, etc.) regardless of their delivery point.



           TransCanada will complete the same preparatory work (field, engineering,

          environmental and commercial) for Valdez as we will for deliveries elsewhere in Alaska or
          to Alberta.



           Subject to regulatory approvals and all customer requirements, if sufficient

          volumes are contracted to Alberta and Valdez, TransCanada will build for both; if

                                                                 1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0022404

           only sufficient to Alberta, then that pipe will be built; if only sufficient to

           Valdez, then the pipe to Valdez would be built.



           We hope these are useful.

           Marty
