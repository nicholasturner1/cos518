                Dear Governor Palin,
                    Just so you know . The US Supreme Court just issued an order denying the plaintiffs request that our lawyer
                be allowed to participate in the oral argument before the Court on Feb. 27. This was relayed to us by the attorney
                we had hired to do that argument . Therefore, our input will be limited to the amicus brief (you have a copy). Talis
