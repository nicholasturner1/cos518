                Subject: Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives

              Just wanted to let you know that the Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives (H&SS)
              and the FBCI Advisory Council have been extremely active in pulling together Alaska faith
              leaders to strategize and implement ways to get more families involved in being foster families.
              Scott Merriner has done a good job of pulling the effort together and Jay Pullins in my office
              has been working with FBCI (and the Advisory Council) on this initiative.

              They're not complete yet, but making good progress.
