          Pls find out how much the rural affairs advisor position pays - dont tell mike who's being
          considered yet - he'll not like the flexibility of allowing the person being headquartered
          where they need to be most effective. Pis call rhonda and ask her to call me when
          convenient, after you know more details of pay and anything else to add. Maybe Nizich
          should be the one providing the info as tibbles may be busy.
