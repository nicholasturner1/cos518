           Subject: Kvisle quote



           There was a quote from Hal Kvisle in the Daily Globe and Mail today saying the project
           would go forward when Exxon is happy.



            It was a poor quote and even worse timing. Legislators are upset and some of our
           opponents (notably Bob Roses) are trying to stir up trouble.



            TC is getting a letter of clarification from Kvisle right now. What we have told
           legislators is that this isn't really new: everybody is going to have to be happy,
           including Exxon.
