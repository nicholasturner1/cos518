While boarding the flight last night, Rep. Gatto said to me in a very loud voice with several others
standing there, does this state care about families and the military anymore? The Governor should
just announce the time and let's just see who shows up.



Our kids often see things more clearly and get to the point quickly. I think we can learn from them.
Thanks for sharing. Tom
