             Randy,
             Within 2 weeks, Revenue will be dispersing payments for the fisheries business tax collected in 2007 . Adak's
             ballpark will be 250,000. Payments are based on tax collected, not tax owed, so any problem collecting the tax
             reduces the share to communities. I don't believe that affects this year's payment; it may reduce next year's if
             Revenue is unsuccessful in addressing the problems they've identified.
             Cora
