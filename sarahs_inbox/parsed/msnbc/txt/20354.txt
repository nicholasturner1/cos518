           MESSAGE:

           Hi, I am looking for the department website or email that would have information regarding
           housing statistics for the state of Alaska. I am particularly interested in historical
           inventory or supply (in months) of homes for sale.




           Any help would be greatly appreciated.




           Thanks,




                                                                 1
