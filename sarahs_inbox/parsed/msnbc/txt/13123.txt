           I am not falling on my sword over this- you can try again with pointing out the mistaken
           numbers being used, but I am not vetoing what they present to me, despite it not being
           complete. You can remind them one more time of the mistaken numbers, but it is up to them
           to repair. I announced yest that we believed the pkg could be made better, as we had
           rolled out, but we shouldnt have suggested we'd veto it if it wasn't corrected to reflect
           higher spending. Again, without others on the battlefield with me, we do not win, and I
           move on to the next issue.

          we have the bill transmitted from the Legislature so technically it can be signed as soon
          as you and the bill are in the same location.



          I met with Bill Thomas and Kurt Olson and asked them about the bill. I showed both of
          them the fiscal notes from the Department as well as the House Finance fiscal note. I
          pointed out that their districts would receive less under the bill than they expected.
          Neither of them were aware of the situation.



          Gary Wilken has made some progress with leadership to get a correction (probably through
          the capital budget).  His message has not had time to sink in with the Legislature as a
          whole.  The way he explains the situation is a bit confusing as well. The districts are
          starting to realize that they will not receive the amount they expected either. However,
          the Legislature has them scared that they will lose what they have it they speak out
          against the Legislature's plan.   To make progress with the districts will require getting
          some of the non-leadership members on board.

                                                                  1

          We tried to message the comments that we are disappointed and what we have now does not
          have the predictability school districts need.   Also, that we have enough time left in the
          session to work with the Legislature to improve our education funding package.

           Karen - when ' s the soonest I can sign the Educ Bill and put to rest the threat of veto
          there? I believe I was thrown under the bus on that one, after being told districts (incl
          Anchorage) were being short-changed and they did not want the $100 BSA... So I stuck my
          neck out saying we needed to send it back to fight for the $200... My understanding was
          Wilken and other legislators were going to reveal the number problems in the funding
          package two days ago and rally troops to get it fixed. My understanding of all this has
          evidently been wrong and I will not "fight" for a higher level of public school funds when
          I'm alone on the battlefield. On this one, we rolled out a great pkg (tell Eddy "thank
          you") but leggies said "no"... we tried, I'm not going to veto this and am perplexed as to
          why it seemed districts would have/should have and DID support our pkg initially, were
          curiously silent through all this, and now we 'll be bombarded with cries of "don't veto
          Education - it's for the children".

           I do feel I was thrown under the bus on this , we were used by legislators, some
          districts, and others on this, and I will not advocate for higher spending in this
          package, due to lack of support and advocacy from others.



          When's the earliest to sign- and please put to rest today any threat of veto on this...
         It's not fair to schools or leggies for them to think I ' m considering it and that we're
         playing games with this one. Thanks ... We didn ' t do a presser on this to more
         appropriately explain our position, so pls have one sent out today that explains all this
         more fully- even if it has to sound like I'm eating crow, I'd like to be clear that I'm
         not vetoing the Educ Bill and it's up to leggies to fix any numbers that were pointed out
         to them that were incorrect.

          We just completed about two hours with Kevin Meyer and Bert Stedman.

           They want to come together on an overall plan .    I told them that it was

           our interest as well. I did pass along my significant frustration that.

           I believe we did everything we could to work cooperatively with them and

           feel like we are getting nothing in return.     I mentioned false

           statements , audits attempting to dig up dirt, our bills being held up
                                                        3

           and departments getting unnecessary disrespect.        If we are going to work

           cooperatively, things need to change on their side. I think I got the

           message across and the reiterated their interest in working together.             Privileg
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           Anyway, Karen and I will be-going back over our lists tomorrow and

           seeing if we can come up with the most critical items. We would like to

           talk about our own must have list for session sometime soon in order to

           keep the overall spending down.

           Did we follow up press avail today with a press release so reporters

           would grasp more of the gist? Seems it's being reported as "we're

           forcing ... wer're calling them in to make them explain... She's

           threatening a second veto now- this time with education"....
