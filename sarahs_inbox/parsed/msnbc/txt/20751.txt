          Subject:                 Thank you!!!

          For the most wonderful note! You made my day - already.

             You are an amazing, grounded, true man of character who just happens to be working in
          govt. America needs more people just like you in service!

             Keep hunting, keep being a true Alaskan... keep calling it as you see it - we love the
          mobster in ya.

              I am so glad you were here through the kick off of this. Thank you.
