            I have checked directly with the airlines and that mid-morning flt is completely sold out.
            I am checking one more avenue and will know shortly. Janice

            Any idea if Ak Air has a seat available on the 11-ish flt today, instead of me waiting for
            the late flt I'd better get to Juneau sooner . If you could look, that'd be great. Thanks
            (I already let janice know to try finding a seat , but most time security has that
            automatic "they're full" reply)
