            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations Governor Palin on your gorgeous baby boy Trig!



            I too have had the privilege of bearing a son with Trisomy 21, and what an inspiration he
            has been to not only my family but to many others as well. I too was prediagnosed at 20
            weeks pregnant and refused an abortion at the insistence of a genetics counselor.

            I can't imagine life without him and within 2 years of life he has been featured on the
            front page of The Tennessean as a miracle and recently in IF Family Magazine as the rock
            of my family. He was featured as a miracle because of the increase in abortions nationwide
            due to prenatal testing of Trisomy 21.



            I can only imagine that God has a truly significant and perfect plan for you and your
            family, and that Trig will continue to open your eyes and allow you to think outside the
            boxes that try and draw lines around individuals with Down Syndrome.



            God Bless!
