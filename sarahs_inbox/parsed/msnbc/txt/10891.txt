            I hope you all had a chance to read the Fairbanks Daily Newsminer today. The front page
            had a good article from Dillion. The front page on the B section talks about Port
            Authority options.  I don't think we could ask for better initial comments about the Port
            Authority right after they received their news. Hope you all are having a great weekend.
              You deserve it!   God bless. Tom
