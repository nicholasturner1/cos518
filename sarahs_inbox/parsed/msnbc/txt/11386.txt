              Kyle called me to authenticate the email he received - I told him to

              send what he received - which he did. I said - funny Kyle I don't see

             your name on the email string - he laughed and said.he would not reveal

              his source.

             Sharon: Heartbreaking to know someone would have leaked my email this

             morning- Sunny said it had to have been sent to ADN within the first

             hour. I think it would do me good to ask Kyle how he received it - he

             won't tell me, but he'll know that I know how improper it is for

             internal emails to team members to be leaked to reporters.
