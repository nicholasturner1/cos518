            Well, for starters , we need to clamp down on these email leaks to the media that we are
            having to continually react to. We 'll put our heads together today on messaging.

            Thanks, again, Harris...

            Wonder what he thinks he accomplishes with these kinds of constant messages (all
            negative)?

            We need to get out ahead of this one before the announcement is made next week. As
            Heyworth has pointed out, Harris' tactic does nothing but set up an ugly and dramatic
            showdown between Hickle and our other friends - and me - leading up to next week's
            announcement.

            Comm Dept: what's the strategy here so we're not just in a reactionary mode as Harris, et
            al, creates some build up for a potential showdown?

             Politicians look east for natural gas customers

             by Mike Ross

             Monday, May 12, 2008

             ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A delegation of Alaska political figures is just back from a trip to
             China. Their mission was to find out if there ' s a market for Alaska natural gas in the Far
             East.

             They say they'll use what they found out to put pressure on Gov. Sarah Palin in the
             upcoming battle over the gas pipeline project.

             The group included former Gov. Wally Hickel and House Speaker John Harris, who says the
             trip convinced him even more that an all-Alaska gas line is the best choice.

             "Alaskans would benefit more by that, by being able to sell their gas to'those folks at a
             higher price than we could sell it to the United States," Harris said.

             The Alaska political figures met in Beijing with leaders of China's giant energy company
             Sinopec and in Tokyo with representatives of Mitsubishi Corporation, Tokyo Electric and
             Tokyo Gas.

             Harris says the message was the same at each stop -- the Far East is clamoring for Alaska
             natural gas.

            "We came away with the feeling, and I think they' re gonna be writing it down in a letter
            to the governor, that they would take all the gas we could provide as soon as we could
            provide it in the form of liquefied natural gas," Harris said.

            Harris says Gov. Hickel hopes to meet with Gov. Palin soon to discuss the China trip and
            to push again for an all-Alaska pipeline project that could ship liquefied, gas to domestic
            and foreign markets.

            "Many people voted for this governor based upon the fact they thought she was gonna be an
            advocate for an all-Alaska gas line ," Harris said . " That doesn ' t seem like that 's the case
            now."

            The Palin gas line team says the bid from TransCanada for a pipeline to the Lower 48 was
            the only proposal to meet the requirements of the governor's Alaska Gasline Inducement
            Act, or AGIA.

            "We've said all along that (liquefied natural gas) needs to be looked at closely before we
            can make a decision on the TransCanada license," Revenue Commissioner Patrick Galvin said.
            "It has been a significant part of the analysis."

            Galvin is a member of the governor's gas line team and says the all-Alaska route is still
            being reviewed.

            "We believe that we're taking a look very even -handedly at all issues and we want to make
            sure our decision is one that goes to maximizing the benefits of Alaskans," Galvin said.
            "We're leaving the door open for all options."

            Harris says after making the trip, he believes Alaska's energy future lies in the Far
            East, not across the Canadian prairie.

            "I think a project that goes through Alaska and provides gas for Alaskans and provides
            jobs for Alaskans and not Canadians is the best way to go," he said. "That fight will
            place in another few days."

            The Palin administration is scheduled to announce next week if it will recommend the
            TransCanada bid. State lawmakers are due back in Juneau for a special session on the gas
            line project early next month.
