       Could you please send me information about moving to Alaska. It has been a life-long
       dream of mine, and I would like to know where to start. At the current time I do not have
       internet access.  The only online use is through my public library. Anything you could
       send me that would make my families relocation to your great state would be most
       appreciated.  Our address is: Al & Diane Wicke 227 E. Sheridan Rd. Lansing, MI 48906.
       Thank You!
