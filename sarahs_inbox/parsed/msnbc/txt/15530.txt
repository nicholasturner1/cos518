           Jerry Beale was suppose to read proclamation on your behalf and should have been at event
           with it.  I even talked with Gen. Campbell who had spoken earlier to Jerry at ANC event.
           I had been trying to locate Jerry this afternoon and have not been able to - Janice

           Not sure what happened - I waited til the last minute and no proclamation showed up... so
          to improvise the me found a poem, handed it to me, I took a chance and read-it instead of
          the missing proclamation (which was noted on the printed agenda that the Gov's
          Proclamation would be read) - let's hope it didn't offend vets or military personnel who
                                                                   1

            Governor - just talked with McHugh and he will give Jerry a heads up that you will be at
           the 1:00 Wall to read Proclamation. Jerry has Proclamation and will be on the lookout for
           you.  Janice

           I'd be at Wall ceremony to read proclamation. I'll look for Jerry Beale or whomever has
           the proc at the 1pm ceremony.
