             Do I know the person? I'm wondering if I'm missing something with this request from
             Janice.

             I talked w/Janice and they were hoping for a phone call to him. I will

             get his number and have it for you tomorrow in case you call (unless you

             need sooner). We will send a condolence letter.

             Janice said his adult nephew died last week, another Rep has asked if we

             contacted him- so if we haven't done a card for him yet would you print

             one out and send to Joule? Thank you
