           You're awesome John - thanks for all this good info.



           Dare    I say I'm excited about trying to tackle subsistence ? I don't want to get shot by my
           good    colleagues for saying so - but I'm anxious to add this challenege to our docket. I
           look    forward to hearing more about the previous steps taken that coulda'shoulda' led to
           some    success.



           Thank you!

           legal counsel . Right now , we are looking at a = tripartite solution that involves a
           general disclaimer , Alaska specific = language , and legislative history.

           * The House SubCommittee Chairman and the BLM swear that they are not = trying to change
           existing policy . The SubCommittee Chair has told = Congressman Young that he will do
           whatever is necessary to address our = concerns . So, I am optimistic at the moment.

           * We will continue our efforts in coordination with the Congressional            = delegation, BLM,
           Alaska Miners Association , and Doyon.



           * Section 8 ( a) Contracting



           * It sounds like this discussion went well .  We will stay in = contact with the Native

           * This could be a tough fight in the Senate, but the program is = important enough to

           * Subsistence



           * I don ' t claim to have the "Silver Bullet" either , but I ' d like to help = you think
           through the issues at the appropriate time .   Perhaps, it = should disqualify me, but I've
           worked on various permeations of this issue = since 1969.

           * The closest the State ever came was a tripartite solution = involving an amendment to
           the State Constitution and revisions = to State and Federal statutory law. Even this
           approach incurred the = wrath of people at each end of the subsistence spectrum.
           Unfortunatel = y, many rural people now seem to favor federal management.

           * The Alaska Congressional delegation usually says that they won't act = at the federal

           of the Interior have seen subsistence = as the third rail of Alaska politics and have been

           * None of this is said to discourage you but to restate the obvious .&nbsp= ; That is, it
           will take a truly concerted effort ( and, as you said, = perhaps Devine intervention) to
           move the parties toward a solution.

           * I wish the Alaska Supreme Court would decide the manning case .          = This could help in
           reframing the issue.




           It sounds like you had a really good meeting with the Native - leaders.
