         Kari - pls forward to Linda Perez:



         Am I supposed to be charging meals while I am away from Juneau? or does per diem cover my
         meals - I haven't charged any meals to the state, just a couple of coffees while outside
         during these six months in office. Am I doing this right?



         What about Todd's meals if he's traveling for First Gentlemen duties? Is the intent for
         his per diem to cover meals entirely, or was he to have been keeping receipts for
         reimbursements? What about family?



         I'd like to be real clear especially going into July where we've been asked if we can be
         away from Gov's House during renovations.



         Thanks Linda- sorry to bug you about policy I'm still not clear on.



         Thanks! SP
