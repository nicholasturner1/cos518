             I will incorporate these changes into our press release as the Dept. of

             Ed is not sending one tonight. Will send out to media here shortly.

            Do you approve of this quote from yourself:


          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I'm working on getting this statement to the Dept . of Ed.               ( Tibbles is

            tracking this down right now ).          If their presser isn't ready , we have a

            draft we can get out.
