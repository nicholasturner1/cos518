           Hi guys! Checkin in. I anticipate folks will be inquiring about our polar bear issue,
           though it hasnt cropped up yet that I've heard of..

             Climate change is a top issue of course. Just head's up. Also, predator control's been
           quiet, but let me know if the issue's volume gets turned up and I need to respond to
           anything. Thanks guys! Hang in there... I appreciate you sincerely.
