           And when will this be messaged to the punlic so they'll know we did NOT increase our
           requests up to the 23 - 27 percent increase some are claiming?

           Subject: More Budget Analysis




           We are continuing to refine the analysis of the budgets - attached is a two - page workbook
           - the first tab is basically what I sent this morning with minor tweaks in the FY08
           Governor Column and the second tab is a comparison of the FY08 starting point to the FY09
           Governor ' s Amended budget and the FY08 starting point to the FY09 Legislature ' s budget - I
           was trying to get to Rep . Chenault's statement about a 23 % increase.  You can get there if
           you back the supplemental amount out of our December starting point.




           However, we did not include tax credits in our spending numbers - so , you will see on the
           bottom of page 2, a GF comparison without tax credits .  We had a 4% overall GF increase in
           December and ended up with a 7. 2% increase - largely due to the adjustments for the
           bargaining unit agreements , and a couple of large capital requests , $12.5 million for
           erosion and $8 million for the bullet line.
                                                                    1
