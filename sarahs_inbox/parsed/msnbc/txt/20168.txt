              I don't remember if I met him. If u can't reach julie pls ask someone else on format so I don't plan
              a speech to be read, instead of just sitting there chatting into a mic at a roundtable setting thanks

              Governor,

              I have a call in to Julie Kitka and hope to hear back soon. Because an estimated 90 people are supposed to
              attend, I would expect a podium.

              Also, I was trying to verify that you knew, or had met with, Dr. Gary Sobeloff? Tlingit leader? I thought
              you had, but Janice didn't see it in your schedule.

              Is this a speech at a podium, or roundtable discussion (meaning no speech)?

              Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event info. I'm still waiting on feedback for the remarks from several in your Juneau
              office, so there may be changes yet, as Janice may have mentioned. I've told them I need to get the remarks to
              you as early this evening as possible. I've reworked the remarks, integrating several comments from Rhonda
              McBride. I will have Tara print your speech off on cards for you tomorrow morning, as I have jury duty first thing.
              Yay for civic responsibility© Anyway, I'll get updated remarks to you ASAP, and please do not hesitate to let me
              know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

              Thank you!

              P.S. Senator Inouye's (HI) last name is pronounced "ih-no-way."
