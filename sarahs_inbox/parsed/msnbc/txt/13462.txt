            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations to you and your family on the birth of your son! I have a nine month old
            daughter who has Down Syndrome which we didn't know until she was born . We feel truly
            blessed that she chose our family to be born into, as we do our older son. God bless you
            and your family!  Juliet Van Scoyk
