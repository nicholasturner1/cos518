        Governor Palin,




        Ivy Frye contacted me yesterday on your behalf and requested my input on the Kenai
        Superior Court vacancy.   I apologize for not commenting on this judgeship earlier, as I
        have familiarity with the candidates and am convinced that one of them is (by far) the
        most qualified for this position.
