           Governor - Please see guest list for dinner below. Also, Cora sent these comments.
           Thanks, Janice



           Dinner tonight begins with cocktails @ 6:30 with seating and serving at 7. Everyone will
           sit at one table and we should be done by about nine. They have crayons, etc. for Piper
           if she wants to come and have seated her between the Governor and a board member who has
           five kids at home to make it fun for her. There shouldn't be many heavy issues. They
           will be presenting her with a framed copy of an ad featuring her and each board member
           will be speaking very briefly about what their company is working on. They will probably
           bring up the budget. The Governor has included GF for ASMI for the first time in many
           years.  She put in one million last year, but the legislature cut it to 500k. We put in
           750k this year, still waiting to see what the legislature does.
