             Pls let me know when NGA confirms summer mtg dates . I'm going to try again this year with
            getting the kids there for First Family events - it didn ' t work last yr so we ' ll need as
            much advance notice as possible to secure good airfares and availabilities . We'll probably
            use mileage for the kids ' tickets if Alaska doesn ' t fund First Family travel for NGA
            annual mtg . This necessitates even earlier reservations.



             Pls let me know dates and airports in the vicinity. Driving from a less-expensive airport
            arrival into Penn may be necessary ... everything's going to depend on family ticket
            prices. Thanks
