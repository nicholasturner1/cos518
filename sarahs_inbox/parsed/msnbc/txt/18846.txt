               Subject:    Pat, Tom, Marty Op-ed - For Quick Turn Around
               Importance: High
              Attached is a draft op-ed from Tom, Marty and me on the gross vs . net issue.

              We'd like to get this out ASAP following H. French's hints of dissention in the
              ranks.

              Please review and get any edits to Beth Leschper by 4:30 today, if possible.
              Beth will put together edits and provide us and the Governor with a version to
              bless before it is submitted.

              Sorry for the quick turn around. Thanks.

              -Pat
