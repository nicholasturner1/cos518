             Thank you. I am headed to Sen Huggins as we speak. Hopefully an energy pkg will be done by Tuesday.

             I'll keep you posted. Right now the House and Senate do not have agreement on final bill.

             Good morning Governor,

             The energy team is working with the House and Senate Finance C ere are many elements being
             discussed at the table and the committees now want the Administration 's position with the goal of moving
             a bill out this afternoon.

             Right now there is an expansion of PCE
             A subsidy for bulk home heating fuel over $3.00 per gallon up to 600 gallons administered by AEA
             A rebate check - no dollar determined yet between $250 and $1000



             9/18/2009

              LIHEAP & income based public assistance for heating costs

              Only the H version includes the Scents motor fuel suspension right now.
              We will obviously work to encourage a rebate check of at least $800, trying for higher if possible. We will continue
              for fuel tax suspension but no sure Senate will agree.

              We need to work with the committees very soon and Randy will need to have a comment at the table later today.

              Thanks, Kelly

              leave the office for Alaska. Do you know yet whether Governor Patin will
              be able to speak for us? If not, when could we expect a response?

              I am sure you are not surprised to know that folks around here are
              excited at the prospect of meeting the Governor.

             Please do copy in my assistant Mary Jo Von Ewegen on any correspondence,
             in case I am already out of the office (I copied Mary Jo on this
             message). I am not sure how well-connected I will be in Denali.

             Thanks again for your help with this.

             Dear Janice: Thanks again for speaking with me today . We hope Governor
             Patin will be able to speak to the Hillsdale College cruise group.

             Here is a link to the cruise itinerary:

             http://www.rssc.com/voyage/details.isp?code=MARQ80730

             We would like the Governor to address our group in Juneau on August 2,
             when the ship pulls in at 1 p.m.

            Alternatively, if that is simply not possible , our group will be in
            Anchorage on the evening of July 26 for the start of our pre-cruise land

             when the ship pulls in at 1 p.m.

            Alternatively, if that is simply not possible, our group will be in

             Janice : Sorry to bother you again, and on a Saturday mousing, too. I have also left you a voice mail message on your cell
             phone.

             Our president, Larry Arnn, has asked me to inquire whether the Governor would be willing to meet privately with him and
             members of our board of trustees , following her presentation to the Hillsdale cruisers.

             The small group would be about 10-15 folks.

             We have arranged for a room here on the ship for this private meeting, which would be very informaL

             Could you call my cell phone and let me know? We're cruising Tracy Arm right now, but its a strong signal as of now. Cell
             is 517-610-1386.

             Again, sorry to bother you on a Saturday.
