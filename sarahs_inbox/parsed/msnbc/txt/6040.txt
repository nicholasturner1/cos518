         Sounds good IVY! Glad he'll fit - he's got a lot to offer. It's sunny here - but we're
         knee-deep in budget so can't feel the sun on our shoulders today. Enjoy the day!

        Dan is in town today and tomorrow. He's going to be great. Thank you both for brining
        him into the office. We're on the same page in terms of making good appointments, getting
        people plugged in, reaching out to supporters, diversifying regionally, etc. He'll bring
        a lot of knowledge in terms of drafting press releases , making contacts at community
        meetings and luncheons, reaching out to different constituencies, etc. It'll be good.



        Thought I' d share.
