          Governor:



          Should I also try to schedule a meeting with Acting Commissioner Glass

          for a status report, discussion of issues related to the department for

          Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday?

          It's looking like a wednesday cab mtg in Juneau is best for folks'

          schedule . We'll have it as a long lunch at the house, nothing fancy... a

          working lunch . I'm standing by to hear if there ' s onjection . to this- or

          a better suggestion by cabinet members.
