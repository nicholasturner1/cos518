         Nice job, governor!  You picked some great board members. I hope you made it back to
         town--the weather is ridiculous.



         Any day you want the tour/introduction/guest page gig for Track and Britta will be fine.

         I just wanted to let you know what GREAT additions Joanne Smith and

         Beth Farnstrom are to the Board of Nursing!                  They joined us for the

         first time at our meeting last week in Juneau. Both of these women

         contributed valuable input and insight, even at their first meeting!

         I am truly looking forward to their contributions in the future.

         Thanks so much for the great choices in appointments.
