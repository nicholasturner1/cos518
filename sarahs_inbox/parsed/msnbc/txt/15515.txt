             Governor - I just received word that Time Magazine wants to not cancel if you are still
             available at 11:00 a.m. (AK Time). This would fit with your schedule as the Bill Signing
             today could not be changed to an earlier time as Senator Wielechowski is touring
             Correctional Facility.  The Bill Signing is at 2:30 p.m. Janice
