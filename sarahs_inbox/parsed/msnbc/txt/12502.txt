            MESSAGE:

            Greetings Gov. Palin,




            It is reported that you may run for VP on the Republican ticket. That would be great. You
            seem to be a warm and caring

            person by your photos. You have our prayers and support.

            Just remember. The convservative revolution started by

            President Reagan reinstituted a culture of life, liberty

            and the pursuit of happiness under God. Let's reach His

           and his goals.



           Thanks for listening.
