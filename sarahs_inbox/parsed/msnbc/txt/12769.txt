             Governor-



             I talked with Sean Cockerham today regarding Randy Reidrich. He wanted to know what your
            relationship was w/him. I told him there was no relationship. I also told him that you
            favored a change in leadership.



             He would like to ask you more questions. I told him you had a full day and didn't promise
            anything. But just in case 2574344. Thanks
