            Tom: an aside- but surely Clark's plea vindicates us with oil/gas efforts? We inherited
            such a clustered up tainted, corrupt mess. It's such a gross thing to consider that this
            recent revelation is probably just the tip of the ice berg re: Clark and Murky's
            activities. I just read a list of Murky's campaign fundraisers/treasurers... The list
            itself tells such a story.



            The list speaks to other tainted issues like CON, fisheries and ethics reform efforts and
            why we feel we're beating our heads against the wall some days. It also makes one even
            more curious about the motivation of some of the Mukry hanger-on-ers in Juneau... many
            whom I still don't know well enough to be able to trust.



            Just thinking out loud - and sharing with you how much I appreciate all of you and your
            kick butt work for Alaska!!!

            We have scheduled a break in the remand hearing from 11:30 to 2:00 tomorrow. Marty and I
            can both tie in from your Anchorage conf room. I will be glad to make a statement.    Safe
            travels.  Tom

              I'm delayed again in Seattle - the coonecting flt's already gone. Won't get in til 8
            tonight, via milk run. Checking on other options, perhaps flying to Anchorage instead of
            waiting here til 3pm to try to get a seat on that next Juneau flt.



              Pls announce Steve anyway today. Have him say a few words after an intro by any DNR
            folks who may be available? If no one's around then wait til tomorrow, tho I hate for
            press to know I was out of town for a day and couldnt get back in time for scheduled
            Juneau committments.
