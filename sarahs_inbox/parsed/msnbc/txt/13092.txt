          When are we going to start countering the bs that is out there about our budget? For
          instance Dan Fagan's insistance that we hired 1000 new state employees, his insistance
          that Doogan crunched numbers to show this is a 27-percent increase in state budget, that
          we're intiminating lawmakers to come into our office, etc etc etc. ??? His show is
          pathetic, the lies he's spewing. This is the first I've heard his show in, forever, and
          can not believe this is the stuff he believes and is telling Alaskans? Unless we at least
          factually counter SOME of his lies, Alaskans will believe his rhetoric... again, if
          there's no truthful information to correct him, what information do they have to go on?
