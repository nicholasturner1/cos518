            Thanks! And of course I'm happy to talk to him, just want to make sure he's got some
            preliminary answers to whatever ' s bothering him before I contact him.

            Right. Too many people have my account now, so I 'm telling others to go through the
            website . You can try asking him for list of issues ( or give to Randy - it'sIPnV!I elated,
            Kristine Klein can help ), maybe he ' ll communicate with others before he co      s me again.

            Governor - you asked that this email be forwarded to you. If you'd like I can ask that
            they list the issues so that you are not giving them direct access to your account.
            Thanks, Janice
