           Message:Dear Governor Palin,




           I'm not one of you bigger fans. I think you've probably missed the boat badly on the gas
           line and I'm not impressed by some of the people around you.



           HOWEVER, unlike other politicians in both parties you do appear genuinely to appreciate
           the value of a dollar. MORE POWER TO YOU for your vetos of foolish capital, projects and
           other unwise and unnecessary sprending.  Keep it up and stick to your guns.
