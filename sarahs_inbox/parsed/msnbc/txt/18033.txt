              I agree with you that we can do more of the public relations work ourselves. I
              also believe that such work is essential if we are to succeed on national issues
              like ANWR and oil and gas development generally.

              I've learned from bitter experience that being right on the merits is sometimes
              not enough. I'd like to think that Alaska is almost always correct on the
              merits.

              However, for better or worse, modern public policy seems to have a significant
              political component. Many times members of Congress have told us that we
              are right on the merits but that our opposition represents the margin of
              winning or losing in their home states.

             In my opinion, the challenge is to remove Alaska issues from the context of
             being an easy environmental vote. In a proper way, members should
             understand that there are other consequences in a world of high gasoline
             prices and insecure foreign sources of oil and natural gas.

             At bottom, I think Tom Kizzia's problem ma_y be with the use of public funds
             for any public relations program. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                 I just read Tom Kizzia's story in today's ADN. I think it was fair and balanced to
                 all con cerned. In my opinion, our administration came out just fine, and Tom's
                 portrayal of PAC/West was also even-handed.

                 There's an old axiom in DC to the effect that, when in doubt, tell the truth. We
                 did, and Governor Palin's decision to freeze the contract became the principal
                 story line.

                 I'd be interested to know what you think. Meg, it was good to work with you and

            Governor,

            One of our board members (Alaska Home Educators Alliance) spoke with Roger
            Sampson, and he indicated that noone had asked him to revisit the 2004
            regulations on Statewide Correspondence Programs. The question arose in the
            group about what was requested of him regarding the regulations.

            Have you communicated with Roger about the 2004 regulations, and that
            changes
            should be considered?

            (These regulations created inequity between the Statewide programs (IDEA,
            Cyberlinx, etc))

            Just a brief response would be great.

            God Bless you,
            Glen Biegel

            I left out one part. I understand that Shell will not be able to meet until after 3:00 pm. I agree that it would be nice
            if their schedules were more flexible. Maybe we should just have DNR attend this time around.

             Kris,

             Thanks for your offer to assist with a Shell request to meet with Gov. Palin. I apologize for the short notice.

             As I mentioned, two senior Shell executives Dave Lawrence and Marvin Odum are going to be visiting Alaska Wednesday
            through Friday this week and I would like them to meet with the Governor. Mr. Lawrence is Executive Vice President of
            Exploration and based in the Hague , while Mr. Odum is Shell's Executive Vice President for the Americas in Houston.
            Attached below is their bios.

            They are available to meet after 3:00 PM Wednesday or from 8 AM till 2 PM on Thursday. On Friday, they will be visiting
            Barrow.

            Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I can be reached at 646-7108 or my cell 301-3966.

            Cam

            For the most part Arctic Power funding from the state will stop. We left 120,000 to continue their website and
            ability to send out information. They really were not being useful even though they continued to submit monthly
            bills to the state. We needed a more expanded energy plan and effort than just ANWR. I hope Bill's story turned
            out OK.

             Kris,

             Thanks for your offer to assist with a Shell request to meet with Gov. Palin. I apologize for the short notice.

             As I mentioned, two senior Shell executives Dave Lawrence and Marvin Odum are going to be visiting Alaska Wednesday
            through Friday this week and I would like them to meet with the Governor. Mr. Lawrence is Executive Vice President of
            Exploration and based in the Hague, while Mr. Odum is Shell's Executive Vice President for the Americas in Houston.
            Attached below is their bios.

            They are available to meet after 3:00 PM Wednesday or from 8 AM till 2 PM on Thursday. On Friday, they will be visiting
            Barrow.

             Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I can be reached at 646-7108 or my cell 301-3966.

             Cam
