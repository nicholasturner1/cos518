             Fyi for Kenai regs messaging ... We came to a good win- win compromise . Just fyi unless DNR
             punts it to you to tell public what we did to protect the river, but allow Mom and Pop
             Alaskan fishermen keep fishing with their old motors for awhile yet, until they have time
             to replace their outboards.

             For background, through the whole process of the Kenai River evaluation I came to my
             personal conclusion that Robert had the best knowledge of the river and the river's best
             interests at heart.   It is great to hear this from him.
