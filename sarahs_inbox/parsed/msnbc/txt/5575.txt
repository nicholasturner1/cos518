              Subject: WTC Funding

            John,

            Information on WTC that I thought you might find helpful:

            Funding for WTC has fluctuated over the years. It has averaged $125k.

            Last year WTC received $450k but that consisted of $150k in operating and $300k in capital . I understand that
            last year was the first time WTC rec'd additional capital funding . The projects under that capital grant have not yet
            been completed. I think a good bit of those funds remain unspent ... but am checking.

            The two capital projects are as follows:

                1)  $150k for light boxes to be deployed in four Asian world trade centers. One has been deployed thus far
                   in Taiwan.
                2) $150k for the Discover Alaska project. This project involves inviting mid-level executives from Asian
                   businesses to visit Alaska on familiarization tours. I believe Greg has been to Asia promoting this idea,
                   but the tours have not yet occurred.
