         Pretty amazing.  Other than the student member, we have had one vacancy in the Board of
         Education.  You selected Pat Shier, who is a huge supporter of homeschooling. I am sure
         Glen is a big fan of Pat's and if I remember correctly he recommended Pat for the
         position.  The real question is whether the board or the legislature is the appropriate
         entity to make changes. Many board members feel that the legislature should clarify the
         law if additional direction is needed to the board. The issue also gets back to the
         homeschool questionnaire that was prepared during the campaign. I am sure Glen had a hand
         in that, knowing that the general questions asked were really intended to pin you down on
         specific proposals that are now being used against you.




         Thanks for the update and sorry for the heartburn.



         Mike

         Fyi. You got clobbered on Fagan's show as he (and Beigel) claim you led me to break "more
         campaign promises" be of bd of educ members and homeschool issue. But dont worry, i got
         the brunt of it. It was ugly.
