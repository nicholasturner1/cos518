              I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the
              works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don't know if
              something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




              Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
              this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
              thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.
