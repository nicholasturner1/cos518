             Watrl, Watr3, and the socalled     Clean Elections initiative have all filed their signatures.
             Elections personnel will begin     verifying signatures across next sixty days. No press
             release will come out from our     office. If anything, the Div of Elections will confirm the
             signatures have been filed and     their verification process kicks into gear.

             Good evening,

             I just heard from Carol and 07WATR, 07WTR3 and 07CASE were properly filed and accepted by
             the division.  The office will start tomorrow with the data entry of the booklets and
             signature verification will most likely start on Wednesday.
