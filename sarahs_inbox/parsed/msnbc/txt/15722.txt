           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor,




           I happened to be watching Glenn Beck last night and saw your appearance. I was completely
           impressed with you and your common-sense approach to the oil crisis and politics in
           general.  I hope that you will make more appearances. It is obvious that you are serving
           the interest of the people, and not in politics to boost your own ego. I truly wish we
           had people in Washington like you; people working for the people. Your constituents in
           Alaska are very fortunate to have you.




           And, congratulations on your new baby. How lucky to have you               for a mom!




           Kim Stealey
