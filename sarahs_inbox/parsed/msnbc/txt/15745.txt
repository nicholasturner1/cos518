          MESSAGE:

          Please consider running for VP. It would be an honor to vote for Gov Palin this November.
          As a woman with conservative values I believe that the Republican party addresses my
          needs.   As a professional woman, I would like to believe that the glass ceiling is
          cracked.   A McCain/Palin ticket is the right choice to show the country we can have change
          and values.
