          Dear Erika,




          Your reply didn't make sense, "you will understand that in our positions our purpose is to
          serve the administrations that we work for and ensure that the main focus of the event
          remains intact."



          Please clarify what the main focus was and how recognizing ALL other past House Managers
          in attendance, and not just a select few, might have derailed that focus. I seriously
          doubt that Governor Palin's Administration would tell you not to recognize me.



          Sharon

          > Dear Sharon,



         > Thank you for taking the time to bring this to my attention. I sincerely apologize that
         you were disappointed at the Former First Ladies Tea, no disrespect was ever intended.
         The event's purpose was to honor the First Ladies' and their contributions to the House
         and State of Alaska. The original intent to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Alaska's
         Statehood was first and foremost the significant contributions that the First Ladies have
         made.



         > It would have been wonderful to have included everyone, but I'm confident that having
         had this role, you will understand that in our positions our purpose is to serve the
         administrations that we work for and ensure that the main focus of the event remains
         intact.  I do appreciate that you took the time to address this and give me the
         opportunity to respond.
