              Governor,

              I have included your event info, remarks , and an updated , detailed schedule of the base tour for Friday. A few
              things to be aware of.

              -Susan Hemadez , the FWA widow who initiated the legislation , will be present with her family.
              -Sen. Wilkens will be present to introduce you and start the event, and will also close the event FWA is in his
              Senate district.

              Regarding the base tour.

              -You are invited and encouraged to try out the simulations, so long as you are comfortable . They'd love it if you
              tried out at least one of the three (they can create a calm , battle-free scenario that won 't be physically or
              emotionally jarring), but you are welcome , of course, to observe only, if you so choose . They planned the day out
              as though you'd have your entire family with you ; their one concern was that you might have to climb a lot of steps
              while holding Trig; I let them know you'd be fine0

              Explanation of simulation acronyms in the order in which you will tour them (also included in packet info):

              *BCTC - Battle Command Training Center. This is where you will spend the majority of your tour, and also where
              you will meet FWA soldiers.

              **HEAT - Mock-up simulation of a Military equipped HUM-V ; terrain and situation can be simulated to exact
              specifications , and is largely used to train soldiers how to exit vehicle if it turns upside down.

              ***Stryker Simulation - training aid for operating and driving Stryker vehicle.

              ****EST (I believe stands for "Engagement Simulated Training") - room the size of a small movie theatre, with a
              massive screen that plays simulated situations to train soldiers for battle . Sort of a glorified video game; the room
              is equipped with sandbags , weapons, and the simulations will play out battle scenes where the soldiers "shoot the
              bad guys."

              I believe that Shelley and Patricia are attending Kris' father's funeral; I will send the briefing booklets for Friday's
              two sets of signings out with them to give you before you leave . Please let me know if you have any questions. I
              hope you have a wonderful trip, and thanks so muchl
