              Yes, but I'm cleaning it up some after getting comments from Marty and

              Talis.

              However, I raised the points in two speeches last night in Fbx

              (Republican Lunch and Lincoln Dinner)[see Fbx News Miner article--they

              only got part of it, but it's a start.



              I also wanted to raise an idea with you since I found out you were

              involved as Mayor in making Wasilla a City of Character. What if you

              took it a step farther and made Alaska a State of Character. You could

              appoint a "Character Council" of private sector people to lead the

              charge and in state government we could begin to focus on character

              traits--I've got more on this but since you've already done it on a

              city level I think it's the next step for you/us beyond the ethics

              debate.



              I told Kris Perry that I was working on bringing you a proposal (Jay

              Pullins is helping me in my office.



              Enjoy DC!
