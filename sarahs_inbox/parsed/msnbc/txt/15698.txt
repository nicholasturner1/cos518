           Yes, unless there are a few more things we can do in Anchorage office- I may need to touch
           base with a few staffers on some things... and some stuff is heating up with leggies'
           races (deadline for filing today) that I may be asked to comment on (and I'm happy to do
           so), including the GOP trying to enforce and old GOP bylaw - newly discovered - that
           prohibits anyone from running as an R if they haven't been registered for at least six
           months (linda menard switched from non-partisan to R more recently than six months... as
           have so many other past R candidates like Ralph Samuels was allowed to do)... it would be
           unprecendented to have that old bylaw enforced but I hear this is what lyda's son-in-law
           Tuckerman (former GOP chair) has up his sleeve to keep linda from running. Anyway- if
           asked to comment on it I will. (Remember the LAW that was changed for lyda, allowing her
           to run even though she's missed a deadline to file?! we have that legislation and the
           press reports on that issue.) I'll comment because this issue is big- it's about taking
           away an American's right to run for office (I don't care what party is involved in this).
