           Hello Leo:

           Whenever the KABATA folks want to give me a briefing on their progress, pls let me know
           and we'll sit and hear them out. Frank Bailey is taking names for board replacements to
           deal with Wuerch's resignation- he'll stay in touch with you as we get closer to naming
           someone to fill that slot.

              Also, keep your fingers crossed on AGIA passage and the accompanying appropriations
           bill. Big budget for DOT and infrastructure improvements coming your way with affirmative
           vote. Say your prayers.
