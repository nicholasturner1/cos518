             I will look at. the office this am. Tnings are okay - a lot of damage to the truck. He
             slid off the embankment (hill) at homedepot and went over the edge to Costco.



             Did Todd land from Sitka today? The only two things on schedule is bureau chief and call
             in to Mark KFQD show 10 and 10:30.

             J- are there any family invites for MLK day events in Anchorage? Kids don't have school
             that day- they could travel.



             How's the recovery after the wreck last night? I hope he's ok!
