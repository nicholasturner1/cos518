              Governor,



              Due to the weather and current road conditions, the police are requesting that the public
              stay off the roads and especially not come into the downtown area until conditions
              improve.  The federal government and city government offices will be closed today. We are
              releasing a statement that all non-essential employees should stay home. Annette will go
              on the radio and make the same annoucement.



              The office will be pretty quiet today.   The weather will not slow my truck down much so I
              will be in as usual. Let me know if you will be going to the office as well. I have a
              number of items to go over with you. Thanks.



              Mike
