             E- don't know if you got my note by kitchen tv last wk , but I ' m still wondering about sun
             bed and upstairs washer . Is there an outlet yet? Or should everything just get placed
             downstairs in basement where an outlet already is in place? I'd like to do something with
             both appliances soon so they can be utilized . Thanks
