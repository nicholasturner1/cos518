          Governor - We have been asked to do a PSA Taping for the Alaska Food Bank. We have the
          script ready and the video guys had a great idea of setting something up to tape at the
          house - i.e. It would be a great visual to have you carry in a paper bag as you read the
          script - kind of like you are coming home with the groceries. It would be a great visual
          for the TV version.




          I know we have two events at the house tomorrow - so this could be set up for Thursday or
          Friday around the lunch hour. Thanks, Janice
