              Governor:




             Tara Jollie came to Juneau yesterday (Friday) after we'd been gathering information for
             awhile.



             We are finalizing your AFN speech.



             We are working on it through the weekend and will have a hard copy final draft for you on
             Monday.




             Tara wanted you to know that she will be at AFN.




             Beth Leschper
