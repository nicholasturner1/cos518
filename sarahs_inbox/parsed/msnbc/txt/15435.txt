         Janice,

         Joe Balash and I thought it a good idea for the Governor to talk personally to the two
         Premiers in order to tell them that her two Commissioners (of DNR & Revenue) had
         determined that TransCanada Alaska's project (as presented in their AGIA' application)
         maximized Alaska's interests and would move the Alaska Gasline project forward. And,
         furthermore, the Governor and the Commissioners would be forwarding to Alaska's
         Legislature a recommendation to approve the recommendation that an AGIA License be issued
         to TransCanada.



         I hope this is helpful.

         Marty

         Sorry, I did not scroll down far enough to see the question. I have an idea about how the
         discussion should go, but would not want to steer anybody wrong. Marty, who is copied,
         should answer this question, as it was Marty who determined that the Governor should make
         these two Premier calls. Sorry I am not of any assistance.

          Yes, this is all set up. She will be making calls to both Premiers Fentie and Campbell in.
          the morning . I am fairly certain that Kris and Janice are aware of these two calls, but
          am copying them in case.

         I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
         they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



         Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
         ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
         mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
         one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
         Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
