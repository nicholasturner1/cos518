               Joe,

               FYI, I just advised Beth that all press contacts on the Pt Thomson' litigation should go
               to Nan Thompson.  This is for several reasons;

              1.  Nan is the DNR' person most up to speed on the technical, legal issues on the Pt
              Thomson' litigation;

              2.  This Superior Court decision WILL be appealed to the Supreme Court and therefore we
              must continue to be careful with what is said about the case;

              3.  The Superior Crt decision is a BIG win for the State, but, there is a "remand" to DNR
              embeded in the decision, and we need to be aware of that with whatever is said.
              Furthermore, we haven't sorted out what this remand requires and what the implication of
              the remand might be.

              Thanks,

              Marty
