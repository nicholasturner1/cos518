                Thank you and I will speak to Sen. McCain. I understand why supporters may not want to "detract"...
                but many Americans sure want to see some kind progress with ANWR. Perhaps the supports are right
                on the tactic though- they've been fighting the battle longer than I have. Thanks

               I have followed up with the White = House on your letter to President Bush supporting the request of ten
               = Senators to allow seismic work in the coastal plain of ANWR. While = no final decisions have been
               made, it doesn't look good.

               The Bush Administration is concerned about = compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act,
               the compatibility = test under the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act, lack of = funding,
               questions about who would do the work, etc. All of this = translates into a question of timing. At this
               point, I don't think = that the Administration wants to take on such a controversial issue with = so few
               months remaining in office, all of the rhetoric not withstanding.&nb= sp;

               I tried to respond on each point , emphasizing = the non-intrusive nature of seismic work , thereby
               mitigating issues = involving NEPA and the compatibility test. However, I don't think I = made much
               progress.

               One other interesting point from a Congressional= staffer. He felt that a focus on seismic activity might
               actually = detract from the effort to open the coastal plain to responsible = development. Many
               Republicans in Congress want to keep the emphasis = on the main issue with no distractions.

               The tide of public opinion is clearly beginning = to turn in our favor. However, I'm not at all sure that
               this will = manifest itself in the Congressional energy debate that will resume = in the fall. Looking to
               the future, I hope that you will have a = chance to talk with Senator McCain or his people during the
               Republican = convention.
