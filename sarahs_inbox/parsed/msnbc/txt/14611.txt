             Thank the Lord he said he's happy to step up as Acting COS. He agreed we need to find
             someone permanent who'll be in the Anchorage office most of the time - that it's tough on
             some working far apart. We had a very good talk- he's professional, supportive, nose-to-
             the-grindstone good guy.
