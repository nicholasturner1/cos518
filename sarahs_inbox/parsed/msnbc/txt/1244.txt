MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your new baby!! I have 2 daughters, the youngest who has Down
syndrome. She is 11 years old now and is the light of my life! Everyone who meets her and gets a
chance to talk with her feels they have been blessed.

She is reading, making change, adding, fixing her own breakfasts, makes her bed, feeds her cat...in
other words, have expectations for your child!!

For now, the most important thing to do is to celebrate the birth of your baby! These are days you will
never get back.

If there is anyway that I can be of help.. .answer questions, refer you to help, etc., please feel free to
contact me!

Sincerely,

Sue Brown
