            This is the first I've seen of the presser, but Larry's edits are excellent - is there a need to tweak
            anything else in this?

              Governor,

              I have attached DOTs draft press release that has now been edited by Larry Persily. It appears
              to me to be for Alaska media. Randy just returned from DOT and I told him I want to finalize the
              plan for Gravina today including press advisory, confirmed date and message for national
              audience, communication to local legislators and press release.

              Mike

              Russ and Randy,

             Yes, DOT sent us the draft to look over. My rewritten version is attached. And
             here are the accompanying comments I sent DOT at the same time:

             John & Larry,
             Attached is draft that DOT is kicking around. I'm suspecting/hoping that it has been run through your
             office by now.
             I've CC'd Randy so he can run point for the gov's office on this issue. I know he planned to call you and
             MacKinnon regarding this issue soon.
             A quick background would best be saved for a phone conversation. Suffice to say, I'm not comfortable
             with DOT generating drafts and I never asked for them to provide one. They are being "helpful."
             Russ
