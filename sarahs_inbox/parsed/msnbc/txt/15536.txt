               Steve,

               This morning our office sent you a fax from Mayor Begich 's office (rec'd at 5:30 pm Friday) on energy priorities.
               Please see his media advisory for press conference tomorrow. Were you able to follow -up with his office? We want
               to make sure we're ahead on this.

               Also, Governor - I did speak with David Ramseur this afternoon and told him about the timing of the fax.

               Kris
