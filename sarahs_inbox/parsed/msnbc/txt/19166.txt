         Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time (it's overdue) to move on.



        What process are you, as COS, using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
        hands (I s oke with Emil about Prvileg yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
        Leo about Privile ed... I'll cc t Hem in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
        the notifications , should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



        I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
        ended . If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
        overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Material
        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


        Thanks
