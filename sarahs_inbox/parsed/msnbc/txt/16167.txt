            Subject:                 Kenai Bill Signing - Tomorrow, Wed., 06.18.08


            Governor - I received a call from Keith Hamilton, President of the Christian College in
            Kenai (approx. 5 min.) from Kenai Landings. He would like the Governor to visit the
            campus briefly.  I stated to Mr. Hamilton that your schedule is booked during the Bill
            Signing and asked if he was going to attend. He said he was going to try to attend as he
            also attends Chamber events.




            I just wanted you aware in case he approaches with this request. I did let Frank know
            earlier too.  I have discouraged this in terms of timing. Janice
