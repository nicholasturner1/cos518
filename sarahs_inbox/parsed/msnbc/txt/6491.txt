       I'm sure the Empire is picking up on this because of the Budget Report. The story was
       basically the Budget Report transcribing the audio tape from the meeting. There are
       numerous asides referencing the rambling nature of Mr. Brady's comments. In the
       transcript, Brady says he advised the Governor that he intended to make the proposal and
       said that he did not allow her to comment, that he did not ask for her input, and that the
       only thing the Governor said was, "You have a lot of guts."(A nice self-serving reporting
       of the "conversation.")




       As background, Greg Erickson has submitted his name for consideration for the open PFC
       seat.  He has no love lost for Mr. Brady.

       I am going to say that you have NOT looked into the proposal.

       It was the weirdest conversation. He was rambling - I didnt get a word in edgewise - and
       he told me he was going to tell his board that he wanted to see the office move to
       Anchorage so they could hire more qualified people. Empire should interview him, not me.

       Governor-



      Here's a weird one. Do you recall speaking with Carl Brady with the Alaska Permanent Fund
      Corporation back in March regarding moving the corporate offices from Juneau to Anchorage?



      Carl Brady told the board that he talked to you about it (in March) and the Juneau Empire
      is following up. Why now - I have no idea!
