                An employee of Dept. of Labor, Voc Rehab, apparently had a sexual encounter with a client , and the
                dient has said she Is "going to the press" with the information . See below for the account provided
                to me. I have not confirmed that the employee was put on leave without pay.

                You may have received this information already from DOL, so I apologize for any duplication.

                Hi Nicki,

                I'm not sure how I missed your call today as I had my phone with me at that time. I was calling you just to let you
                know that Russ Cussak called me at home this morning to let me know that a voc rehab counselor from Fbx
                called him this morning to let him know that he had been intimate with a client and that she was planning
                on going to the press . I advised him to put the employee on leave without pay during the Investigation.
                Just a heads up it case it hits the news! I'll talk to you later.
