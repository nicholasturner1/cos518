Subject: Scholastic Book Distribution, Look 2 a Book Tea,

and Harvard Questionnaire




Hi Todd-

  have Scholastic, books that need to be distributed to elementary schools. We gave a few to the
elementary schools in Juneau for the Look 2 a Book Tea. I contacted the Dept. of Education and
asked for a list of the 6-8 schools in Alaska that really needed books. They are in the Lower
Kuskokwin School District and the rest the information is listed below. Is it okay if I send the books to
these schools on your behalf? Let me know if you have any other thoughts on this or other schools
that you'd like to give books to.

Jennifer Scott of the Look 2 a Book group was requesting a tea on Tuesday, May 6, 2008 or
sometime close to that. Are you interested in hosting a tea at the House? It would be about the
same as last year. If it's something that you'd consider, we could coordinate it with a Foundation
Luncheon or it could serve as a purpose for a TA. If we use it as a purpose then we could tell them
yes, and then you could wait until early 2008 to set a date... IF you don't want to host this event or at

                                                         1                                   ROSTON 01195

the last minute are not able to attend, we could ask the Commissioner of Education to host/attend on
your behalf.

I received another packet for the Harvard questionnaire, she's enclosed a follow up letter, and sent
another survey. I'll send you the packet with the Governor's mail.

Thanks!

Erika
