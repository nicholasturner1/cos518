Good Afternoon Governor Palin,



First and foremost Congratulations on your new blessing. I know your joy of motherhood being a
mother of six children myself. Which leads me to my comment.



I truly hope that something is being looked at this year regarding the child care Crisis this community
is in. I am as well a foster mother and had to look for a state licensed daycare provider for my many
children that come to live with me and my family and it was never easy. Now it is impossible to find
any licensed daycare and with St. Vincent DePaul deciding on whether they will continue to do
daycare in the future makes me very worried.



If you would like to discuss this matter with me futher you can reach me at 723-0641.



Thank you for your service to this Great State of Alaska.



Louise Kadinger

Concerned Mother of 6
