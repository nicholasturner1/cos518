             Subject:                 Marty's deal

             Marty- I just read Bradner's column on the LNG deal. It's encouraging to read that he
             "gets it"... that the deal you put together is outstanding, and I'd hope his confidence in
             that deal translates into a more positive light from him shed on AGIA's abilities.



             Thank you again for the outstanding moves you made with the LNG exports.
