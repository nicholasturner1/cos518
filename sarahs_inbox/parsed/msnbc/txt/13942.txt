             Sat next to Nelson Cohen (US Attorney) on the way down to Juneau. He's got money and I
             think one person to open a Juneau office. Says he's meeting with Talis and others today in
             legal world to tell them about the new office. He's also got a Coast Guard exercise and
             Forest Service activities to attend. He'll be in Jnu til Thurs. Nelson said he'd like to
             pay a courtesy call on you during this trip if you have the time.



             I suggested he see if Talis could have you join their meeting outside the capitol. Talis
             may be calling.
