  Hi Todd,

  When you have a minute, please send this information for your trip to Canada.

  The CEO for the Red Cross is out of town right now , but she'd like to talk to you sometime . Is that
  something you'd be interested in or do you just want a clean break and call it good?

  How' s Willow's basketball team doing?
