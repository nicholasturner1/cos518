             hello,

                  i thank you for your quick response, i have talk to thomas hall who is very familiar with the
             USEERA LAW but he told me that it would take longer to get it done and process.

                     as of now, I am not working and my finacial need is in great attention. I did have a job, with two
             different construction but it seems as if both are in somewhat in contact with my previous employer for
             now i don't have a job on both..i don't have any evidence to prove but it was very suspicious that little at
             a time i was being ignored and not being called to work .... l hope someone can help me so that i can have
             a job and under the USEERA LAW, I hope I will have that justice for what this company did to me just
             because I serve my country in the call of duty... p I e a s e HELP.

                                                 thank u,

                                                  raul
