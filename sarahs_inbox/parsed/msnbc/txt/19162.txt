          Emil gave me a report on his ideas. Kris has it. I'll ask her to provide.

          Moving ahead, Marty and I are excited about Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                  Staffing discussions can follow
          structure and mission iscussions.

          Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
          that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time (it's overdue) to move on.

          What process are you , as COS, using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
          hands ( I spoke with Emil about yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
          Leo about PrivilPnaci ии I'll cc them in this note so they ' re prepared if they have to make
          the notifications ), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



          I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
          ended . If I must inform them myself I will , but I need to know your intention on this
          overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Ma
          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


          Thanks
