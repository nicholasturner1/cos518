                  Either here in the office or at the Gov' s house? Wherever, we're game.

                   The reporter, Bill Yardley, is very excited. I'll try to get a list of other topics, but he's thrilled about
                   the chance to sit down with you and Marty, and learn about the AGIA and gasline in general. I
                   told him that since he's going to be up here and because we'll be launching the AGIA soon, an
                   issue of this kind of national importance would be good to understand and learn from both of you.
                   It would be great to get an article in the NYT.

                   Meghan,
                   Sounds like a great idea . I arrive at 10 am that morning and I have a meeting with the
                   Senate leadership scheduled fron 11:00 - 1: 30 pm & with Chevron at 2:30 - 4:30 pm. Is
                   it possible to do it at 4 : 30 pm? or between the meetings ? If necessary , I can leave the
                   Chevron meeting in Joe Balash's hands and meet with the NYT reporter in that time
                   segment.
                   Marty

                   New York Times' reporter, Bill Yardley, will be in Juneau this week. I'd like to give him the
                   opportunity to sit down with you both and craft a story for the New York Times. Commissioner, I
                   understand you'll be in Juneau on Thursday. Could you both let me know if this is something with
                   which I can move forward? It would provide an incredible opportunity for us. Would probably take
                   an hour of your time , simply because he is not in Alaska all the time to know the details.

                   Thanks,
                   Meghan
