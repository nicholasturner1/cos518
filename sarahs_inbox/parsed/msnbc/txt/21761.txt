             I think if you can make it back here tomorrow , that is the soonest we need you. We may
             need you to get some of the house Dems on board.

             What is your prediction ? Should I hustle on trying to return before my scheduled rtn?

             They were told not to leave or to come back .                I assume they will be flooding back to
             Juneau this afternoon.

                Are all the lawmakers back in Juneau now, anticipating floor action ? Or when do they
               trickle back in?

                The house has the bill on the floor schedule tonight. However , that will be subject to
               the pace of the finance committee work this afternoon . Its possible the committee will
               drag on into the night.



                 In either case , any floor action tonight will be procedural only .             It is most likely
               that any amendments or votes would take place Sunday.

                 I'm hearing the bill may actually get to the floor tonight? Should I try to get back
               there asap?
