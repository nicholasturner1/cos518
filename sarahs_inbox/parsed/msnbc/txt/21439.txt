              A chicken breast would be great- and tell Suzi thanks for the great steak last night

              Would you like to have us send you off with grilled chicken or steak? Macadamia nuts
              seems to be all they give you on that AK Air flt.

              I saw the newspaper clipping that you posted- cute!! :)

             It sounds like I'll be taking the afternoon flt instead of evening flt today- so I'll stop
             by to pick up my bags. Thanks!
