            Rosanne,



            Please incorporate these changes in the last few emails to Randy's statement. We need to
            get this wrapped up and to Meg asap. Not sure what is going on w/email, but I've cc'd
            Bill's personal email.



            Please send us revised draft before it goes to Meg.

            Kris
