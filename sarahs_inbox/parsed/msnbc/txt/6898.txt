             Subject: Gov Schedule 5-5 to 5-8.pdf

           I have attached the Governor's schedule for the next 4 days. The contact number for Kathy Hosford in Skagway
           is 983-3799, that is where Chuck and Sally will be. Fred and Shane have a room reserved in town for the night,
           and they have a 8 passenger van so they can deliver the Governor anywhere she needs to go . Please call me if I
           can help with anything else! I'll be at the Little League event on Saturday because my kids are both on teams this
           year. Karl.
