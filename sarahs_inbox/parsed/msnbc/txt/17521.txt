        I'll surely get this on the schedule, but is the Haines Fair, or another Fair up North?
        May I have the names of the organizers? Thanks!

        Dear Governor Palin,       On Thursday, August 23 from 4:00 pm to 6:30 pm

       there will be the annual fair reception which traditionally was the

        "Governor's Day Reception".            The Alaska State Fair would very much like

       to revive the tradition. In fact, in addition to the formal reception,

                                                                 1

       they would be interested in declaring a "Governor Day".         Is this

       something you can schedule for August 23? Please let me know and I can

       tell them to plan accordingly. Thank-you Talis

                     P.O. Box 110806
                     Juneau, AK 99811-0806

                     Subject: Proposed Regulation Change to Title 12 of the Alaska Administrative Code 12
                              AAC 36 .500-500-550 Requiring Continuing Education for Professional
                              Architects , Engineers and Landscape Architects

                     As a professional engineer, I oppose this proposed regulation.
                          a. It would be improper for anyone not In the profession to administer this regulation
                              as they would not be qualified to render proper judgment regarding the training
                              and whether a licensed professional is not qualified to continue to practice for this
                               reason.
                          b. The Department of Administration is not qualified to administer this regulation
                              and the State should not bear the additional cost of this regulation if no added
                              value or protection is received by the public. No justification has been advanced
                              to legislators or the professionals affected enumerating problems that currently
                              exist, the benefit to the public, and the additional cost incurred to administer this.
                          c. Existing codes and design procedures are continually upgrading and licensed
                              professionals are engaged in this process to continue to practice their profession
                              e.g. National Building Code, State & Municipal Codes , American Association of
                              State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), American Society for Testing
                              & Materials (ASTM), Alaska Test Methods ATM, etc. (I have attached a list of all
                              those used just in the Alaska Standard Specifications for Highway Construction).
                          d. As a Regional Materials Engineer In DOT/PF, I am involved in research and the
                              implementation of it into the current DOT/PF projects . I don't believe that this
                              would qualify as "continuing education" even though we are improving the
                              technology used to build roads that will better resist the wear of studded tires and
                              to design runways that will support aircraft weighing over 1 million pounds.

                     Bottom line is that your agenda and proposed administrative regulations are not In
                     alignment with Governor Palin's commitment to Alaskans.

            "continuing education" for professional engineers.

                     Juneau, AK 99811-0806
                     Subject: Proposed Regulation Change to Title 12 of the Alaska Administrative Code 12
                              AAC 36.500-500-550 Requiring Continuing Education for Professional
                              Architects , Engineers and Landscape Architects

                     As a professional engineer, I oppose this proposed regulation.
                        a. It would be improper for anyone not in the profession to administer this regulation
                             as they would not be qualified to render proper judgment regarding the training
                             and whether a licensed professional is not qualified to continue to practice for this
                              reason.
                         b. The Department of Administration Is not qualified to administer this regulation
                             and the State should not bear the additional cost of this regulation if no added
                             value or protection is received by the public. No Justification has been advanced
                             to legislators or the professionals affected enumerating problems that currently
                             exist, the benefit to the public , and the additional cost Incurred to administer this.
                        c. Existing codes and design procedures are continually upgrading and licensed
                             professionals are engaged In this process to continue to practice their profession
                             e.g. National Building Code , State & Municipal Codes , American Association of
                             State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), American Society for Testing
                             & Materials (ASTM), Alaska Test Methods ATM, etc. (I have attached a list of all
                             those used just in the Alaska Standard Specifications for Highway Construction).
                        d. As a Regional Materials Engineer In DOTIPF, I am involved in research and the
                             implementation of it into the current DOT/PF projects. I don't believe that this
                             would qualify as "continuing education ' even though we are Improving the
                             technology used to build roads that will better resist the wear of studded tires and
                             to design runways that will support aircraft weighing over 1 million pounds.

                     Bottom line is that your agenda and proposed administrative regulations are not in
                     alignment with Governor Palin's commitment to Alaskans.

                     Sincerely,
                       Ew

            Alliance Juneau Update



            4.13.07




            ExxonMobil told House Resources that despite some legislative improvements to House Bill 177 (the Alaska Gasline
            Inducement Act, or "AGIA"), the bill overall still doesn't provide sufficient flexibility for prospective license applicants to
            put forward meaningful proposals. Rather than prescribing specific requirements, the state should lay out general goals in the
            bill and allow applicants flexibility in addressing them.




            Martin Massey, company spokesman, praised changes that tighten criteria for selection of a licensee, allow producers to
            oppose rolled-in tariffs on pipeline expansions and make the $500 million state grant a bid option rather than a requirement.

            Senate Judiciary , meanwhile , focused on issues of judicial review and appeal rights of unsuccessful applicants for the gas
            pipeline license envisioned by AGIA. Appeals could delay final award of a license . The Senate ' s version of AGIA is SB 104.




            Under terms of the current Senate version of the bill , the legislature must pass a resolution approving the administration's
            award of a license.




            Committee members offered differing views . Sen. Bill Wielechowski said consideration of a bill, rather than a resolution,
            would reduce appeal options for an unsuccessful licensee . Sen. Lesil McGuire endorsed use of a resolution . Sen. Gene
            Therriault said the Legislature should set out requirements in the bill and leave licensing to the administration as part of its
            normal executive branch duties.




            At a Judiciary hearing Thursday on SB 104, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance testified that upstream fiscal issues need to
            be resolved before North Slope producers will make commitments for space in a gas pipeline. "The Alaska Gasline
            Inducement Act puts too much emphasis on mitigating the short-term financial risks incurred by pipeline builders and does
            too little to address the much longer-term risks of gas shippers," the Alliance said. "For the sake of Alaska's future, the
            Alliance urges you not only to determine what terms aren't constitutional, but also to find a mutually beneficial solution that
            is.,,
