             no need to change anything with WTC funding... unless we're cutting it back... no increases, no
             justification to move to capital - cowdery can battle for greg on this one if he wants

               John,

               Information on WTC that I thought you might find helpful:

               Funding for WTC has fluctuated over the years . It has averaged $125k.
               Last year WTC received $450k but that consisted of $150k in operating and $ 300k in capital. I
               understand that last year was the first time WTC rec'd additional capital funding . The projects
               under that capital grant have not yet been completed . I think a good bit of those funds remain
               unspent ... but am checking.

               The two capital projects are as follows:

                      1)  $150k for light boxes to be deployed in four Asian world trade centers . One has been
                         deployed thus far in Taiwan.
                      2) $150k for the Discover Alaska project . This project involves inviting mid-level
                         executives from Asian businesses to visit Alaska on familiarization tours. I believe Greg
                         has been to Asia promoting this idea , but the tours have not yet occurred.
