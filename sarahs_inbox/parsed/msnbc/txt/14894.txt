            MESSAGE:

            First of all allow me to say that you are doing a great job for the state of Alaska. I
            know you don't have a lot of free time so I will keep this short. I recently read an
            article about you and your new family addition in our local paper. Our granddaughter also
            has D.S. she will be 10 yrs old this month and she is just a darling to be with. I would
            not have missed knowing her kind soul for anything this world has to offer. She has been
            in several special ed. classes at school and is doing great, she can count to 100 and
            spell her name. She can also speak clearly using sentences . I wish you and your family as
            much joy as we have been blessed with. Again Great Job Performance in your position. Want
            to move to NC? We could use you!
