            MESSAGE:

            You   are an inspiration and a     breath of fresh air after Gov. Murkowski. Congratulations on
            the   baby.  It makes us love      you all the more. Do not back down on the budget. Perhaps
            you   will be able to show the     legislature that not every dime must be spent. Don't let the
            oil   companies bully us, stay     the course.

            Thank you for all you do.
