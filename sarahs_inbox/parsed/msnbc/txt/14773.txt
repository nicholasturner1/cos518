             MESSAGE:

             HI!!




             I was just introduced to you via a news story online about the birth of your 5th child.
             Congratulations to the both of you!!



            I've researched briefly to find out a little more about you (as I'm a republican also and
            the article said you may be up for VP) and I liked what I saw; however, I didn't read
            anywhere if you're a God-fearing person, a born-again believer, or what?



            I will be keeping your family and your new little one in my prayers, and I believe God is
            honored and glorified in your very public decision in accepting him as he is and to defend
            his right to be born. May God truly use him in a powerful way in the lives of others!



            I will be watching for you in future political            news ,   and be sure to remember to take care
            of YOURSELF ok?




            Sincerely,

            Denise in warm , sunny Phoenix

                                                                  1
