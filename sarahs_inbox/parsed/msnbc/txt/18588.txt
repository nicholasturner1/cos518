            I re-wrote in my words ... I'm sure this is still a lot longer than they are expecting , so shorten up as needed.

            there were some things in the speech that were inconsistent with what we've found out the last couple of days of
            edits in the op -ed, so I incorporated those changes. joe and pat need to look at it one time to make sure it's
            factual tho.
