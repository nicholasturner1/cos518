      Yes.

      Things are moving quickly.   Kurt Bruce made a good
      point this morning.  He said most of the retailers
      that handle MM products have known for weeks about the
      coming shutdown and they are already in the midst of
      securing new contracts with others to fill their dairy
      spaces.  He said a press release from you letting
      everyone know that we are on the horizon of a solution
      could stop some of the retailers from signing these
      new contracts.

        I don't think space will be a problem though because
        there will be a lot less product when it becomes 100%
        Alaskan.  Joey will be contacting Kaladi, Cafe del
        Mundo, New Sagaya, various food marts, etc . to keep
        them abreast of the situation.  This is going to be
        exciting.

                 A break from AGIA....Mat Maid, the visit , the truth
                 Posted: June 16, 2007 - 3:01 pm

                 Much has been written about Governor Palin's visit to the Matanuska Maid Dairy and how she was
                 spurned from taking a tour.

                 What you didn't hear about was the actual behind the scenes events which took place.

                 June 13,2007

                 10:00am - The Governor' s Office calls Mat-Maid and requests a tour of the plant . They are told by
                 employees that the plant manager is gone and the only person authorized to give tours , the CEO, is
                 at a well publicized board meeting . It is suggested they reschedule for later.

                 11:00am - Kris Perry from the Governor's Office calls and announces that Governor Patin will be
                 there at noon . Perry is told once again that there will be noone there authorized to give a tour. Mat-
                 Maid is told it is will just be a few people.

                 11:30am - Unable to reach the CEO on his cell phone because he is in the middle of a presentation
                 to the creamery board , the CEO's wife fields a frantic phone call from the office.

                 11:45am - The CEO's wife in her car arrives at the Westmark Hotel where she slips a note to the
                 CEO. The public session has just begun and the CEO is unable to leave until he is finished with Q
                 &A. He instructs his office to make the governor as comfortable as possible in the conference room
                 until he can break away.

                 Noon - The Governor arrives with a large entourage of people, including her husband Todd, daughter
                 Piper, DNR officials, staff and security. Also in tow is several media outlets.

                 Todd Patin becomes agitated and asks the Mat-Maid employees "are you telling me you won't let the
                 Governor of Alaska tour this facility?"

                 12:30pm - The CEO finally breaks away from the meeting and calls his office to inform them he is 7
                 or 8 minutes away from the plant.

                 Back at Mat-Maid , the Governor decides to wait no longer and leaves before the CEO arives.

                 Prediction - Next week a new creamery board will be appointed and the head will be Robert Gottstein
                 who has also been recently awarded a grant for $475 ,000 from the federal government to open a milk
                 bottling plant in Palmer.

                 Fact - Did you know that over the last 20 years, Matanuska Maid in an effort to support Alaskan
                 Grown have paid Alaskan Dairy Farmers roughly $4 million dollars more for locally produced milk
                 than they paid for milk imported from outside Alaska?

                 Much more on this story to come.
