         Dear Governor,




         I am the Mother of a 16 year old son with Down Syndrome. Get ready for the ride of your
         life!! Yes, they are a lot of work, but they are a lot of joy. There is never a dull
         moment in our house. My Son, Tyler, loves music of any kind. If you will go to youtube and
         on the search, type in Mylo & Tylo and Mylo and Tylo 2008. Tyler is singing Long Black
         Train with the Smith Brothers, a local Gospel group. They are singing both times to raise
         money for the Exceptional Center, a learning center for mentally and physically
         challenged adults.




         God Bless you and your family on your wonderful and sometimes frustrating journey. I
         promise you wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.




         Sincerely,




                                                              1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0022233
