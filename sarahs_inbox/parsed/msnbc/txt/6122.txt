         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor Palin,



         I disagree with your budget veto of the Fire           Island wind project. This project is an
         important, visible commitment to alternative           energy sources. It also begins to address
         concerns we all have about global warming. I           was very sad to hear you vetoed it. I hope
         your opinion changes and you can support this          project in the future.



         Sincerely,

         Alan Smith
