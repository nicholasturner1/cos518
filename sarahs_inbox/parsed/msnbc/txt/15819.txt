           Dear Governor Palin:




           I was born and raised in New York City, and relocated to the Dallas, Texas area 26 years
           ago. Bad decision! It's brutally hot down here! I have no lost love for the Big Apple
           either! I would love to move to Montana, but my children won't go with me. So, I'm stuck
           here in sweltering Texas!




           I had the pleasure of seeing you on the Glenn Beck show and you are one terrific woman! I
           have been a lifelong Conservative Independent, and you are incredibly refreshing. I hope
           that Senator McCain has the good sense to choose you as his running mate. Not only would
           you bring intelligence and sanity to the White House, but your presence will beautify the
           scenery!




                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 _0018884

           Would you be kind enough to send me an autographed picture? It would be greatly.
           appreciated.




           God bless you and your family.




           Respectfully,




           John M. Trautman
