              No, I haven't and I haven't seen anything in obits. I'll see what I can find out and will
              let you know.



              George ' s service was nice . One of the pictures they had on display was of you & George at
              the swearing in. A great picture , beaming smiles . His daughter talked about me so I felt
              compelled to speak . Tough . The first time I met him was at a fundraiser for you at the
              Regan bldg . He was the first to arrive and one of the last to leave . I gave them a letter
              from you, plus sent flowers.

              Dear Sarah.

                             I thought you would want to know, since you've had a good working

              relationship for many years (and he adores you) with burt, that his

              wife passed away yesterday Oct 24.

                            He is taking her death very hard .    Celia is being cremated.       There

             will be a Memorial Service at St Davids , but date is not yet

             established.

                            Take care, keep up the good work - we all root for you!           Merlyn

             Matheson
