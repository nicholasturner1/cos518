          Goodmorning,



         That's strange-I just received this email dated Sep 7, (8:54AM), but it was delayed an
         entire day...  Hopefully that wasn't the case w any of your other emails yesterday.



         Thanks so much for the invitation to your home for dinner. We were really looking forward
         to watching Bristol's game and seeing you guys! By the time we got in and got a rental
         car it was already about 8 o'clock. AK Air and mechanicals-ugh!




         Kaitlin was sad/disappointed, she was especially looking forward to seeing Piper and
         Willow.



         The fball team usually stays at the HS gyms, but they found a really cheap hotel in Palmer
         ( Moose something ..?) so they splurged.



         Hopefully we'll see the girls (maybe you too) at the game today!

        I'll be in the Anchorage office today so hollar if anything changes re: coming out to
        wasilla this evening - is the team staying in a wasilla hotel, or anchorage?



        It would be fun to go to Bristol's game tonight so we 'll do dinner very casual and then go
        up to the field.
