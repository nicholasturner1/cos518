          Geez - that is demanding . Thanks for doing what you can on it, though it sounds like an
          impossible task at this point. Hopefully they'll take it out on Lyda, not us , if they're
          trying to make a point re: expensive litigation that resulted in no law changes.

          Dear Governor Palin,

                Apparently Rep. Gara and Sen. French are demanding that my dept. give the total of
          dollars spent in the last thirty years on abortion litigation by the state by noon
          tomorrow.  We may or may not have an answer as it is not clear we have a method of
          compiling that material that far back especially on such short notice. I do not know the
          urgency other than they must anticipate it will become the topic of a special session
          after all.  This is just a heads up in case you know more or even if you have not heard
          about it.  Talis
