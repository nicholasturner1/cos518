             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                        Governor Applauds the State Senate for Passage of Senate Bill 82


            March 14, 2007, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today applauded the Alaska State
            Senate for unanimously passing the Governor's special appropriations bill to fund oil and gas
            development initiatives. The measure, SB82, passed by a vote of 19 to 0.

            "Passage of this bill makes a statement that the Alaska State Senate and I are working
            together to develop Alaska 's oil and natural gas resources," said Governor Palin. "I want to
            recognize Senate Finance Co-Chair Lyman Hoffman for leading the effort to put this bill
            forward, and I want to thank all Senators for their help and support."

            SB82 is the first appropriation bill to come to the Senate Floor this session. The fact that it
            provides funding for the Governor's oil and natural gas development initiatives reflects the
            priority of the Administration and the Legislature to develop Alaska's natural gas and bring it
            to market.

            The bill totals $34.5 million in general funds , with $33 . 1 million for oil and gas activities in
            the Departments of Law, Revenue , Natural Resources and Administration (AOGCC). The
            remainder is a separate , special appropriation for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.

            The bill will now move over to the House of Representatives for consideration.

            Please look at this and approve as quickly as possible. Essentially, I took John's information
            and Karen's and combined to form a press release in order to quickly turn this.

            Thanks!
