           Governor:




           Please let Senator McCain know of your interest in the GOP vice presidential nomination!
           Your record of achievement and charisma will give his ticket the spark and jump start it
           DESPERATELY needs!




           You and the Senator are the last line of defense to prevent the ultra-left wing Senator
           Obama from reaching the White House and destroying America!
