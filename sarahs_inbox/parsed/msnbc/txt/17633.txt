         Got it, thanks. I'm so un-enthused about that mtg.



        An office in Vietnam??? Can't wait to hear their rationale for that.

        Subject: Meeting



        Governor,




        I understand that tomorrow you'll be meeting with Senator Cowdery and Greg Wolf from World
        Trade Center.  I wanted to give you a heads up that I met w/Cowdery while I was in Juneau.
          During that meeting he told me that they planned to increase the amount, from the
        $650,000 initially requested in the proposal, to $700,000 and that they plan to open a
        State of Alaska trade office in Vietnam (although not included in WTC's proposal).




        Another subject that Greg will likely bring up is the Export Alaska luncheon on May 29th.
        You've been invited to participate and present the Governor ' s Exporter of the Year Award.
        Below is what I pasted from their website .  FYI, our International Trade Office works with
        businesses to encourage nominations , collects nominations etc.




        I had good discussions w/Mike Tibbles & John Bitney while I was in Juneau and they know
        what my thoughts on the subject of WTC, and the proposal, are. I also understand that
                                                                1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0001277
