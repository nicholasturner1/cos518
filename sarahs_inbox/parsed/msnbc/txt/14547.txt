           Even if they're not ready I sign them anyway in a ceremonial signing.

          He said it wasn 't his area, or something to that effect.

          BUT, there IS good news from Russ. The bills we are waiting on for this

          week's bill signing events may be on their way to us. Lyda is in Texas

          and apparently she has signed them (SB 209, 243, 101 dealing with older

          Americans and I think some others, too -- think Purple Heart Trail bill

          which we need by Saturday). Lyda is sending them. They MAY be here by

          Thursday's bill signing - but might not make it. We'll keep tracking it.

          But the Saturday bill will probably be here in time.

           I just called Russ and he said to ask Karen your question below -- that

           she handles that. I will follow up with Karen.



          NOTE: FYI, he told me that all of them -          Russ , Karen , Mike T. -- were

          perplexed with your questioning of them late Friday night via email. He

           said there are things we have no control over -- like when we get the

          budget. They can give it to us at the same time as the special session

          and we can't do anything about it.

          First we have to make sure COS and Russ asked , gave definitive timeline,

          was refused by which lawmakers ,       etc. We need backup paper trail for all

          that be we know lyda and harris will claim we didn't "communicate" any

          of this to them.
