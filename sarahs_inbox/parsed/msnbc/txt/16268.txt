            It is Seaton's bill. I can't imagine they would want to spend their time with you talking
            about landowners allowing the use of their land without charge for a recreational
            activity.   I will clarify.



            Channel 11 just called. Would you like to talk about the ANWR letter sent to Congress?

           Governor-




           If the announcement comes out on Wednesday, could we schedule a 5 o'clock live shot with
           Channel 11? This could be live in studio or via phone.



           Also, the Homer radio station would a few minutes of your time on Thursday to talk about
           House Bill 25. The station is only a few minutes from the bill signing event. Please let
           me know if you would like me to pursue this.
