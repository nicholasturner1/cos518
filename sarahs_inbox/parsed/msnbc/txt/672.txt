Kris,



I heard a little of what went on today regarding dad

and my involvement in whatever.It reminds me when Tib

told Emil not to hire Jerry Ward because Todd had

concerns etc..1 guess I'm easy to blame it on even

though theirs others that want the same change



Please remind everybody that dad was offered to serve

on an advisory committee,but he's not going to accept.

For Miller to accuse my dad or me for any wrong doing

is unbelievable and another reason for a needed change

in AIDEA.
