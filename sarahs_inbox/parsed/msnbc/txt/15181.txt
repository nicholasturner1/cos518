          The complaints I've heard about Ross' report was that he suggested we're jumping/reacting
          thanks to Harris' demand for attention to be given to energy relief.

          We listened to the segment and found it was defensible because he referenced the email
          about a second special session. So technically there's nothing we can correct. But Sharon
          will reiterate that energy planning has been going on since you hired Steve in March.

           Did the reporter get corrected?

            I think the best way to handle this is to reiterate that point at Thursday ' s press
           conference.

            I missed it, but sounds like this is another one that needs to be corrected asap so this
           reporter gets educated . Then the messaging from here on out has to be clear that we've
           been working on this since Steve was hired many ' weeks ago.

             We'll get a transcript asap. Harris had some pretty tough words tonight.

             What?? We're not calling the energy sp session b/c of harris' letter!! Mike Ross has it
           wrong. We were talking about this weeks ago-back when we were discussing suspending the
           gad tax. Gov Palin had foresight on this one-i have the emails to prove it.
