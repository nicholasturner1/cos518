               Relayed all that we'd gone over yesterday. Let him do most of the talking. I do like him-
               much more so than Bowles, Suttles, Massey... the rest of 'em.



               Good convo, but he certainly wants us to work with them on gasline. He said- very
               confidentially- he's able by next week to "bring along another producer". He mentioned
               TransCanada numerous times in the convo... I said I recognized and could appreciate cp's
               relationship with tc and wondered if they still anticipate hooking up to work together on
               gasline. He said that is what he anticipates.



              Told him we're committed to AGIA, won't dismiss their plan out-of-hand, but with no known
              fiscal term requirements (he says it's still 20-25 yrs with no oil tax lockup request), no
              upstream requirements made known to us, and no committment of cp's own gas for this
              project (he insists it's in their offer/plan, but will double check with his guys on
              that), that their offer just doesn't seem to be in our best interest... I reminded him
              we're still evaluating the law-abiding applications.



              I tried not to take too much delight in reminding him how much we desire to work with them
              on all oil/gas developments, but some of his peeps weren't helping the cause at all on
              that front as they continue to, essentially, bad mouth our administration's actions and
              intentions (was mostly thinking of Rick Solie and a few others). I told him he needed to
              know that. He says that's unacceptable that there's anything going on like that and they
              should have only one message - that they're glad to work with us.



              He wanted to make sure I remembered cp broke away from the boys on this - I said I was
              very glad to see that, and cp proves it's the Big Dog by taking such action.



              Must be BP he's referring to when confiding he'd bring along another producer? I didn't
              ask.
