            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your son .......

            My eldest nephew Michael was born with Down syndrome. He will turn 20 this month, is a
            high school graduate and is currently working at a training facility for special needs
            individuals in Pennsylvania.

            Michael is an avid Florida fan, thanks to "Mother". Don't ask me why he calls my mom that,
            it's just something he came up with some years ago. He also has an uncanny sense of
            humor.  I tell most people to whom I speak of him that they would have to meet him to
            understand what I'm talking about.

            Michael has a younger brother, Joe. Talk about two opposites! Michael being the sports
            fan / animal lover / movie buff... But as much as they torment each other, don't Dare pick
            on the other's brother ........ they will defend each other to the bitter end!

            Treat Trig as normally as possible. Socialization is paramount. (Michael has yet to meet a
            stranger.) Enjoy his love and his hugs, his kisses and his laughter.

            We couldn' t imagine life without Michael , even if he Is 14 hours away!
