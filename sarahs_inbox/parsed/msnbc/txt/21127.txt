         MESSAGE:

         We are traveling, and we saw in the ADN that your son has joined the Army. May God
         protect him.rnrnJust in case your military affairs guy has not informed you there is an
         Alaskan National Guard unit of approximately 47 men and women who will be deployed to Iraq
         this month.  They are currently completing their training in Alaska at Ft.
         Rich.rnrnAccording to my so-in-law their duty assignement, convoy protection and checks
         points, will be in one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq. He did not have to return so
         soon, but he felt an obligation to the green troops he has helped to train to be there to
         help reduce casualties.  He believes the unit will suffer killed and wounded.rnrnYou had
         nothing to do with the war or the decisions to send an Alaskan unit, but it would be nice
         for the members if you were there to see them off. rnrnMy prayer is that despite my son-
         in-law's worst expectations, you will not have to meet grieving spouses and/or children
         and/or parents but be there to greet

         all of the unit when they return.
