           Honorable Lt. Gov. Parnell,

           I read with great interest the Anchorage Daily News which reports you

           will challenge Don Young. Congratulations.

           Lt. Gov. I still await a response to my email dated nearly three weeks

           ago.    I await response on your commitment to the safety of Alaska Citizens.

           Your response is of even more importance to me now that I will be faced

           with voting or not voting for you yet again as a representative of

           Alaska at the national level.

           I question what the Palin Parnell leadership has done for the individual

           citizen of Alaska and what you can offer us at the national level. Cost

           of living continues to sky rocket while Comm. Kreitzer is quoted in the

           paper saying that a "4-3-3 is a significant increase " for the

           supervisors union.        Frankly it is a joke and insult.            I'm ashamed they

           ratified the contract.



           Lt. Gov. your commissioner continually fails to negotiate in good faith

           with the Public Safety Employees Association. Your Dept. of Public

           Safety needed wage and benefit increases comparable to the 27% the VPSO

           program is getting yet has returned to the table time and time again

           with a reduction in their original request. The Public Safety Employees

           Association was originally asking for double digit increases in pay and

           benefits.    The Association has now returned to the table with an offer

           of 6.5% this year yet your administration under the guidance of Comm.

           Kreitzer stand fast at 5%, unwilling to budge on 1.5%, after we have

           budged to the tune of double digits.



           Please tell me your safety, that of your families ,             and that of every

          Alaskan are worth 1.5%. Incidentally Gov., Lt.               Gov, and Commissioner


                                                                   1

             Kreitzer 6.5% as requested by PSEA does nothing to make up for the years

             of falling behind state employees endured .       It fails to bring us even

             close to that of our competition for recruitment and retention yet we

             have negotiated ,    compromised , and sacrificed only to find ourselves

             faced with arbitration.



             Time is running out for Alaska Citizens .      Their safety is at stake and

             this administration continues to do nothing.

             I look forward to a response from each of you on this matter,

             Sincerely,
