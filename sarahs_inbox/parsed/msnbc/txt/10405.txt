                Governor:




                DOT believes a high ranking FAA Administrator will be calling within the next 10 days.
               He will either ask for a meeting or want to talk on the phone about a $36 million state
               general fund appropriation for FAA ' s "CAPSTONE " aviation safety program.

                A more detailed description of CAPSTONE and the current status is attached.
