                 Thanks for trying. I know she is busy, especially with the special session now going on. Just for fun, next time
                 you see here show her the attached picture. She is in the lower left hand comer of the picture. Her mom and dad
                 are in the back. This was taken at our house in the 1960's when she lived in Skagway. She has enough
                 business going on, she might enjoy a lighthearted moment in her busy day.
