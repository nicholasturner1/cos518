Todd - Please see attached request. I have spoken to the Governor on this one and she does not
recognize this name. I did not realize the guys going by your house even! If you do not know him -
he needs to begin with Lynne Smith (energy, business). Thanks, Janice

Sarah Palin,



How does one manage to get a meeting with you?



I last spoke with you during your campaign, and I was also the young inventor present with Edward
Peace from UAA that talked with you about alternate energy.



I have written several letters, E-mails, Called numerous times, and even stopped by, but nobody was
home. I keep trying, but to no response.



I would like to get a meeting with you, as would Edward Peace , from UAA.



Any Suggestions?
