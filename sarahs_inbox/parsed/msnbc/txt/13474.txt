           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin and Family,



           I have just read of the birth of your special gift from God and wish you all the joy and
           happiness that this little one will bring to each of you. I also thank God for people like
           you who recognize the value of all human life.



           For 23 years I was a Special Education Teacher here in Massachusetts and know so well the
           loving and lovable nature of children with Down Syndrome. It was my privilege and delight
           to see them grow, learn and bring the gift of their beautiful innocence to all around
           them.



           With respect and love -

           Patricia Stebbins
