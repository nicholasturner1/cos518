             MESSAGE-

             I would like to recommend a book for you to read. Onward Crispy Soldiers. This is the
             remarkable life story written by the sister of a Downes syndrome brother. He lived an
             incredible journey and survived and thrived until the age of 55. I know this family
             personally as fellow church member and they have all touched my life. Mary Perry is a true
             testimony to caring and teached those with special needs. I think this book will touch
             your heart.
