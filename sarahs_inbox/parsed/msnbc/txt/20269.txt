          Fyi, if Click's available for an hour before Nenana would you meet w him and Todd on
          workforce development monies that were cut. (Click is bummed.) Melissa could have the
          Fairbanks Office available for that meeting. (See below)

         For sched pis note Todd and Click and Balash may plan to meet on AGIA training $ before we
         all head to Nenana. Let Melissa know they may use the Fairbanks Office. Britta can also
         meet Melissa at this time and go to the Fairbanks Office to get aquainted there before the
         Nenana trip, then after I need to stop at the Tanana Fair to visit some of those booths
         I've been invited to.
