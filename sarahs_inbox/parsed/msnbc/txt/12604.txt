             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,

             Congratulations on your governorship.I enjoyed reading about your accomplishments on the
             "Governors" website.

             Hope someday you'll consider running for President of the USA.

             I'm sure you've heard the rumors about being selected as Senator McCain's running mate. He
             could use some help.

             Thanks for serving and contributing so much to the welfare of the people in Alaska and to
             others in America.

             The best to you and your family!

             Ron Alford in Raleigh, NC
