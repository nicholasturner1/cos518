         Kris,



         The Governor is looking for the press release. It is attached here with Bruce and Kurt's
         blessings. Please have her review and look at the quotes and tell me if she'd like
         anything changed. I've got Irwin and Galvin going through their quotes as well.



         Thanks!

         Meg
