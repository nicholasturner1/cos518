         On 6/20 you asked Rosanne to send your anwr letter to all presidential candidates. The
         press release announcing you sent the letter went out 6/23 and rosanne should have
         contacted them then. I sent the presser to my contact in the mccain.camp, paulette, and
         holly at boston herald. The email chain is below. Hope this helps : )

         R- when Katz has our anwr letter ready to go (hopefully today!) we need

         to send it to all the Alaskan media outlets, but also other newspapers

         across the US as he wrote such good reasoning in asking Congress when

         will they finally "get it"? Thanks
