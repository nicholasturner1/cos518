           Governor Palin Reaffirms Budget Commitment



           March 21, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - With just over three weeks left in the

           legislative session, Governor Sarah Palin today renewed her commitment

           to work with members of the legislature on responsible operating and

           capital budgets.     In an effort to keep the public informed, Governor

           Palin has answered questions that have been at the center of the budget

           debate.

           How do you feel about the changes proposed by House and Senate to your

           operating budget?

           I am pleased that the House, Senate and Administration all agree that we

          must control the growth of government spending. As we developed our

          budget, we took a hard look at all areas of government spending to

          change the direction of the large increases in previous years. Our

          approach in working with the Legislature has been to welcome additional

          ideas of how the State can be more efficient in serving Alaskans. By

          the end of session, I am confident that we will be able to say the

          Administration and Legislature both contributed to help achieve that
                                                                 1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01 0013800

           common goal of controlling government spending.



           Have you really added more than 1,000 new positions in your budget this

           year?

           When we released our budget to the public and the Legislature on Dec.

           10,   we included a "true up" of existing state positions that had not

           been accounted for in previous administrations. We felt it was

           important to tell Alaskans the real number of state positions and not

           continue the practice of holding a large number of positions off the

           books.    Our "true up" included more than 800 positions that already

           existed but were not reflected in the budget.




           Various sources have suggested that your budget proposes to increase

           spending anywhere from 11 percent to 27 percent. Is this accurate?

           When we released our budget on Dec. 10 we calculated our General Fund

           increase in government spending for operating, capital and supplemental

           budgets at 4 percent. Our budget includes all categories. We included

           items that we knew would require supplemental funding to reflect a more

           accurate comparison between the current year and next year's spending.

           In addition, we clearly reflected the amount of the oil tax credits but

           did not include the funds as agency spending. When determining the

           spending increase from year to year, Alaskans need to look at what is

           included or not included in the number.




          What is your approach on the supplemental budget?

           I have been consistent in that I do not believe the supplemental budget

           is the appropriate vehicle to build a capital budget. It is appropriate

           for operating or capital items to receive early or supplemental funding

          only due to extraordinary or unforeseen circumstances. Projects that do

          not meet this description should be included in a comprehensive capital

          budget.

           The deadline for reviewing the supplemental budget ( SB 256 )            is April 5,

           just 8 days prior to the end of session .          During this time ,    I plan on

           frequent discussions with legislative leaders to work out a plan for

           total savings and an acceptable level of spending .            I have also

           committed to meet with every legislator in an effort to improve

           communication , work in cooperation and learn about items important to

           their individual districts.          A final decision regarding the supplemental

           budget will be made once we have had a chance to meet with legislators

           about their projects.




           What is your intention for the school funding bill?

           I intend to sign the bill .         My goal has always been to provide

           multi-year funding in a level sufficient to provide predictability and

           stability to Alaska school districts.          Certain legislators felt our

           adjustment to the base student allocation          ( BSA) was too high and that

           districts could manage with an increase of $100 BSA .            We have been

           hearing recently from school districts that the amount appropriated to

           date is not sufficient . I also understand that legislators may provide

           some additional funds in FY2009 to help ensure the rising costs of labor

           and energy do not divert money from the classroom.



           Given the revised revenue forecast increasing the amount of surplus

           available ,    have you changed your savings plan?

          We are blessed to have significant budget surplus in the current year

          and projected for next year .         The opportunity to put even more in

          savings than we anticipated in December is something all Alaskans

          support .      That is why it is even more important to work with the

          Legislature on an overall spending plan for operating and capital

          budgets so that we can slow the growth of government , meet the needs of

          Alaskans and save for the future .         Our goal is to save as much as

          possible in FY2008 and FY2009.
