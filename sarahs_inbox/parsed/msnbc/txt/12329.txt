             Subject:                 Kenai and Merit Scholarships

             Spoke to classes at Kenai High, Soldotna High, and Kenai Middle School this morning. All
             three warmly received merit scholarship idea. Interestingly, the 11th graders were most
             active and helped me realize that they really are thinking about what's next after high
             school.



             Got asked questions about gasline, Pebble, our families, etc, nothing unusual.



             Hope all is well and that you enjoy your trip East.
