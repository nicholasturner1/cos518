            Hi,  I am a 45 yr. old single parent of a special needs child who has C.P. He is a twin
            and they were given an overdose of their first D.P.T. shot and Matthew died and Ryan's
            ventricle collapsed which resulted in Hydrocephalyis.   They told me he would probably be a
            vegetable but through God's grace and persistance he walks, talks, and does many things on
            his own.  He is my life and my joy!! My mom has always told me that God will never put on
            me more than I can take and he is always with Ryan and me, helping us, guiding us and
            blessing us.  Ryan

            's dad and I divorced during the pregnancy and he has never been a part of his life. I
            admire you and your husband for facing your son's challenges together. You have touched
            my heart with your story and may God Bless you and your family on your journey with your
            beautiful new addition to your family.   Kimberly Ratliff
