           Governor,



           The AK Women 's Gold Nugget Triathlon is this Sunday , May 18.            I talked

           directly with the contact Betsy Wilson .         She said it's a record setting

           year with 553 first timers - this event is just exploding .             They would

           love to have you shoot the starter gun if you' re available.



           Sunday, May 18

           9:00 a.m.

           Bartlett High School



           Janice
