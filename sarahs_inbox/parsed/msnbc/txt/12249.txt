             address : POBox 872306 Wasilla AK 99867




             MESSAGE:

             Gov Palin:  On Feb 11th I sent your office a message requesting a birthday card from you
             to my grand son Parker Hovila in Wasilla; since you both have the same birthday.



             Thanks very much for sending the card to him.   To say he was excited is an
             understatement.  He says he will vote for you as soon as he can. He is saving the card
             forever.



             Thanks again for your generosity and speed in replying to him.

             Keep up the great work on AGIA and be at arms length with the boys from Conoco , especially
             that Weasel fellow . They are a slippery bunch....



            Regards,

            Jim Weber
