            Have any emails ever been sent out from Stedman ' s, Hoffman ' s, etc offices - to inform
            constituents of any on-going state business activity?    I am sure so...

           Amazing out of all the shenanigans being pulled by lawmakers that he spun this up as a
           "wrong" on admin's part. Unapologetic is our stance, as there is nothing to hide from the
           public on our part, and critics should be asking what is it that any lawmaker is afraid of
           the public knowing... hence their outrage that information was revealed to Alaskans.



           Comm Dept can catch this one if it looks like Wesley will follow through on his threat to
           write a front- pager.

            The guy was a real jerk and Heather Brakes as a witness was outraged.

            It was 9:00 PM and I was working on trying to get a couple of things out

            of the Senate and he interrupted and asked a question about sending

            emails.    I told him it was appropriate and the administration contacts

            Alaskans all the time about issues that impact them. He asked a

            question about databases and I told him I would talk to him in the

            morning.    He acted like he had a gotcha, was very aggressive and he was

            threatening a front page story.



            We will get more information to him right away. I just talked to Nizich

            and he is working with the press office.



            Mike

            Mike- Wesley reported you had a "no comment" comment re: his question

            last night re: 30,000 biz lic addresses used to notify on biz lic fee

            legislation. Did you talk to him yet this morning to follow up? (He

            reported that you told him you'd be happy to talk to him in the morning

            about it.). The accusation is there was a violation of state email

           policy with the activity. He'll need clarification asap before that

            issue gets even more spun up. Pls let me know what Wesley's response

           was/is after you talk to him.
