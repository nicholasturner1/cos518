             Some of these questions have to go through Talis and Barnhill.

             Sharon- don`t answer until I hear back from Nizich, Barnhill, et al. Hopefully they gave you some
             talking points already today. Thanks
             And I don't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it, so please pass this email on
             to him before Sharon returns ADN's call. Thanks

             Governor-

             The Daily News wants to know if we have anything to say about Branchflower. Do you want me to
             say anything new or repeat that you are open to answer any questions?
