         When you took office you said in a speach &quot;Grow More Moose &quot;. When is that going
         to happen? ADF &amp; G in Game unit 20 are hunting cows and calves. Why? Why not
         transplant them to Unit 5 which needs them. or transplant the orphan calves left over from
         a auto accident in Anchorage, Fairbanks or other locations.rn        ADF &amp; G for the
         past several years have been wasting Alaskas wildlife recources. I would like to see our
         managment in our wildlife recources changed. It ADF &amp; G needs to manage wildlife not
         the people.rnrnThank YournRonald JordanrnAnchorage Alaska
