         We will be on the ground about 2 hours. We should arrive in Anchorage at 1:00 pm. I am
         told it is a 2 hour flight from Whitehorse to Anchorage (pretty much the same as from
         Juneau).

         Balash is in Juneau. I need to call him here shortly. We planned to meet up at the
         office today.



          The Premere's office asked if you would feel comfortable having the girls go a short tour
         during our hour meeting in Whitehorse.
