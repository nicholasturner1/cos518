            Hang on to your hats. We got the machine after us now! Sean's filing at noon - DY is one
            angry bear.



            Talis , may I eat those doughnuts that you've been saving for Sean? Your ploy may have
            worked...

                Subject: Earmarks Senator Stevens' clarification - CONFIDENTIAL
                Senator Stevens asked me to let you know that his comments in yesterday's
                ADN are not of recent vintage but reflect an interview that he gave over two
                weeks ago, well before his decision to post all earmarks and the meeting I had
                with him.

                This message was conveyed by the Senator's press secretary, who also said
                that the Senator wonders why ADN saved his comments for such a long time
                before publishing them. Implicit in the message was Senator Stevens concern
                and discontent about how his prior words were used.

                Just wanted you to be aware of this exchange.
