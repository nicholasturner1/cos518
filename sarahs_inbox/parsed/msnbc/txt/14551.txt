          MESSAGE:

          Congratulations on your new baby! And may God bless you for upholding life for every
          citizen! May the Lord Jesus Christ be with you and your family in the days and years
          ahead. I know nothing of your politics except that you took a very personal stand for the
          right to life - for that I applaud you!!!

          Sincerely,

          Dorothy Plantz
