          Governor,



           Later today (10:00 am AK time), governor hickel is going to hold a press availability and
          come out strong against awarding a license to transcanada. Backbone is split with most
          folks on Gottstein's.side (and ours).



           I imagine we will be pressed by media outlets for a response. Is there anything in
          particular you would like to convey? I think the story is going to be overshadowed, but
          we likely can't ignore it. Short and sweet ought to do.

                             Governor Palin Releases Statement on Cowdery Indictment

             July 10, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska -Governor Sarah Plain today released the, following statement
             regarding the indictment against state Senator John Cowdery:

             "It was disturbing to learn that another public official has been charged with violating the public
             trust. I urge Senator Cowdery to step down for the good of the state.

             "Today's news is a good reminder that we must continue to be vigilant in defending Alaska's
             sovereignty against those who would undermine it in an attempt to sell out Alaskans . As we move
             forward , let me remind everyone that this administration is committed to putting Alaskans and
             their interests first, as we develop our resources in a responsible and ethical manner.

             "We are on the right path. I am confident that path will be made more clear and obstacle-free as
             justice prevails In the ongoing FBI investigation. Like many Alaskans, I look forward to closure on
             this disturbing chapter in our state's history."
