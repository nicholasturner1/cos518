              Hello!



              That's just not right- who leaves Hawaii early??!!! Good decision though; it would be
              hard to relax and enjoy the sun, warm sand, tropical smells, drinks w little umbrellas...
              Now you'll just need to go back!! :)



              It would be cool if they were able to meet up- Alex was all happy when he found out you
              guys would be there-and so close! The kid would probably run 5 miles if he had too, he's
              such a goof!



              Did you see my note about decorators on Monday (9-4) it's no problem to reschedule, but I
              wanted to check with you before I made any calls.

              Hi E-

              I hope Bristol found Alex . I think our hotels are just a few doors down.



              I hustled back to Juneau early- felt to guilty and nervous being away w/special session...
              so I'm here. Todd and kids stayed for the wedding that is tonight, they'll return to
              Anchorage late Tuesday. It was flippin' GORGEOUS there!
                                                                1
