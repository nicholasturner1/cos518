              Commissioner Campbell requested that we invite all of the interior mayors. I didn't know he was anti-
              AGIA.

              He is the kind of guy who would show up anyway.

             Why is Doug Isaacson coming ? There is no flooding in the City limits of North Pole...and he was urging
             lawmakers to vote no on AGIA I can get a copy of the letter he signed, if necessary.
