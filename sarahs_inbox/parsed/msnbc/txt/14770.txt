            MESSAGE:

            I know that your eyes won't probably see this, but my heart is stirred after reading about
            the birth of your new-born with Down's Syndrome. I was looking at Yahoo News, and actually
            read the whole article for a change. You have a zeal for the State of Alaska, as well as
            for your family, even though you were referred to as a "maverick" ... brava to a stong
            woman!!!! I just felt the need to "write" to you.
