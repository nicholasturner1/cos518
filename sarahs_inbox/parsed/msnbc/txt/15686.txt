            MESSAGE:

            Hello Governor:




            I an normally in agreement with your guiding principle regarding the size of the State of
            Alaska's government and its budget. However, one of your veto's this year took me by
            surprise.   You vetoed approximately $1M to work on the roads in the Nancy Lake area
             (specfically Kime Lane, Erica Lane, Amy and Linda Lane), and to bring them up to Matsu
            Standards.   Every supervisory entity including the MatSu area road boards, the Borough
            itself, and the State had placed a high emphasis on the necessity for this project.




            Everyone in the area was very upset, and frankly, taken aback by this veto. The area has
            been neglected time and time again with respect to fixing these roads, and we felt that we
            had gained some traction finally with the Road Board, and the Borough and the State. We
            followed all of the rules and processes, and yet, in the end, once again our roads are
            neglected, shoddy, and some of the worst in the area.

                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0018665

           With the State bringing in Billions of dollars with the current price of oil , it seems to
           me that a portion of these funds should be spent statewide upon Education and
           Infrastructure while we can .   I also believe very deeply in saving for the future (ie.
           placing money in the permanent fund ).   But it seems to me that a guiding principle of
           lowering the State ' s budget should be focused upon the recurring expenses of the State,
           and not one - time improvement projects such as this one that is badly needed.




           Please consider replacing this budget item   ( Item # 274, Commerce , House District 15).




           Sincerely,




           Kevin Gray
