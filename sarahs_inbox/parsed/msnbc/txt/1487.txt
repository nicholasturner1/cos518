I ask for that flagging because Pat Daugherty said that's the only way to know what's bogus on their
blog- and I don't blog nor have access to flagging anyway on these devices.

Can someone flag the lie in the blog "sexy highway talk among governors" that claims Trig was in the
fender bender with me- and he wasn't in a car seat on my commute. Sheeeesh.

  I WISH ADN would follow up on that one (as the blogger asks ADN to do) so that I can put that
rumor to rest... Rumor is Walt reported me so I fired him. What an idiot blog entry, very easy to
counter with the truth when half a dozen APD cops responded and witnessed no Trig in vehicle.
