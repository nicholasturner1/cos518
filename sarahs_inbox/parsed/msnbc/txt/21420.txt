              Very good - I'll let Kris know of this too.

             I had a good talk with Melissa Stepovich today. Sounds like she could use help here with
             the "business" community. I offered myself up and asked her to get me scheduled with the
             Fairbanks Chamber (to speak). I am doing Anch Chamber next week.



              Also, I suggested she think strategically about using both of us, whether together or
             separate. I don't usually hear if I've been requested as a backup for you until after you
             decline. Often that's too late as I've already committed somewhere else. I asked Melissa
             to let me know if she's requesting me as your backup on something when she makes the
             request to Janice and I'll at least have it on the radar ahead of time. (I will also see
             if Kelly and Janice are communicating this way.)
