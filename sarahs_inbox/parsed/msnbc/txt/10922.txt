                 Subject: Draft Mulva Letter

               Gov:

               Below is the text of the draft letter we discussed earlier today . If it meets with your approval (and please feel free
               to edit it) we can get it out tomorrow morning . Commissioner Irwin is speaking at the Anchorage Chamber
               tomorrow at Noon-he could talk about it after it has gone to Mulva.

               Let me know how to proceed.

               Joe
