              Subject :                Pebble


              Yikes- why did ktuu report that we ' re negotiating over pebble? I think they got it wrong -
              we know there ' s no negotiating . It's unfortunate that the report made it sound like we're
              thwarting the right of the people to speak /vote on this . They said we approached the
              environmental group to squash it.
