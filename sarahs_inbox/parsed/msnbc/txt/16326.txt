             Hey- no wonder legislature is clustered up- that meeting was downright weird.

             Good morning -



             Rep Craig Johnson just called to invite you to a going-away party for John Tracy this
             Sunday, he'll call back with exact time.



             Many many of the past employees will be attending so he wanted to be sure you were
             included.  It'll be held at Rep Johnson's home   since his wife has worked for Channel 2
             News for 25 years.


                                                                             -
             Address:    12200 Timberland Drive (south Anchorage)



             Kelly
