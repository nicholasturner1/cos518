             Governor:



            Randy has been working with Andy Hall at the Milepost to get them what they need for
            publication and Andy was satisfied.



            Is there someone else who has contacted you that we can take care of?

            The new draft schedule has not been submitted to publications.



            The draft schedule is open for public comment -- written through Jan. 10 (tomorrow) and
            two teleconference scheduled for Jan. 11.



            The schedule may see some adjustments based on the public comment. The final schedule will
            be available no later than Feb. 12. DOT hopes to have it available before that date.



            Here's the link -- I'll copy Tara on this so she can print it.

                 Commissioner Von Scheben:

                I have been communicating with Mr. Hall at the Milepost and Mr. VanKirk (scheduler) at AMHS for the last two
                weeks . He was going to try to move back his publishing date by a few days with the thought that Mr . VanKirk
                could provide him with a schedule for printing in the milepost by the end of January.

                Since developing a new schedule that involves not running all the boats on the usual routes takes 6-8 weeks
                longer to develop than the old schedule , AMHS may want to start the process that much earlier next year to avoid
                these issues. (I believe this will also take some earlier coordination with OMB as the AMHS schedule is closely
                tied to the budget)

                Thank you,

                 Randy

                Governor, Mile Post is OK with the schedule . We advised them it is a one time thing and won't happen next year. I told staff
                to check again with all publications ( including MP again) of the schedule problem and getting it out. AMHS will get back to
                me ASAP. I will let you know the results. LEO
