            remember standing in the Chug3a H ag    c oo        way an paring                     oil and
            gas. issues back when I was with Channel 2 and he was quite critical of Murkowski and his
            naivete in negotiating with people (big oil ) who are used to giving bribes in Russia and
            carrying guns to do business in other areas of the world . He kept saying how strong we
            need to be as a state and not bow down to big oil. Anyway...



             How much time did you get with McCain re: gasline ? Anything that could be a press
            release ? Any promises ? Could we say you spent good amount of time discussing gasline
            issues / ANWR? Did he say that he ' d talk about Alaska concerning an energy plan / policy
            during the campaign and in the White House?

            > Oh, amen. I told John Katz that - we don 't mind at all that Stevens wants to post
            earmark requests (tho evidently Stevens wanted to do this to ding us) because it will
            prove we've only asked for 4 or 5 new ones (totaling 30-something that include
            continuation of old but sensible earmarks with a Federal nexus )... versus the 154 requests
            we inherited from prior administration that Stevens had to deal with.

            efforts are at the request of him and Young - telling us to quit expecting so many federal
            dollars.



            > Back in DC the whole earmark reform issue was thee hot topic - from speaking with
            McCain, Bush, Transportation Secretary Peters, other Govs, etc.
