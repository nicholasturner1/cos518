            These seem to be emails attached to the original email - people's comments. I don't think
            I really need these. Thanks, Janice

           I am extremely fortunate to have been able to be part of this women's conference and was
           could not have done it without the following: Diane Carrier, Sarah Lampe, my brother
           William, my sister Laura Sheldon and Myrna Foster. These people are continually stepping
           forward to make things happen for others. ANS must be proud of sister Sarah Lampe, Grand
           Camp Sargent At Arms who made a trip over to help and who also brought the seal meat that
           everyone enjoyed Saturday! I acknowledge President Micalyn Kunz McGhee and her sister
           Nelly who were very much a part of this picture; they are true inspiration of what ANS is
           all about. Thank you Connie for your continued respect and for checking on items that
           needed to be done; you and Emma really shined. I truly love my mom and after hearing her
                                                                 1

            speak will make more time for this wonderful lady so she can expect visits from me. I am
            glad she is up front and personal; you learn from the best. Last but certainly not least I
            would like to personally acknowledge President Martin; it is a blessing to be working
            under his leadership. His genuine concern and support for Elders, youth, family, ANB/ANS
            and Southeast Native Veterans shows his commitment in making our organization a good one.



            I apologize for not making it in Saturday but had 9 grandchildren I was caring for. Our
            day ended after the free swim for them after 8 PM.



            I want to take this time and remind everyone that the last Native Issues Forum is
            scheduled for April 9th; Senator Kookesh and Representative Bill Thomas. MC Ron Williams.
            Our menu plans include entree items of Roast w/gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cream
            style corn,  spaghetti w/sauteed onions, green peppers and celery, buttered dinner roll.
            Dessert: Cake w/strawberry filling. Pork noodles, bac-o salad, macaroni salad, fruit salad
            and hopefully fresh herring egg salad if it arrives in time from Sitka (donated by Central
            Council). Thank you!
