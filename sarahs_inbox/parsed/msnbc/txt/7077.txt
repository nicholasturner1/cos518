         Gov,



          There is going to be a pre-dinner tour of the ship's engine room and environmental
         control systems.  If you can join in on that, I will be meeting the cruise folks 15
         minutes early at the gangway. If you can't make it, let me know and I won't let them try
         to wait for you.



           Joe
