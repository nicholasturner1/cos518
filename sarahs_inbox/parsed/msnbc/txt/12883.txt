                  Subject: Earmarks/My Draft Op-Ed


                 Per the Governor's request, I have drafted the Op-Ed piece below on Congressional
                 earmarks for my signature.

                 Sharon, I presume that you will take over from here. If the ADN is not interested in
                 publishing because of their prior coverage or otherwise, I believe that other papers
                 might be, particularly Ketchikan, since Lew Williams has published his own version
                 of reality.

                 I will stand by for further comments or direction.
