        I am told it is Chuck and I heard that it may not be his just a friends. He did visit one
        of the agencies (either BLM or DNR) to discuss. Other than that I am short on details and
        was trying not to stir up anything by asking questions (Tom Irwin was also not sure of
        many specifics - location, etc.). I can find out more if you like.



        Sorry about the bombardment of emails tonight.



        Mike

        Hmmmm - no idea what this is about. Is it Chuck Heath or Jim Palin, and where is the
        cabin/land... and I wonder why I've never heard anything about this?

        I did not get a chance to pass this along in person before you left but

        I thought it was something you should know. The state typically objects

        to land conveyances unless there is a clear title. In instances where

        there are questions, BLM will try to clear those by removing the

        structure that can not prove ownership of the land. Somehow your father

        is involved with one of these cases where proof of title has not been

        demonstrated.

        Mike, to keep you informed. BLM is moving forward. Tom



        Hi all,




        Just an update,     on an issue I think you are aware of.




        I received a call from Hans Neiding, Special Asst. to the Secretary of

        the Interior.      Hans provided an update and expressed his concern that

        the State has refused to accept BLM land conveyances due to trespass

        structures on state priority lands (BLM 2009 project). Therefore, BLM is

        beginning to issue trespass citations on these structures. He stated

        Dick had been briefed on one of the trespass issues, but that he has

        been informed that 200 more are planned.



                                                         2

        I confirmed with Wyn, that the state is only willing to accept these

        land conveyances free of encumbrances, as originally agreed. The

        sensitive nature is one of the trespass cabins is owned by the

        Governor's father or father-in-law.




        Tom, I left you a brief message regarding this update.




        Please let me know if action is needed. Thanks!
