               I have posed that question to him. He is going to look around a bit and then let us
               know.

               It was good to see you on Tuesday.

                Ok thanks - I'll be thinking of others, while you also think of replacements
                and/or reconfigurations. Does Sam want to cont working for the state while back
                in AK?

                  Sam Bishop advised me today that he and his wife have decided to move back to
                  Fairbanks. They and their children want to be closer to family and friends. Sam
                  will be leaving the DC office effective July 1.

                  As Allison Nyholm has mentioned , she will be getting married and moving to Salt
                  Lake City. Her last day in the DC office will be sometime in May.

                  I am sorry to loose both of them. They have been excellent public servants, but I
                  respect their decision that family always comes first.

                  I wanted you to be aware of these developments rather than hearing about them

                  from the Alaska grapevine. Of course, their leaving will have a significant impact
                  on the DC office, and I'm beginning to think about competent replacements. If
                  either of you or the other addressees on this email have thoughts about possible
                  candidates, please let me know. In the meantime, I will look around myself both
                  in Alaska and among Alaskans back here.
