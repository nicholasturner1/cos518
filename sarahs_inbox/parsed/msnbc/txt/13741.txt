           What a goof he is... truly annoying.

           Thanks for the info- I'm headed home from Dallas.

            Dear Governor Palin,

                  I just learned that our attorney Tina Otto (who was our Mat maid attorney) is
            leaving to become a Magistrate. I talked to her and she said it was not because of the
            Mat Maid case that she is leaving. However, she noted that apparently Andrew Halcro has
            learned of her new job and put it on his blog. This time, however, he has not added the
            commentary that he had before. He is not claiming she is leaving because of Mat Maid.
            This time he is just reporting it.

                  Talis
