 Subject : rallying the troops

 Are there any specific topics we should be focussed on in terms on op-eds and letter to the
 editor? I'll get to writing if you give me some topics and also send out emails to our good
 supporters. Ideas: Juneau rd, Juneau energy costs, gas tax (although I would need to get the
 specifics on the plan from Tom on this), budget....

 What do you guys think?
