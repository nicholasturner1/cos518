            Awesome!

            Sharon and Rosanne- make sure press knows of the success of Franci's efforts here. As she
            points out, it's good news for Ag in Alaska. DNR and Ag folks need kudos for efforts here
            - and farmers need to be recognized for their patience and tenacious creativity in finding
            markets for dairy.

            Great job Ag!!!

             I just left the new creamery with an autographed and purchased gallon of fresh local
            milk.  They are expecting to process 2400 gallons this evening and another 2400 tomorrow.
            It will be on Fred Meyer shelves tomorrow!

             This is an exciting time for Ag in Alaska!

             Thanks to everyone who made this possible!
