               Newman is now calling me. I will call him back and tell him that we do not have a million
               dollar slush fund and there is no le al appropriation to give the farmers $200,000.

              Governor,

              I spoke to Rep. Neuman yesterday afternoon about his comments and asked him specifically
              what he meant. He said it is his understanding that the governor has "a million dollar
              discretionary account" and could use $200,000 of that to help dairy farmers (specifically
              the group led by Kyle Beus).



              He was emphatic that any more money from the legislature would take until spring, which is
              too late (From today's ADN: "In the meantime, the state Creamery Board on Friday
              authorized a request to the Legislature for up to $200,000 in financial aid for the four
              farmers" ). He's upset that state officials had a problem with the dumping of the milk.
              He said farmers are at the point where there going to have to "take the cows out in the
              field and shoot them."



              He remains disappointed that he cannot get a meeting with you to discuss this issue.
              You'll remember he tried during the special session . He wondered if he'd done something
              that upset you. I told him I had no knowledge of any specific issue and declined to
              speculate.

              I'll stand by for now.

             Russ- pls find out what Nueman meant, speaking on KTUU saying "the guy has discretionary
             funds to help... I look to her to keep MatMaid open".
