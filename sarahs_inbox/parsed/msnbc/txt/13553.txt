            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I was shocked last week to hear that a former Legislative Aide approached my sister at
            church in Wasilla about Privileged orPerson4.. that's the one that got traced back to Lyda's
            staff spreading it.

            and I don't suspect she would.
