            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the additional gift that is going to joining your family. Children are
            one of our greatest natural resources.



           It was with regret that I saw your nomination of Steve Haageson as energy coordinator.
           Under Steve's leadership he was able to; build the worlds largest UPS that will hold the
           power in the core down town Fairbanks for >$39 million, contribute to the Healy clean coal
           fiasco, build an intertie from Healy to Fairbanks for a very high undisclosed price,"It is
           my understanding that it is not being used", under his reign built the additional North
           Pole power plant upgrades "initial budget of $65 million, >$125 million last I saw.

           GVEA has gone in a tail spin since Steve took over. The rate payers will be paying for his
           lack of leadership beyond my lifetime. Leadership/management will make or break any
           company. His record speaks for itself.
