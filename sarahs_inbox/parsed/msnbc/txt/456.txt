  Subject : Security Camera Training at the House Tuesday, May 8th at 10:15am.
  Hello Everyone,

  I have training for the new security camera equipment scheduled for Tuesday, May 8th at 10:15am.
  Lucas is not in town, so Harvy Johnson of Simplex Grinnell will be conducting the training.

  Our system isn't up and running completely like it is in the Capitol, but Harvy will bring his laptop and we
  can either meet in my office or the security room. We're having issues with the House computers not
  having memory in the video cards, so they just need to install them and we'll be up and running.

  Thank you, see you on Tuesday!
  Erika
