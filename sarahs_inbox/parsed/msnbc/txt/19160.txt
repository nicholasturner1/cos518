         Please dont take my asking questions as being agitated .. Just want to know what ' s going on
         and not wanting to react to , as you characterized this , a third - hand statement . ( Anonymous
         at that.)



         I will continue to ask questions.

         The original email went to ADEC, DNR, and PSIO to make sure all of our ears were perked
         up.  Commissioner Hartig is going to make a call to BP later this afternoon to try and
         confirm what ' s going on.



         I didn't mean to get you agitated, I just wanted to give you and the leadership of our
         enforcement agencies a heads - up in the event a press release came out this morning.



         I will confer with commissioner Hartig and get back to you. There is no ask of you here.

         Joe - i have so many questions on this I don't even know where to start and I'm in the
         middle of ASAA activities today... but let me shoot off the questions and I'll cc others
         who may have the answers.




         First: is the rumor true (if not we're wasting our time)?




         Has the COS been informed, and Communications people, so I can be presented factual info
         and I can pro-actively be ready with a statement?



         Where's the PSIO and DNR on this?



        Many more questions... I'll stand by for answers to these first though.

        Pat Galvin got an email early this morning from Tom Wright's wife on the same subject.
        Either he told her the same thing that he told me, or their source is the same person. In
        that case, I would suspect that person is their son.

          Who?



          See, it will be important to know the legitimacy of this rumor so our overseeing agency
          can be properly prepared.

          It was third - hand . A former staffer with a buddy on the Slope told me .     His contact is
          somebody at BP that ' s up there .. . and the BP person learned of it this afternoon.

         Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
         fixes...

         I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M    Hill that are currently under contract
         with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work    at PBU are going to be laid off--more
         than 100 people. An announcement is expected to be     made tomorrow and the personnel
         informed.  The reason as it was explained to me is    that there are safety concerns with
         winter work.  Sorry I don't have more details, but    this was passed on to me third-hand
         just a few minutes ago.
