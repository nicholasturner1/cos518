             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin, thank you for your attendence at the Mears Junion Honor society induction
             last night. Stephanie is my youngest daughter to have heard both mine and Cindy's constant
             reminders of the rewards of hard work and good grades. Having a successful female role
             model at the induction was an excellent teaching moment for us.



             I happened to be standing next to Todd and Trig.during the ceremony and had a chance to
             congratulate Todd on healing up as well as noting how proud Alaskans are of your whole
             family and especially Track's service committment.



             Having had the opportunity to work on several projects with you during your term as Mayor
             of Wasilla is something that I appreciate. You have a trememdous amount of support from
             our constituants, and we look forward to several years of supportive involvement as our
             Governor. Thanks again.
