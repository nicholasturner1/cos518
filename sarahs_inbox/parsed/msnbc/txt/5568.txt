         Reminder that Governor Hickel, Malcolm and David will be in Juneau on

         Tuesday to speak w/legislators on AGIA. They would like a briefing with the

         gasline team beforehand (that morning). Marty is aware. Meg is going to

         take it from here.

          Kris,




          In a phone conversation with Malcolm this morning (he's in L.A.) he asked me

          to let you know that Governor Hickel and David Gottstein will be in Juneau

          all day May 1 and are prepared to testify before the House and Senate

          Finance Committees.        (I left. messages for Representative Meyer and Senator

          Stedman on Tuesday morning but have had no replies.)




          FYI, Governor Hickel, Malcolm ,      and David will arrive in Juneau at 9:31 p.m.

          on Monday , April 30, and will leave to return to Anchorage at 7:47 p.m. on

          Tuesday , May 1 .    They have reservations at the Baranof Hotel.




          Yvonne
