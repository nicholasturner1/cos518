             Subject: Customary Trade/Subsistence
             I want to make sure that you have been advised that, in the aftermath of the
             Governor's meeting with Deputy Secretary Lynn Scarlett, the Federal
             Subsistence Board has been directed to move forward with its work on
             customary trade policies notwithstanding the original objections from the
             Justice Department. We specifically asked in the meeting that this occur.

             So, as I understand the current situation, the FSB , pursuant to previous
             Secretarial directives , is working on customary trade, has almost completed
             its work on closure policies , and is also examining its internal decision
             making process to respond to State concerns about fairness and
             transparency. In my opinion , we should continue and even intensify the
             State ' s dialogue with the FSB on these issues.

             Please let me know if we can help further from this end.


             Please note that, my email address has changed . My new email address is
