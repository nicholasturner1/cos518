               Thanks so much- I'll get on to reading these asap . Love the title: Slow Govt Growth...
               that's got to be the silver lining in the increased budget message.

              Governor - attached are talking points that Mike and I have been working on today along
              with two new charts for tomorrow. Beth, the charts are ready to go! There is also the 2-
              page fiscal summary - it will be one of the handouts that I will go over but too much for
              a chart!  Let us know if you would like to walk through this information tomorrow. I'll
              be here early afternoon until I get on the plane! Karen
