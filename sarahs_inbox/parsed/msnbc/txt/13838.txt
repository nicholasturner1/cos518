               Governor:

               We met yesterday with Randy Ruaro and DOT/PF including Commissioner von Scheben. We are
               preparing a timeline and will be looking to brief you in a week or so, depending on your
               availability.

          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




               We'll look forward to getting on your schedule for a comprehensive briefing.



               On another note, we'll be giving PSEA a best and final offer today. I'll make a decision
               after a meeting at 9:30. a.m. as to what that is going to be. Privileged or Personal Material Reda

            Governor :

            I just heard through Randy Ruaro that one of the maritime units - Inland Boatmens Union
            (IBU) is sending out strike ballots to its members. Apparently on the radio, a member is
            quoted as saying that "the entire west coast" maritime organizations will join in the
            strike.  We'll run that down, but wanted you to know in the meantime.
