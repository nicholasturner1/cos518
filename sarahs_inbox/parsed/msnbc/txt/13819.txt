             Governor,  we will work on some type of press release because it is good news about the
            progress.  The closer we get to the end, and there is a large amount (years) of work
            remaining, the land selections get much harder because of things like over selections and
            complications with clear title.

              How can we let Alaskans know the significance of this? It' s good news and it does benefit
             them.



              Also , is anything new on the idea ( bad idea ) of burning down the cabins/emergency
             shelters that are sitting on BLM lands throughout some parts of Alaska ? I still hear
             questions on what I can do to stop it.

             Governor , info if asked .     The State has received over 3 million acres from the Feds in
            the last two years .   Doesn't seem like too much for the size of Alaska but this is around
            the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined .     The 82 , 608 acres is in addition to what
            we have already received - this is the land within the TAPS Pipeline corridor in the
            Copper River Basin that was freed up through the discussions with BLM on their East Alaska
            Management Plan .   This 82 , 608 acres is not actually traversed by the pipeline , but to the
            east and west .   Some is land in the Alaska Range ( just west of the Delta River ) that the
                                                                 2

             mining folks are excited to get

               and the rest is near the Gulkana Glacier . - the home of the Arctic Man snow machine
             race . BLM and state people have been working hard on getting title to Alaska lands.



               The amount of land still owed the state is approx 11 million acres.



               BLM and the state have also had significant success in obtaining uncontested title for
             Alaska to numerous navigable waterways in Alaska through recordable disclaimers.

              Governor ,   I don't think you have to do anything but I have asked our Mine / Land/Water
            people to give us a summary of all BLM lands transferred to the state over the last couple
            of years .   I think it is now over 3-million acres .  I will get an update out tomorrow.
