           Georgette,

           Thanks for the "congrats"! Trig is amazing.



           Re: the budget, not sure where you got the information or numbers you mention in your
           email, but we invite you to look at the actual DPS budget and the growth you'll see there..
           For further clarification on the numbers you seem to be referring to, feel free to contact
           my special assistant on DPS budget, Mr. Randy Ruaro (he's cc'd in this email).



           Thank you for contacting me, have a good weekend.

           - Governor Sarah Palin

           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,



           I have long supported you and have absolutely been in love with how you

           conduct yourself and conduct business for our State. I have been behind

           your husband in his desire to go back to the Slope, stating it's no

           one's business but yours and his. I have applauded you, flying out to

           be at your son's graduation (my son serves in the U. S. Navy). I have

           laughed and cried, and more recently read and viewed the pictures of

           your newborn son, adoring how precious he is and knowing he's being born

           into a loving and strong family.



           Having said all of that, Governor, this time you have missed the mark by

           a mile with your "unconditional support" of Joe Schmidt. All the good

           things you've done. . .have been undone in one fell swoop in my eyes.

           Everyone knows you went to high school together - so what are you

           saying?    That all of these people are liars and have some ax to grind?

           I do not have family members who work in corrections - this is just

                                                           2

          plain old common sense. You seriously need to rethink your stance on

          this issue.     Corrections is in a world of hurt. This man not only

          didn't ask for more money for corrections (that's fine), but he GAVE

          some BACK? And now you don't believe the people who have given him a no

          confidence vote? Come on!



          I didn't even write to you when you cut the DPS budget by 1.2 million

          dollars, and I DO have a family member who serves this State as a State

          Trooper.    That was bad enough.. .but this .... this is just wrong and

          believe me, you need to seriously think about rectifying this situation,

          despite the fact that this jerk is your long time friend. Do the right

          thing.     Practice what you preach, Governor.
