          MESSAGE:

         I am a third year student at the University of Texas School of Law. I have written John
         McCain to express my support for Mrs. Palin for his Vice President. I also wanted to
         express my opinion to you. I strongly believe Mrs. Palin should be McCain's running mate.
         I hope and plead that she push the issue with McCain and accept the offer if it is given
         to her.  McCain/Palin 2008!!!!!
