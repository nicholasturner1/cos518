                      To The Political Criminals of Alaska:

                      As I sit here in my office in Waco, Texas , I have just watched the video of the aerial murders of
                      wolves, and am quite upset over it. What I cannot understand is, and why in the hell, and to
                      what extent are you accomplishing in completing these inhumane, morbid and gruesome acts of
                      killing innocent wolves? While I'm here in Texas and you are in Alaska, it is very hard for me
                      to say how I feel about people such as yourself. Can you not honor what the people of Alaska
                      want? I understand that they have opposed killing wolves in this manner . I guess it is true about
                      people in power, THEY DO AS THEY PLEASE, whether it be legal or not!

                      STOP YOUR DISGUSTING, ILLEGAL, AND GRUESOME ACTS OF KILLING WOLVES
                      (AND BEARS) BY USING PLANES. I would love to say "thank you for your time," but you
                      and I both know that your time means absolutely nothing to me. Your existence in this world
                      seems wasted due to your hatred of one of the most beautiful creatures in nature. I usually do
                      not have a say in much of anything due to being very shy and standoffish , but I can honestly say
                      that the disgust I have for you , and for your actions, brings out an entirely different person.

                      Seriously think about trying to correct the many wrongs you have done and are about to do with
                      these aerial killings. In the video, it mentioned how other states would eventually do these
                      killings, whether it is for sport, or just for the fun of it. Bring it to Texas and I will blast your
                      sorry ass back to Alaska and let the bears have you.

                                                                                   Sincerely yours,
