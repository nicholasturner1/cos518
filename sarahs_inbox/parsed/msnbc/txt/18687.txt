                    Re:       SCHIP Reauthorization

                    We would like to thank you for your continued efforts to ensure that the State Children's Health Insurance
                    Program (SCHIP) is reauthorized this year. As we discussed during the NGA meetings in Washington D.C.
                    and Michigan, authorization for SCHIP expires at the end of September 2007 and its reauthorization is a
                    priority for all governors.

                    Over the past several months NGA has called upon Congress and the Administration to reauthorize this
                    critical legislation and avoid short term extensions that would result in coverage shortfalls in several
                    states . We are committed to communicating governors' position on SCHIP to Congress and the
                    Administration, but our voice is no substitute for direct contact between governors and their
                    state delegations. We ask for your continued assistance by working with us collectively through NGA and by
                    independently educating your federal representatives regarding the importance of SCHIP to your state. To
                    that end NGA has provided a tool kit for use by your press shop to raise the issue in your state and with your
                    delegations. The NGA tool kit can be accessed at http://www.subnet.nga.org/schi/

                    We are hopeful that by working together we can make SCHIP reauthorization a priority for Congress
                    and secure a long-term reauthorization of SCHIP this year.
