                 Subject: Telephone Call - Carl Clausen

               Governor - I just received a phone call from Carl Clausen stating that it is urgent that he speak with you. He
               apparently has been trying to reach you on your cell phone.

               He stated that the 10 percent alcohol tax was pulled from the ballot based on a deal he has made . He wants this
               not to just go City wide but State wide . Important the he gets this information to you now. I have copied Kris on
               this email so that Kris can call Carl back if you would like. Thanks, Janice

               Contact Carl Clausen Privileged or (cell)
