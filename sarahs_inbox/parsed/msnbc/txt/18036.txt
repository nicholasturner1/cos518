            Below are the former AG's that have confirmed their attendance at Tuesday 's luncheon (Captain Cook
            Hotel).

            Douglas Baily (1989-1990)
            Bruce Botelho ( 1994-2002)
            Harold Brown ( 1985-1986)
            D.A. Burr ( 1966-1967)
            Charles Cole ( 1991-1994)
            Wilson Condon ( 1980-1982)
            Norman Gorsuch (1973-1974 & 1982-1985)
            John Havelock (1970-1973)
            George Hayes ( 1962-1964)
            John Rader ( 1959-1960)

            I will prepare a brief outline . As I understand, this event will be somewhat informal with a very brief
            opening and introduction by Governor Palin (Meg will prepare brief talking points ). The objective is to
            hear from the former AG's on the highlights of their careers and their experiences.
