           I will follow up with Joe. I like your idea of providing a scoop to Channel 2.

            Sharon, I had a Mat Maid conf call this afternoon. During the call the subject of
           Stephanie's inaccurate reporting came up. Both Joe Austerman and Kristan have had problems
           with her...her refusal to listen and to steer the facts in the wrong direction to
           sensationalize the story. Joe spent about an hour on the phone today with her and her
           editor about the innaccuracies in today's story, wanting a correction. Specifically about
           the $600k. She even acknowledged during the call that the comment (quote) wasn't what Joe
           said but what she inferred from the conversation. It has gotten to the point that neither
           want to talk to her anymore. And, she calls Kristan multiple times each day. I told the
           group I'd follow-up with you to see if you have suggestions. Zencey? We may have some
           information to scoop and my thought was we'll go w/Channel 2 so there will be more
           accurate reporting and we can address the misinformation. Please talk w/Joe A. for more
           details on his conversation and I'll share the rest tomorrow or by phone today.
