                 Subject: operating budget

               Man, Gara is asking great questions on the op budget roll out. They were trying to skate by w/out mentioning
               which governor proposals were removed. Gara has already dinged them on the CBR approp and the Head Start
               approp.

                  Subject: Phase 2 Governor's House Water Pipe Replacement Project June 1 - August 15, 2008

                Hello Governor and Todd,

                I met with the project managers , engineers and contractors to review the upcoming plumbing project. I've
                attached a copy of a basic overview of Phase 2 of the Water Pipe Replacement Project and also copied it below.
                Please note that there are a couple of questions that I have in regards to the project. If you would like detailed
                information I can get copies of the plans and project schedule , if not I'll have a set in the office . I'm happy to
                answer any questions or address any concerns that you may have.

                Thank you,
                Erika

                                                                                                              Page 2 of 2


                    s The House will not be livable, hotel/living accommodations would be arranged for the First
                      Family during their time in Juneau.


                Basement- garage, family room, shop, mechanical room
                1St Floor- Library and Ballroom
                2nd Floor- Master Bedroom closet, Master bath and Family Room bath
                3rd Floor- West & East Suite bathrooms, Linen closets.

                This is a tight schedule with many unknown factors that can cause delays to the project. During the first
                phase of the project contractors had to work around House events, including the Open House and other
                holidays where they did not have access to the House for at least 2 weeks. With these interruptions and
                unexpected work, phase one of the project was still completed very close to the scheduled completion
                date. During the second phase there will not be events scheduled at the House, as this phase is more
                invasive to the public and living areas and the water will be shut off to the entire building. Given the
                track record of the contractors work during phase one I don't foresee any major delays with phase two.
