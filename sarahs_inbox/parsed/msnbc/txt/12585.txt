            MESSAGE:

            I saw you on my local news channel this morning. I love your ideas about tapping our own
            natural resources.



            After reading your bio and about your views and the ccomplishments you have made in
            Alaska,  I think you would make a great VP.



            I wish we had you in California because we could use your help!
