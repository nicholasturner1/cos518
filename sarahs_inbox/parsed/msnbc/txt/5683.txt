              Dear Governor Palin
                  I hope all is going well for you and your family in Juneau . Congratulations to Todd and his
              teammate for their win of this years Iron Dog!

                   I would like to extend an invitation to you to make a brief welcoming address to the eight teams
              competing in this years NCAA Division I National Riffle Championship Event in Fairbanks on March
              10th. The event will conclude around 6pm on the 10th and the organizers would like the welcome
              address and presentation of the big team award to happen at 6:15pm . If time allows you have been
              invited to see the last half hour of the event . If you would like to stay after the awards presentation, for
              as long or as little as you would chose to , that would be great too.

                  I know you are a big fan of sports and this is truly a historical showcase event for our State and our
              University. If we win , it will be even a sweeter award to present . Let me know what will need to be done
              to make this happen as it will be a great event to attend.

              Take care and good luck with everything!
              Ramona
