        I
               SP: Ok- as you are my witness , I'll commit to just not listening to Fagan anymore. His
               comments yesterday were just WAY too much.



               Enjoy DC!   May you be refreshed!

              Fagan ' s going off the deep end with his intimation ( that we're "whores") in yesterday's
              rant. I didn't believe what people told me he said until I heard. it myself.



              It was almost " good " to hear it though - it allowed me to put a nail in the coffin and
              resolve to never listen in again.

               I heard the "... bunch of crack whores running to the sugar daddy" comment from Fagan this
               morning.

               Unbelievable.



               What's the difference between what he just called the State's team and what Don Imus
               called the basketball team when HE said the women were "nappy-headed ho's".



               Fagan was talking about resources and budget spending - and calling those in leadership
               "whores ". That' s me, Kris , Karen Rehfeld , Marty Rutherford, Sharon, Annette , Karleen,
               Tara ... etc.




               He is sick and should not get away with this one.



               This one is unbelievable.
