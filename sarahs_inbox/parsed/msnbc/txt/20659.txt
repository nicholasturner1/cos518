            Dear Senator Palin,




           I just read an article that informed me about your little one whose Norse name, Trig,
           means "brave victory." We have a special son as well, developmentally delayed for life by
           a stroke at birth, he is now 19 years old and has been God's gift to us.




           Thank you and your husband for your testimony. Our country needs more families like you.




                                                                                                             PRA GSPOI 0023583

           My wife Sue and I, think your testimony and solid character would be a good match for the
           McCain's vacant vice-position.
