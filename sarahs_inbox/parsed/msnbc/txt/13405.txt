             I'm tweaking Lyda's letter slightly- I'll bring in changes and assume we release our
             answer to her and the public today.

             Dang- ADN kinda beat us to the punch in today's editorial... we're wording it a lot better
             than they did tho as we point out the Senate's blunders through a more sensible process
             they could have used during regular sess to deal with the bills.
