           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           I live in SC but I just viewed an article on the birth of your child. Thank you for being
           an insipation to other parents. I am sure your family will be enriched by your child.



           I am not a parent, but have known folks with special needs children and it is a wonderful
           thing to see how they bond and raise their child.



           Cathy McGuire
