         B and C has done a lot of research on it already - i didnt know if you knew Privileged or or
         not when i forwarded u the email on Privile s potential red flag. Seems like going with
        Privileged or ^ is fine - again, i assume e 's related to Privileg

         It is hard for me to say. I received a message about Privile which mentioned the option of
                                      I dont now Privile g ed or but Privile used to work for
        Privileaed o and Privileged or Pers                                                   ced orPe]
        is a big hunter an ac i.ve in AOC. I don't know a seat requirements or who else is on
        the list to see the big picture. I can go back through my email today to see if there is
        something more comprehensive from Frank. If there is, I would have missed it. I will
        probably need to touch base with Frank to get the latest, which I will do today.

         Yes the appointments are done but the presser was going Mon so we could send the cacfa
         names at the same time . My understanding was all appointees and unsuccessuls for D&A
         Council were notified yesterday by 3pm , apparently she was not reached . I'll call her
         now.



         I did not hear back from Mike on cacfa so we will send this presser out Monday regardless.
