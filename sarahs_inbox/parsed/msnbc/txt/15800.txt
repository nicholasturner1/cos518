              Thanks for your response to my suggestion . Another thought about a coin -- it could be covered with a
              ceramic coating , with the same colorful theme on one surface.

               BTW - Your name has been considered for over two months as a running mate for McCain . I do hope it
               happens. It would be a very good choice for you both.
