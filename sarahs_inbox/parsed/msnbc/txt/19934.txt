            Janice- I forgot to THANK YOU for hooking us up with the baby jogger for the photo shoot
            the other day! Thanks!

              And Tom for working on that shoot also. It was a weird experience, but you two made it
            smoother than it would have been otherwise.

              See you in a few hours - and the kids should be traveling down tomorrow if we find them
            seats. My mom will be meeting them in Juneau at some point so she can do some tourist-y
            things with them between any First Family events.
