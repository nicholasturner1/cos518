                I am an Alaskan pioneer, and have written a book which is now published and will be
             released nation wide mid March.   Under separate cover I am sending a signed copy of the
             book to Sarah Palin at her Anchorage address with a copy of an article written about me in
             the Anchorage Times 20 years agol   I am now 86 years old, and I thought Sarah would
             appreciate the book!




             Please make sure that she receives the book!              Thank you!
