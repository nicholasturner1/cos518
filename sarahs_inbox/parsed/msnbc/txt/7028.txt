        I agree with Tom. The folks on the distribution list from the email on Friday need to be
        given a very strong message that these are internal documents, and they must take personal
        responsibility to ensure that the messages do not go out. They can't forward messages and
        send them to staff, they can't have staff manage their emails, otherwise they will not be
        included in future discussions and they will useless in doing their jobs.



        If they want to forward the request to staff, they need to take the time to write their
        own email to staff, which does not carry on the chain of previous emails. Also, if they
        choose to send it to staff, they bear all the responsibility to ensure that the staff
        understands that outside release of the information will not be tolerated. This is not
        being secretive or non-'open and transparent', it is simply to make sure the public gets a
        full clear message and not misinformation because things come out in dribs and drabs.



        Usually, this type of protocol enforcement is done by the Chief of Staff. Is this
        something Mike can do on Thursday?

       We talked about this last night. One likely possibility is it came from the request Steve
       sent to all the Commissioners asking for suggestions on energy. This got a wide
       distribution.



       We need to make sure all commissioners have a method where only they have access to
       certain draft emails and they keep in progress , draft ideas confidential . Maybe we can
       comment on it to a Commissioner only, no staff portion of a Cabinet meeting.



       As a side note: I am making a quick trip to Fairbanks this morning so I can attend
       Christopher's 8th grade graduation.  Will be back later this afternoon. God bless. Tom

       We've had a few emails end up in reporters and leggies' hands this past week. Anyone know
       how the press got ahold of Steve's email from Friday, asking for input on energy plan?
