            Hi Kari,

            Just a quick note to pass on to the Governor.

            Palmer City Council passed an AGIA resolution last night. This was brought forward by Mayor
            Combs and well supported by all.

            Mat-Su Assembly passed an AGIA resolution last night too with a few minor amendments. This
            was of course brought forward by Mayor Menard and Assembly member Cindy Bettine.

            Michael A. Carson says pass AGIA and the Ethics Bill!
            Roscoe Wilke says stick to your guns, pass AGIA!

           Thanks and have a good day!

           Colleen
