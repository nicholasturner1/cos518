        And I am just acknowledging now that I did receive this... thanks. I think

        it's such a great message for the near future.

        If we get to replace Vic with someone from my home district, something to

        start thinking about in terms of messaging:



        I will appt someone with the acknowledgement that I believe it needs to be

        an even playing field when the seat is open for election next yr. My

        appointment won't be the usual: "The governor wants to appoint a loyalist

        who will receive her endorsement in the next election".



       Respecting balances of power, it' s the voters ' choice whom they want to

       represent them, and I will responsibly select Vic' s replacement with some

                                                               1

        humbleness - letting the chosen individual know that it's a free -for-all (if

        you will!) when and if they choose to actually run for the seat after their

        appointment. Things get out of balance if the appointing authority abuses

        her office's power and appts based on that person's future electability

        and/or loyalty.
