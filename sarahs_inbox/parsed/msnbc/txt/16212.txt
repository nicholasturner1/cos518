           Governor , Kelly,

           We may need your help but currently we are calling Senator French to discuss the problem
           with him before we do anything else. We want to hear his reaction in order to inform our
           response.  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Marty

           We do need you to help, so I'm asking. Re: any relationship with Lesil that can be tapped.
           I'll make sure Pat, et al will cc you in on requests for help. I don't always have the
           opportunity to see who's cc-d in on AGIA updates, concerns, etc. and sometimes just assume
           that all needed parties are tapped. In any case with issues involving legislators it will
           be helpful to have your assistance. Thanks

             I got a call tonight from Wesley Loy wanting a comment on a "proposal" from

            Lesil to bring in an MIT mediator to work out the differences between the

            Producers, TC, and the Administration prior to the AGIA vote. He said that

            Lesil told him that she planned to send a letter tomorrow to Ralph & Charlie

            asking them to bring in the MIT mediators for a couple of days to try to

           work something out.

             I reiterated to him my response to Lesil during the hearing that we don't

            see anything in the AGIA License that will be a barrier to geting the

            Producers into the project, but it is important for the state to set the

           parameters for any discussions by passing the License. Without the License

            things are too wide open to expect to get anywhere with.a mediator.

             Wesley asked if I thought a couple days of mediation could help. I

            reminded him that the previous admin negotiated with the Producers for two

            and a half years, and ended up with a deal rejected by the legislature. We

           need the legislature and Admin to stablish the terms of the discussion

            through the AGIA license.

             He asked if we would participate in the mediation, and I said there was no

            formal proposal, but the legislature needs to complete the process they

           started last year, and make an up or down vote on the license.

             He then said it would be a private session, and I said no way.

             I'll check with Hollis tomorrow, and call Lesil. I'll let you know what I

           hear...
