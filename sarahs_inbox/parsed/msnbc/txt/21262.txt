        Subject :                 Schedule for Tuesday, 10.16


        Governor - You have a request from the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals
        to give a Welcome. This is the 41st Annual Fall Principals Conference. The Conference
        started on Sunday and goes through Tuesday, 10.16.07. I explained to the Executive
        Director that you were not available to do a Q and A on the panel. They are requesting
        just a brief welcome to the group. They have given us two times to work with. Either @
        10:00 a.m. right before General Session begins or @ 12:30 p.m. - they will break for lunch
        at that time. Expected attendance is 300-400.
