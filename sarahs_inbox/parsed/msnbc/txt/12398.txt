             Spoke about Off Shore leases , relieving fears of coastal communities re: potential
             impacts ... specifcially Chukchi Sea leases.



             Off Shore revenue shares that he supports for AK.


I
             Perhaps it ' ll be a matter of weeks until polar bear listing is settled . They dont have
             much time before lawsuit kicks in ... we'll live w their decision , hope it ' s not listed...
             need to know tho so we can deal with potential impacts asap.



             Btw, sat with Cheney for entire State dinner last night . Talked all about gasline and
             relationships with industry.

            Robert Dillon just called to find out what transpired in the Governors ' meeting with
            Secretary Kempthorne . I told him that we don ' t know but said that I would inquire about
            whether there is anything you want to say. Please let me know if you want to communicate
            something directly or want me to do so.



            Incidentally ,    I thought his story today concerning his interview with you was quite good.
