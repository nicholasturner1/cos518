             Good Afternoon Commissioner's:

             I apologize for not getting this information to you sooner.

             Kwethluk will be holding an opening ceremony for their clinic on Tuesday, August 7th. The new clinic
             was started in the fall of 2006 when the last barge brought material up the Kuskokwim River to the
             village. Because of the population (721) and the number of patient encounters, a larger 3,200 square foot
             clinic was built to serve the people there with exam rooms, a dentistry office, sleep-over quarters,
             behavioral health office, a pharmacy room, waiting area , bathrooms and an office.

             Funding for the clinic was as follows
             Denali Commission: $ 1,711,842,
             A matching grant from HUD in the amount of $196,479
             An IHS Medical Equipment grant for $ 305,303.

             YKHC designed and built the clinic using the force account methodology, hiring local labor. The clinic will
             be owned and operated by the Kwethluk IRA Council. There were between 5 and 6 local hires working
             on the job at any one time.

             If you are interested in attending the opening ceremony for this clinic in Kwethluk , please let me know
             ASAP so we can make the arrangements, or if you prefer to attend one later in the month, Klpnuk will
             also have an opening ceremony that is tentatively scheduled for Monday, August 27, 2007.

             I am including flight information from Anchorage to Bethel and return if you are interested.

             Alaska Airlines
             Flight 41 - Anchorage to Bethel, leaves at 6:00 a.m.
             Flight 46 - Bethel to Anchorage, leaves at 8:30 p.m.

             There are. other flights but I think these are the.only ones that would work if you wanted to do a day trip.
