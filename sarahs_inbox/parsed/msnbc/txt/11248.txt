             Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 17th, 2008




             Dear All:



             An ACE charter delivered five drums of #1 heating oil, five drums of #2

             marine diesel, and one drum of hydraulic fluid yesterday to Nikolski.

             Homes that had been without heating oil are now warm again.



             The Magone Marine vessel, the Redeemer, took on 15,000 gallons of #2

             marine diesel and 11,000 gallons of #1 heating oil last night. Weather

             permitting; the estimated time of arrival in Nikolski is 5pm Anchorage

             time, this evening. Off-loading is intended to begin upon arrival.



             A new update will follow tomorrow. Please let me know if you need any

             more information.



             Karen Pletnikoff
