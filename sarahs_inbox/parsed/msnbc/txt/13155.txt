            Just insisted that "the governor insisted the shooting ranges be put back in the budget",
            while on the floor. Gene had to object. Lyman's way off-base, I'm the one who cut the
            shooting/gun club(s) out of last year's capital, and have not insisted on putting any in
            this year's budget... He needs to be held accountable for saying such things.
