             This was done differently, involving students - so maybe this will be considered
             differently, and can credit the student government participants.

             Governor,



             Regarding yesterday's event -- we were going to send out a presser this

             morning to get better media coverage. Need to see Andy's photos - we can

             attach some. Will get it to you in 15-20 minutes.



             Sharon tells me we haven ' t been getting much media coverage out of

            pressers on bill signings unless it ' s something pretty big. We got a bit

            of coverage out of the revenue sharing release, for example.
