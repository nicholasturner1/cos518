          Governor:



          Mike Nizich and I spoke with Leo this morning. In a nutshell, Leo is moving Frank
          completely off of the airport negotiating team and back to highways. This frees Frank up
          to prepare for special session issues, like repairs and upgrades to the Dalton Highway,
          and to focus on roads issues.



          Christine will be on the negotiating team. Leo said that just as he did with Frank and
          John Torgerson, he will make final decisions on negotiating terms. I think this gets
          Christine all the normal areas of responsibility a Deputy Commissioner of aviation would
          usually have.



          Leo said he was already working on these changes before we called.



          Randy
