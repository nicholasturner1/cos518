           Just a head's up- my suspicions that the CON may be included in corruption probes. Murky
           and Gilbertson stopped any flexibility in CON laws that Providence didn't want, then
           Gilbertson got the top-dog gig at Providence, then was Murky's fundraiser, now is lobbying
           Karleen and others hard to continue squashing CON reform. Head's up.



           I met him for the first time a few weeks ago- he introduced himself by adding: "How's my
           best friend, Mike Tibbles? He's my best friend in the world...". It was odd.

          Did u see on the blog that Gilbertson was one of Murkowski's campaign fundraisers? It's an
          intersting list... all full of our friends. Kris- pls pass on to Anna that bit of info.



           I have a feeling CON is going to be the next corruption cluster.

           Ran into Dyson at airport, he says there will be a couple more people dinged this month. I
           know we've heard it before, but maybe this is legit. And confidential.
