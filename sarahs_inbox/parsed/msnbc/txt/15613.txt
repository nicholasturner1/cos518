           I understand and agree completely!         And I promise to make the invite bare bones and
           unenthusiastic.  :-)

           Grrrrrrr. I guess we do - I am just so extremely disappointed in his lack of enthusiasm to
           work with this administration and his untruthfulness lately. It's been escalating and is
           so disappointing because he's not being fair to his constituents, nor to the hard working
           AGIA team, etc. Yet he'll want a spotlight on Monday.

            he'll no doubt be too busy to attend, as he was this week during our AGIA forum.

            Hi Governor,



            Sharon L. is about to send out a media advisory on the bill signing ceremony for Monday.
           Wanted to double-check with you on Huggins?



            Just so you know, about 20 or so military members will be present.



            Thanks, Kelly
