            I agree - I do npt support their idea. I had not heard they were thinking about this. Mike
            Tibbles and Russ- pls make sure they know my opinion on this, because the $2 million will
            go the way of Stedman's Gravina money and other items that shouldn't be in the budget. Let
            me know who you reach and convince on this before they wrap up the budget. Thanks

            I read in this morning's Fairbanks News-Miner that the Legislature wants to appropriate $2
            million to itself for a national conference and public relations campaign to educate
            Americans about the impacts of a polar bear listing under the Endangered Species Act.
