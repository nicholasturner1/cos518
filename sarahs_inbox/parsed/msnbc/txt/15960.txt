          Comm Campbell: looks like while in Fairbanks on Friday for AGIA I'll be on base for a bit
          and can sign anything military/veterans related. Pls let Kelly know if you have any ideas
          on that. I see we do have a few military-related bills (like PFD) we can take care of
          there, and if you have any other ideas to capitalize on the on-base opportunity we'll have
          that day please let us know. Thanks!
