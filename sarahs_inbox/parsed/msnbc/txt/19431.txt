            Were replacing Walt with Chuck Kopp from Kenai . It's all good. Except we asked Walt to
           move to the ABC Board Ex Dir position so he could utilize his talents and connections with
           Rural Ak and help address the bootlegging problem ( leading to horrendous other problems)
           in our villages ... he said no to that offer . Chuck starts on Monday.
