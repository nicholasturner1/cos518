           Keller asked to resign

           WASILLA -- The Wasilla City Council voted late Monday night to approve a resolution asking
           Mayor Dianne M. Keller to resign.



           The decision came after hours of testimony from the public, Keller and other city
           officials involved in a damaging report from an independent law firm accusing some in the
           city of acting inappropriately in dealings with a private developer.
