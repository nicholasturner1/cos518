             Governor/Mike:

              I'll be out there as well.

             On another note, I see you're meeting with AML. Mike can brief you more

              fully of course, but I am meeting with most FBX legislators and some

             Finance members today regarding AML's proposal to increase the State's

             share of what it is paying for PERS/TRS relief. We're doing an

             assessment to see if FBX's and AML's position has any support/traction

             among legislators who are most familiar with the issue.



             When I visited senator Stedman Friday, Cathie Wasserman and Ray

             Gillespie were meeting with his staff Miles Baker. Senator Stedman

             reaffirmed to me that he is not interested in reopening SB 125. Miles

             told me he said the same thing to AML.



             I'll provide an update at the end of the day today as to who all I've

                                                                     1

             met with to see if there's ANY support for the FBX and AML position of

             increasing the amount of State PERS/TRS contribution.
