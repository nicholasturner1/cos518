        Thank you so very much for all you did for the football players. I sincerely hope they
        appreciate all your efforts - I certainly do!



        Let's schedule the Juneau kids for the week of Sept 21 or Sept 28. If coaches like the
        "night before game" meals, you guys pick the Thursday and I'll look forward it.



        Thank you!!!
