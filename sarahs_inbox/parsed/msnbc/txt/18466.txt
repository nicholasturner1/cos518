         Governor - I will firm up the opto appointments for Friday and put in the Lt. Gov also.
         The KFQD talk show is scheduled for a call in at 10:30-10:45 a.m. tomorrow (Wed.).



        If the weather does not cooperate for the Blackhawk filming tomorrow they will do it up in
        Anchorage either on Thursday or Friday of this week.



        Hope your having a good flight. Janice
