Hi Todd,



Hope you had a wonderful vacation with the family!!



Please let me know if you would like to accept or decline this invitation for Wednesday, August 23rd
for the MAPTS Open House at Donlin Creek. The invitation was also extended to the Governor, but
her calendar already has events scheduled for that date.



Thanks!

Erika
