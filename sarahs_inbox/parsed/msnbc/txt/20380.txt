              Search efforts have been re-energized today by better weather and new
              information that significantly narrows the search area to a particular section of
              the Mansfield Peninsula of Admiralty Island. There have been corroborating
              reports of a loud impact heard from this area Saturday evening. Also, detailed
              information from Brian and Brandon's flight instructor has helped imagine the
              decisions they likely would have made as they dealt with weather situations on
              the return from Young Lake. All this information points to a particular area to
              focus today's efforts.

              Helicopter crews are covering the area this afternoon, as well as ground crews
              from Juneau Mountain Rescue. The ground crews are being assisted by "sea
              dogs," specially trained for tracking human and fuel scents. There is also a
              Department of Fish and Game research vessel working the area with side scan
              sonar trying to locate anything underwater.

              Brian's son BJ has set up a website that collects news on the search efforts.
              The web address is: http: / /andrewsinak.wordpress.com/-

              I'll send out more information as it comes in...

              -Pat
