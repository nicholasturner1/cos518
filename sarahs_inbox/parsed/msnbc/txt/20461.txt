           Meeting teachers this morning for first day of school so I won't be in until 10.

              I'll talk to you about the decision on Frank's resignation letter; I'll need to speak
           with Talis about DoL ' s interviewing process and the Constitutionality of the separation of
           powers /due process, etc.

             See you when I get in.
