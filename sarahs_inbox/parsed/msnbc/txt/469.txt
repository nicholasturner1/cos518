    Subject: Construction at Mansion and Governors Office at Capital

  Governor and Todd: If we schedule window replacement at the Mansion and new ceiling/asbestos removal in the
  Juneau Governor's Office, it would be best to schedule the Palin Family out of Juneau for the month of July.
  Before we go forward with these dates, is that okay with you? There would still be some window replacement in
  June, but it would not prevent the Governor from staying at the Mansion (Library, Dining room, Ballroom, etc.).
