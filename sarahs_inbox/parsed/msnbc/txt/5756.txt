              I didn't know about it. You would think he would have to ask permission to use your name/pic on
              anything he's sending out. If you need me to follow up with the Party I will, but will wait incase
              somebody is already handling it.

              In other news, you might already know ... Katie Hurley beat Dallas Massie in the MEA race. Don
              and Sharon called me right afterwards...

              Happy birthday to my favorite 6 year old!!
