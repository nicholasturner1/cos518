           Hi K:
           It's sunny here - but we're knee-deep in budget cutting so can't enjoy the 70 -plus-degrees today - can't feel the sun on our
           shoulders inside the building:(

           Hope all is well there - I'm glad we didn't schedule much in the evenings this week be these are long days in the budget
           deliberations.

           Thanks Kari! I hope you have an enjoyable, mellow day.

           And there' s rumors that we may have the jet sold?! If so- Dan deserves a toast.
