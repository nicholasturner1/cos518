            We'll get on it today. The arbitrator's ruling on Class One SU employees is due today,
            just FYI.  We'll respond after we have a chance to review with Law.

            I'd like to do it tomorrow to get it out of the way. Again, not a big media splash, but a
            sit down with reporters who are interested so they can really grasp where we're going:
            con't evaluation of structure, MOU, won't fight the legislature on its efforts to study
            the move and decide on their pending legislation to move it back... Committment to sound
            oversight and publicly supported permitting process, Etc.



            This media discussion can coincide with our explanation of the state's on-line checkbook
            that can begin tomorrow. I'll get an update on that and ask Annette to be ready for that
            tomorrow too. Thanks

            We will be working on the details of habitat roll out today. Have not set a day for
            announcements .  Do you have any preferences ? We will make sure statements and day are
            coordinated with you and the 3rd floor. I just arrived in Anchorage. I will be flying to
            Juneau tonight.  God bless.  Tom
