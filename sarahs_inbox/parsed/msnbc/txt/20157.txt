              By email.

              Dear Speaker Harris:

              Thank you for your letter earlier today , congratulating TransCanada on receiving legislative approval of the AGIA
              license. TransCanada is pleased to have reached agreement with the State of Alaska under AGIA. We sincerely
              appreciate receiving affirmative ratification from both your House and the Senate , and we now look forward to
              working closely with potential shippers, regulatory authorities and the State of Alaska to make this pipeline a reality.

              In your letter you requested clarification regarding my comments in today's Globe and Mail . I offer the following
              background and clarification:

              1. TransCanada has earned certain rights as the State 's chosen party under AGIA. Of equal importance,
              TransCanada has made specific undertakings and assumed significant obligations to the State of Alaska. I am
              pleased to confirm that TransCanada is committed to fulfilling all its obligations under AGIA in a manner that
              satisfies the State of Alaska.

              2. Attracting shippers is an essential element of any major pipeline project. As described in our AGIA application
              and in our responses to the legislature , TransCanada intends to vigorously pursue commercial negotiations with the
              Prudhoe Bay producers to secure their commitments as shippers . There are no more logical shippers for this project
              than the Prudhoe Bay producers.

              3. It is TransCanada's clear intention to reach commercial agreement with the three Prudhoe Bay producers,
              together with other shippers that may materialize as a result of the open season process . That is the best way for this
              project to proceed in a speedy and secure manner.

              4. It is a common phrase in the energy sector that "nothing goes ahead until Exxon is happy" . My wry observation
              along those lines was not meant as a negative comment on ExxonMobil , nor was it meant to imply that ExxonMobil
              has any sort of veto on the building of an Alaska gas pipeline . In fact, the reporter and I were discussing the
              importance of developing commercial arrangements that satisfy all parties , and I observed that its often a challenge
              to meet all the expectations of all parties.

               5. Clearly, neither ExxonMobil nor any other party has a veto over the manner in which the State of Alaska deals with its oil
               and gas assets.

               6. Nonetheless, I do believe a sound commercial arrangement including the Prudhoe Bay producers as shippers is the most
               logical way to bring this pipeline project forward.

               7. TransCanada is aware that the State of Alaska is pursuing resolution of various upstream matters . Those matters are not
               TransCanada's business, and TransCanada will not be a party to or take a position on any upstream matters.

               Speaker Harris, I trust the foregoing clarifications adequately address the concerns raised in your letter of earlier today.
               Should you require further clarification of TransCanada's position or intentions please contact either Tony Palmer or myself.

               Sincerely,

               Hal Kvisle, CEO
