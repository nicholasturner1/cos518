            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin and family,



            I just read a story in the Boston Pilot Catholic newspaper about the birth of you new son.

            My daughter, Martha, was born 28 years ago with Down syndrome. She has done very well.
            You are probably frightened by what the future will bring for you and your son. There is
            no need to be overly nervous. Things will work out for you and your family. Down
            syndrome is probably the most studied aspect of special education.

            The idea that Down syndrome children bring joy is really true. Make sure he is included
            with everything that the rest of your kids do.

            I respect the choice that you and your husband have made . I know from experience that you
            will be pleasantly rewarded and surprised (in the good sense ) by the choice you have made.

            Sincerely,

            Joe Nolan
