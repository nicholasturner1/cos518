           Thanks - I did just receive emails on the claim Walt is making. I will have to go back
           into the office as we had two different sets of calendars that were used and would not
           have them on my laptop. Also, would like to have Tibbles calendar back to go through for
           these meetings also. I don't know if those folks are available tonight. Janice

              Rosanne,

              Please incorporate these changes in the last few emails to Randy's statement. We need to get this wrapped up and to
     i        Meg asap. Not sure what is going on w/email, but I've cc'd Bill's personal email.

              Please send us revised draft before it goes to Meg.
              Kris

              Walt is not being truthful, again, if he told reporters this.
