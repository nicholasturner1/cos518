            Apparently this is done through Public Safety.

          I am in the process of updating next year's 32nd Edition of The Alaska Almanac. One
          segment of the Almanac deals with Alaska ' s Medal of Heroism.



          Can you please tell me if there have been any Medal of Heroism awarded more recently than
          the one given to Keira Lestina in 2003? If so, could you have someone send me the name of
          the recipient, a brief description of the circumstance resulting in the award, and the
          year it was given?



           Thank you very much for your help.
