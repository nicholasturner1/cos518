              Subject: Meeting with Governor. Sheffield




              I spoke to Governor Sheffield a few minutes ago. He would                like to meet with the Governor
              next week (Wednesday preferably) for 30 minutes to discuss              gasline and some thoughts he
              has.  He said this is more of a friend to friend, personal              conversation and suggested that
              it be a small group consisting of myself and Nizich. From               what I gathered, he has some
              messaging/packaging ideas on AGIA, working with producers,              etc.
