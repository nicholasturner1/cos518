              Dear Mr. and Mrs. Arnold - As you know, Governor Palin vetoed a $300,000 request for the Sterling Community
              Club, Inc., Sterling Community Center, in the FY08 capital budget. I have looked at the projects included in the
              bill, SB256, currently pending action in the State House of Representatives, and do not find that this project is
              included, either at $300,000 or $100,000. I recall our conversation last summer and appreciate your feedback.
               The bill is currently schedule to be heard on the House floor on Monday. Karen

             Dear Karen,

              Last year we were able to stop $ 100K with regard to the Sterling Community
             (Contractors) Club including a telephone call we made to you personally. We
             hope this item did not make the "supplemental budget" that the Legislature is
             fighting Sarah over. The property is full of benzene from the "Zip Mart" fuel spill
             estimated at 100K gallons. Benzene causes cancer! All it takes is a strong
             enough "spring ice heave" that breaks the black clay barrier, then the Benzene is
             on top of the ground for the children to play in. This is the kind of "nitro glycerin"
             that is at stake here! Does the State want to deal with this type of potential
             threat?

             The Community Club is made up and run by several local contractors. Those folk
             do not represent the views of the "majority" in Sterling. "Amazing Grace" Merkes
             has been down there on the borough dime recently probably pushing Head Start
             on the condemned property. Some how Gracie was able to con the Denali
             Commission to give the Sterling Community Contractors Club $ 1 million to draw
             up building plans for the condemned site. Uncle Ted probably "ear marked" it!
             Who knows, because everything is done in secret. Too many "Secret Agents" in

              all forms of government!

              Grace and her crew held a meeting at the Seniors Center a few months ago with
              Tim Navarre moderating, a quiet meeting (little notification) and 26 showed up;
              20 representing the contractors club and Grace's relatives that make up her
              Head Start. This whole thing stinks to high heaven! In the past years when the
              whole community voted, Gracie and her relatives and friends lost "big time." All
              the funding Amazing Grace goes after for Sterling is done in a manner secretly,
              even the process she uses on the borough assembly. You call the borough and
              no one knows about anything about proposed funding for Sterling that most of us
              are against.

              If the $ 100 K is in the supplemental, please see Sarah and squash it! We would
              appreciate hearing from you or Sarah about this.
