              I don't know if my earlier email this week was received on this: the mtg today with a
              baseball coach(?). is it still on? Who asked for the mtg, what do they want? Any idea what
              the "ask" is for state govt to help with baseball?



              The guy listed on the mtg doesn't sound familiar, so not sure why it's scheduled.
