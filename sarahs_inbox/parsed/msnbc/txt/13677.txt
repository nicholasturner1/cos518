              Governor:

              AMHS

              I wanted to report that we are getting very good feedback on the appointment of Jim Beedle to the deputy
              commissioner position for AMHS. Even Senator Elton had some positive comments.

              MEETING WITH IDITAROD COMMITTEE

              I believe Leo and Christine are going to meet with the Iditarod Committee next week . They want to let the
              Committee know that the FAA still objects to the use of the airport for the event and continues to threaten DOT
              with sanctions . I think Leo and Christine want to offer the following to the Iditarod Committee as a short term 3-5
              year solution.
