               Subject: education

            I would like to talk to have a more serious conversation with legislators this weekend about education funding.
            We do have a new proposal that does not reduce the BSA . At this point, we have not passed out numbers to
            anyone until we have a chance to walk you through the proposal and get your OK . We have a great opportunity
            to introduce a bill that addresses the local school district ' s needs and gives them certainty and sign the
            supplemental bill with the $1 Billion savings for education early next week.

             Do you have any time to talk about education before you leave tomorrow?

             Mike
