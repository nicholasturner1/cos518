            Dear Governor Palin,




            Dear Governor Palin -




            I'm writing to thank you for your efforts to increase funding

             for pre-kindergarten education this year. As you clearly know,
                                                                   1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0016706

            providing high-quality pre-k benefits our children and increases

            their chances of future success . Supporting state-funded pre-k -

            even in lean budget times - is a commitment to our children and

            an investment in our economic prosperity , and we cannot afford

            to pass up these opportunities.



            Thank you again for your leadership on this important issue. I

            hope I can continue to count on your support for pre-k in the

            future. Our children's future demands nothing less. Positive

            learning experiences early in life will encourage children to

            stay in school longer and make their future bright. You have

            made a difference.



            Sincerely, Maira R. Hartz Child/Adult Care Specialist
