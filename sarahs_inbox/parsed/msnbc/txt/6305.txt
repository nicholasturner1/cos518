         we would love to have you open our year with a presentation that talks about your grass
         root marketing efforts in your election to become our next Govenor! The luncheon is
         scheduled for Thursday, September 13th at the Anchorage Hilton from 11:30 - lpm with the
         speaker beginning at approximately 12:15 until 12:45.   We would love to have you as your
         marketing efforts were very ethical and admirable. Please let me know if this date would
         work or if you might be available for future dates.



         Sincerely



        Deborah Rinckey
