          Governor - We just got word that the AK Airlines Flight just landed and the Goldstreak
          should be in town by 6:00 p.m. Is this a good time for you for Lauren to come over to the
          House to have it signed or do you want it brought over at another time if your out for
          dinner -



           P.S. - Don't burn Trig... the lucky duck - Janice
