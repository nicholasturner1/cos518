           Fyi- We may have a small AGIA reception at house, depending on AGIA team's schedule.

           Also, don't know when/what instruction changed recently where now there has to be a First
           Family-invited event to justify any family member traveling with me TO Juneau (I was
           always told it was reversed... that family could only travel OUT of Juneau if there was a
           First Family event to attend), but now that the rule has evidently changed please rsvp for
           any First Family event this week so Piper and Trig may travel with me back to Juneau
           today... and I'll see ya in a few hours at the capitol. Thanks!
