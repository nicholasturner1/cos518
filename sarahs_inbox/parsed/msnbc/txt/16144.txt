                Subject: Wall Street Journal tomorrow

              Governor-

              Jim Carleton from the Wall Street Journal will be interviewing you tomorrow . He is doing a feature
              about you - not focusing on one particular issue. He will be attending the bill signings , tomorrow
              and the one in Kenai. While this is more of a feature, I have attached the latest talking points from
              Meg on oil and gas issues. Thanks
