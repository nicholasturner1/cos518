             Thanks so much Stacie. We'll chop the reference to Privileged rom the op-ed so we don't
             spend too many of our allotted 675 words explaining them all. Thanks much!

            There are seven current lawsuits and one administrative appeal (listed below):



            1.   Fuhs v. Gilberston (Supreme Court)

            2. Alaska Open Imaging v. Jackson (Supreme Court)

            3. Dr. Bridges v. Jackson (superior court)

            4. Dr. Bridges v. Jackson (admin appeal)

            5. Mat-Su Valley v. Advanced Medical Centers (superior court)

            6. Advanced Medical Centers v. Kobuk Ventures, Fairbanks Memorial and DHSS (superior
            court)

            7. Fairbanks Memorial v. Advanced Medical Centers, Kobuk and DHSS (superior court)

            8.   South Anchorage Ambulatory Surgery Center v. DHSS (superior court)



            There was one other appeal between Imaging Associates of Providence and DHSS, but the
            administrative law judge said Imaging Associates was not a physicians' office therefore
            they needed a CON. Imaging Associates did not appeal, and filed a CON in January of this
            year.  The Kelly bill would resolve this issue in favor of Imaging Associates (as well as
            items 2, 3, and 4 on the above list).

             More information than you probably wanted, but I was not sure what everyone was looking
             for vis - A-vis the status of the litigation. I can provide more if necessary.

            Are there eight or nine CON lawsuits pending that involve the state and private sector?
