             up the good work. The people of Alaska are very fortunate to have you taking care of their
             intrests and your newborn son is also very fortunate to have the parents he has. Best
             wishes and God bless you all.

             Dear Governor Palin,




            I read the article about your new son Trig , and it is a very touching story. Your
            positivity is refreshing . You seem very wholesome , on the ball and positive . It would be
            great to see you run for president someday.
