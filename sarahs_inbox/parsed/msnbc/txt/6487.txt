        Pls keep in touch with Sharon on this b / c I do anticipate the afternoon talk shows will
        run with it - as the morning show made it a very negative issue for us. Do you want
        someone on the Fagan and

        / or Pocorro and other shows today ? Pls let Sharon know...

       In today ' s cabinet meeting the Governor asked that we make sure we have people involved
       and we stay ahead of the AGIA deadline extension discussion .    We need to be involved where
       necessary with talk shows, media , business etc so Alaskans can understand where we are
        (positive interest ) versus the nay sayers . We are hearing no applicants and we are
       listening to complaints that we don ' t know where they are even coming from .  Marty, since
       you are traveling would you call and lets discuss as soon as possible .    Thanks Tom

                            August 9, 2007


                            The Honorable Sarah Patin
                            Governor of Alaska
                            Office of the Governor
                            Juneau, Alaska

                            Dear Governor Patin:

                            As presiding officer for the Alaska House of Representatives , I have conducted a poll
                            among all representatives in response to your August 3'd announcement regarding a
                            special session on Petroleum Profits Tax (PPI). Our understanding is that you intend to
                            issue a proclamation on September 4, 2007, to call the legislature into special session on
                            October 18, 2007. You also requested help from legislators on their preference regarding
                            where the special session should be located, and that was the subject of our poll.

                            All forty representatives were given the opportunity to express their thoughts, and there
                            are differing opinions among members. Some feel that Juneau has the technical
                            infrastructure in place to conduct floor sessions on a complex piece of legislation; others
                            feel that Anchorage is more personally accessible for a greater number of Alaskans; and
                            there are members who question whether a special session is even necessary or advisable
                            at this time.

                            While Juneau received more votes than other locations, there is also a consensus among
                            many House members that you, as the governor, are responsible for determining both the
                            location and the subject matter to be discussed.

                            Many members referenced state law that requires whichever entity that calls for a special
                            session - whether it's the governor or the legislature - to be the same entity that
                            determines the location (AS 24.05.100). However, Juneau Representative Beth Kerttula
                            and two other members from the House Minority Caucus have raised a question over
                            whether any governor has the constitutional authority to determine the location of a
                            special session under the doctrine of separation of powers.

                            We look forward to working with you and your administration toward conducting a
                            special session that assesses whether the state is getting its fair share of oil and gas
                            revenues, and whether the credits are optimally designed to provide the maximum

                     the best approach is to hear from you regarding what issues will be specifically
                     addressed, and where you would like to see the session located.
