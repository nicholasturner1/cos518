          Pls submit to all publications, not just ADN. Was a spot requested and reserved with
          Zencey at ADN? And if there's the fear that the op-ed is not timely any more so may not be
          accepted to run, then it's all the more reason why it should have been written a week ago
          as I had assumed it would be. (Even during the veto exercise it could have been crafted...
          certainly it could have been written immediatley after wrapping up the budget.). The last
          two days of tweaking this was necessary because the first draft I saw of it did not arrive
          on my desk until I had to request it, and then it was certainly not a final product -
          there was a lot of tweaking that had to be done before the product was to be released to
          Alaskans. Hopefully we'll soon be able to be more proactive and "out front" on important
          messages that Alaskans need to hear. Thanks

          Governor, this is the final that all 10 of us have finally agreed to.

          Randy and Karen had substantive edits, which were very helpful. Many

          others have weighed in as well. The main concern has been                Privileged or

           Privileged or Personlrhere was also a LOT of tweaking that has gone on over

           the course of two days -- tweaking numbers, tweaking the exact wording

           of everything. My concern is that it has taken so long for this piece to

           be written by a committee that Matt won't even run it now because it is

           too old and stale. Let's hope he will still run it. Once you approve, I

           will give this to Sharon to send to him. Here it is:
