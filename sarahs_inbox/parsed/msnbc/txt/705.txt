 I can call him, but... Todd do you remember talking to him or do you know what this is about?

 Subject : Phone Call requesting time w/Governor

 Kris - I gave this phone message to the Governor and she wanted to check to see if you knew this person. She
 does not know the name.

 Chris Hunter - called on 10.23.07 - Mr. Hunter asked to have the Governor return his phone call. He says he is a
 good friend and has called the house but the Governor is never there. He said he spoke with Todd and Todd
 asked that he call Janice in the Juneau office to get an appointment. Mr. Hunter will not state why he wants to
 meet with his good friend. Only that he has been trying to get in touch. Apparently he owns his own business but
 would not state what it was.
