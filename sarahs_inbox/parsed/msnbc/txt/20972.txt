      Sept. 30th, 2007rnrnDear Governor Palin,rnGood news! I just received an email from William
      in Hooper Bay about Piercy in Chefornak! His Yup'ik humor mask on Conan O'Brien is being
      auctioned on eBay and is up to $15,669.00. KTUU has a story on this on it's web site. This
      is very big! It is the cream of the local grassroots using eBay for maximum empowerment!
      rnrnFor four years I have been giving workshops commercially empowering people in rural
      villages to not just earn on eBay, but to earn more! I would very much like to tell you
      about these workshops. Currently there is no funding for any more and we are just reaching
      the tipping point. I encourage you to take a deeper look at this grass roots movement and
      empowerment. I am eager to show you just a few slides, discuss the 20+ villages I have
      given workshops in recently, and the 46 villages I work with for just this.rnrnPlease, 20
      minutes is all I ask. rnrnThank you,rnJoseph Davisrnwatermark@acsalaska.netrn907.250.5561
