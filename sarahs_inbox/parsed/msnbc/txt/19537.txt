                 Subject: Concern over potential illegal actions by ADF&G
                Your prompt review of the attached letter would be appreciated. It is my concern that ADF&G continues
                to conduct itself in a manner that is potentially illegal under State law. I believe a full and open review of
                these matters by the Attorney General office may be necessary to resolve them.

                If the actions were in fact illegal then the administration in keeping with an open and transparent policy
                should acknowledge that fact.
