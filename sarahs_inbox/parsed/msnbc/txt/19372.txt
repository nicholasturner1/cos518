          Yes. I have everyone ck'd in and your boarding passes. I'll get your luggage, get it
          checked. They'll escort you thru down below. I will go thru up her after everything is
          ck'd and will see you on other side. .

          At arrival, 7pm, go to the upper ramp (departures) to United. You'll be greeted there by
          airport personnel (and me) to take luggage.



           From there go back around to airport again to the bottom ramp/baggage claim area to
          United. Airport security will meet you there and escort you all thru security. They'll
          park car.
