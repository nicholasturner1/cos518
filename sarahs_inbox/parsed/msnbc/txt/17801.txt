         Erika - would have the Govs Mansion's alcohol that's in the liquor cabinet boxed up and
         removed from "the People' s House " downstairs in the public dining area?  Here's my
         thinking: with so many kids and teens coming and going in that house, esp during this
         season of celebrationstt for young people - proms, graduations, etc, I want to send the
         msg that we can be - and "the People' s House" needs to be - alcohol-free. There's a lot of
         booze there - its too accessible and may be too tempting to any number of all those teens
         coming and going.



         We need to send this sobriety msg. It can be sent via support from Native Sobriety Assns,
         M. A. D. D. , Healthcare Strategies Council, or whomever can also benefit from the vocal
         support that I can provide them through this action, then I'll do it.

                    kari - fyi interview for record/schedule. also - security just called me on their
          way to pick me up for flight to skagway - now the problem is the King Air has a flat tire
          so can't fly afterall. My family is all on the ferry - so they'll have to conduct the
          niceities without me this evening in Skagway and I'll still try to get there somehow
          tomorrow.   what a continued zoo this is, trying to get from point A to.point B - and i
          don't know why the flat tire wasn't discovered until a just now.



                     erika and ivy - I may be here afterall tonight.
