         Coordinating w Molly is great - here's her email. The DOA reception can double up on food
         so we can have leftovers for footballers. Todd doesnt want them hanging too much upstairs,
         but we'll show 'em where we live and they can hang on that main floor and game rm
         downstairs.



         It was great to see u guys!

        Hello Governor,



        If you're up to having the Colony team over after the game-

       We could order pizzas and make some brownies, plus use up the left overs from the DOA
                                                            1




                                                                                                        PRA GSP01_0004630

         reception . We have 3 boxes of brownie mix and Diane said she could make them Thursday, so
         they're ready to go . She really loves to bake and do that kind of stuff!



         Just let me know what you and Molly decide - and we'll make sure it happens! :) If you
         want, I could just coordinate this with Molly.



         Thanks for having us over for dinner , we really enjoyed spending time with you and your
         family! Your parent's home is definitely an Alaskan treasure !!!   It was fun seeing the
         kids in their own stomping grounds. :)

         Erika
