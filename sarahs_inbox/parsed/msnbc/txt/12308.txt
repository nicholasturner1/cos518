                Solicitor General of the United States
                Office of the Solicitor General
                950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
                Washington, DC 20530-0001


                February        20, 2008


                Dear Solicitor General Clement:


                On behalf of First Things First, Inc., I urge you to file a petition for writ of certiorari in the case
                of SEACC et al. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers et al, Case No. 06-35679 (9th Circuit, May 22,
                2007) asking that the Supreme Court review the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court.

               Most of us have carefully followed the historic Kensington Gold Mine, from concept through
               construction and maintain that the agencies were correct in issuing these permits . Further, we
               believe the Ninth Circuit Court has made an erroneous reading of the Clean Water Act in this
               case. If the decision of the Ninth Circuit stands, the negative impact on mining could make
               permitting any project in Alaska, practicably impossible.

                We also believe the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court vacating Goldbelt's 404 permit is a gross
                injustice to the intent of Congress when it enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
                providing these lands to Goldbelt with the intent that they be used for economic development
                and betterment of Goldbelt' s stockholders . It is egregious that SEACC, Lynn Canal
                Conservation and the Sierra Club are using this lawsuit to block Goldbelt's ability to develop its

               land in an environmentally responsible manner.

               The Kensington is vital to sustaining the economy of this region and reversing the decline in population
               and living standards that Southeast Alaska has been experiencing. To us, the anticipated 200 year-
               round, well paying jobs and the infusion of $16 million per year in payroll is a golden opportunity.

               Once again, please join in seeking the Supreme Court's review of the Ninth Circuit's erroneous
               decision.

               Sincerely,
