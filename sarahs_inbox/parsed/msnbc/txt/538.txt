  Subject : June 26 Cathi Geerin hockey fundraiser
  Hi Todd. Here is the information about the fundraiser on June 26 that Cathi Geerin is calling about. The
  Governor noted on the request, "check with Todd about this." The event is at 6-9pm at the Anchorage
  Sheraton on June 26, dinner and silent auction. They want to auction off a lunch with the Governor
  (which we are trying NOT to do, since it's so hard to fulfill). They want Governor and First Gentleman to
  sit at head table, but nothing in the request asks for the Governor to speak. (As we all know, it seems like
  if she's there, they want a speech tho!).

  The Governor's schedule for June 26 in Anchorage is as follows:
  10:00am Cabinet Meeting
  12:30pm Meet with BG Group in Anch Gov's Office
  1:00-5:00pm Budget work in Anch Gov's Office

  The Governor's schedule for June 27 in Anchorage is as follows:
  Do Not Schedule all day-work on budget bills
  7:00pm-9:00pm Attend Scotty Gomez fundraiser at Anch Sheraton with Track
