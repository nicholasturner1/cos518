          Hi Governor Palin,



          First, I would like to congratulate you and your family on the birth of

          your son.     Bobby has truly been a joy to our family and such a blessing.



          Bobby and I wish nothing but the best for you and your family and

          especially for your new son.




          Take care,




           //SIGNED//
