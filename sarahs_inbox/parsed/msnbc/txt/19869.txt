           Kopp told us yesterday that no one has asked for the letter of reprimand that we did not
           know existed, thus no one in Admin (including me) has seen it.

             I do want to see it, he said he should be able to get Kenai to let me see it (well, I
           would think so!), so please ask again for it today.

             Also, I was shocked to see the dispatcher (former) sent me an email nearly two weeks
          ago and yet I was never given her message . In addition, all the other emails pertaining to
          the sexual harassment allegation that I had to ask for yesterday and they are now being
          compiled for me... it should be easy to figure out that these communications surrounding
          such a volitile issue should have been given to me without me having to hustle around
          trying to find out where they landed and to ask why they were not forwarded to me. Again,
          that email/communication system has got to change so I am not the last to know.

             Talis- let's talk again today in my office, I do a presser at 9:30, then Julie kitka
          (no subject known) at 11am. Then when you get a chance can you come over or I'll go to
          you. Please get Kopp's letter, and I'll speak with you more re: his APSC file that an ADN
          reporter asked him about yesterday.
