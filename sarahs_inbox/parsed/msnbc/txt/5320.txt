              Kari,

              Hope all is going well.            I'd like to set up a brief appointment with

              Governor sometime in the next 2 weeks if you could squeeze in 10 minutes

              anytime.          It's regarding serving on her team and of a personal nature.

              I will be in and out of Juneau for legislative work and meetings off and

              on so am flexible. Once I know a time that may work I'll arrange my

              schedule to match up.

              Thanks much and have a great week!
