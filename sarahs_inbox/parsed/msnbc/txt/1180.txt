MESSAGE:

Congratulations of the birth of your baby!!

My youngest daughter is 4 and happens to have Down syndrome. She along with our other children
is the joy of our lives. Having Elise has been so wonderful and so meaningful that I can't put it into
words. There have been days that I cried tears of sadness but many more tears of happiness.
Thank you for having your child. You can use your position to help others with Down syndrome be
born and live an included and active life. I have never been to your state but someday I would like to
visit. All of the best and God bless!!!
