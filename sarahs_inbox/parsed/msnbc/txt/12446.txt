               I'll convey to Dillon the four messages contained in your two emails. Sounds like
               you did some good missionary work on all issues.

               Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
               jwkatO ,,alaskadc.org. Thank you.

                   Chuck, per your request, I will distribute your letter to Congressman Dingell to
                   the appropriate State people. Thanks for letting us know.

                   Dear Governor:
                   I missed meeting with you during your visit last November.
                   Hope you may squeeze me into your schedule this week.
                   I regret the embarrassment that may emanate for your
                   Administration by Commissioner Irwin's improperly
                   researched letter to Chairmen Dingell and Rahall.

                   Another Congressional release on BP gross negligence in Prudhoe
                   operations soon will identify gross, 'inept', oversight by regulators
                   ADNR, PSIO, AKOSH, and the Fire Marshall.

                   If you don't halt Reconfiguration of Pump Station #3 promptly
                   90 % of Alaska' s annual revenue may be in peril. You publicly
                   stated that NO PUMP #3 CONSTRUCTION WOULD PROCEED
                   ON YOUR STATE LAND until Pump #9 is operating properly and
                   safely. Pump #9 has serious 'identified ' problems which ould cause
                   disruption of the oil flow through the TAPS this winter.

                   As I told you on the phone last year, I have a plan for your
                   oversight (along with the BP shareholders) to protect your
                   interests (beyond your regulators ) without any expense for
                   the State.

               Apparently the National Press Club does not allow for one on one interviews. NBC would like to
               know if they can interview you back at the Marriott at noon.
