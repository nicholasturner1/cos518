         I think we can keep it short. I will double check in the morning to make sure Joe's
         spreadsheets are done.   rivilPnPrl nr PPrcnnal Material RPdartari
                                                 I am just not sure if he has been able to find a lower
         cost and I'll feel pretty bad if we cancel on Joe S tomorrow if he needs the weekend to
         prepare for Sept 5 budget mtg, hense he's seeking direction from us tomorrow. Mtg with him
         and Russ is fine with me, we'll just make sure they can keep it concise?
