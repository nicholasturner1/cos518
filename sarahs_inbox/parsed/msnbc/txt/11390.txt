             Sched says I'm speaking on statewide economic forecast tomorrow at noon to a group - is
             anyone working on that? Would the Anchorage office know of what the group is anticipating
             hearing ? I believe folks from our office - or other areas of state govt - have already
             spoken on the issue to different World Trade forums. We need coordinated msg and don't
             need to reinvent the wheel.



             Also, Saturday's NEA speech I need to get sooner rather than later because they're a very
             tough crowd.
