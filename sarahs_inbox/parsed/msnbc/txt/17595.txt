             Subject: GUEST LIST QUESTION- Friends of the Governor 's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser , May 9th,
                      2007 at the Residence

           Hello Governor and Mr. Palin,

           The list of lobbyists for the Friends of the Governor 's Mansion Foundation Fundraiser are listed below for your
           review/approval. I've also attached the 2007 Lobbyist Directory in case you wanted the client/employer
           information. Please let me know if you' d like to make any changes or have any additional guests that you'd like to
           include.

           F.Y.I. - The Foundation pays for the food, beverage, and staff over time expenses , so that it's not an expense that
           the House incurs. I have a copy of a memorandum from the Department of Law from March 14, 2005 where the
           question was asked if there would be any Executive Ethics Act (AS 39 .52) or other legal concerns
           presented if the foundation held a fundraiser at the Governor 's Mansion and the conclusion (was that the
           First Lady (Gentleman In this case ) is not a "public official " under the Ethics Act, the strictures of the Act
           do not apply to herlhim. The Governor may also host fundraising activities at the residence , and he may
           freely invite guests and host functions as he/she deems proper. Of course, there is much more information,
           and this is paraphrased, but I wanted you to be aware of some of the issues that have been addressed. I could
           fax a copy to you if you'd like.

           If at all possible, it would be great to have the final guest list as soon as possible, as May 9th is quickly
           approaching.

           Thank you,
           Erika
