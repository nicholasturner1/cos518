              Dear Governor Palin;




              I recently read in the newspaper, concerning your wonderment about how to use the states
              Billions of available funds. It is appropriate to suggest that you build UAA a new
              Athletic Facility. Thank you for welcoming all comments, concerns, ideas, and questions.



              Sincerely.
