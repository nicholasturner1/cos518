            I had some mail bounce back and wanted to make sure you'd received this information about
            the Hoover question and answer.

             Usual remarks are scheduled for about 45 minutes -- about half that time for a
             speech/remarks and the other half for question and answer from the participants (the
             Hoover Overseers list is in your binder).



             You are on the agenda right after the luncheon break. So if you would rather NOT do a
             question and answer session, Noel can adjust the time to have you begin a bit later.

             Sounds fine, i suppose, but what does that entail in this forum? How long? Ive not heard
             of the group so its a guess.

             Do you want to participate in a Q&A after your remarks?

             It IS optional and up to you.

             That speech is very good. I'm happy to deliver it to the Hoover group if they still have
             space on the agenda. Thanks
