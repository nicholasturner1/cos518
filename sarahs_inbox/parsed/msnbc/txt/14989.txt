              Lyda called this morning . She is back from Texas and would like to follow -up w/you on your last conversation re:
              Special Session . She said she has a plan that she wants to run by you . Also, she stated that she has heard that
              some entities (didn't state who , but I'm guessing AK Family Council - Jim Minnery' s group) will be campaigning to
              get the bills heard during special session and she would like to divert that.

              I told her that I would relay the message but due to your schedule.        sure how soon you would be able to
              contact her. She left the following numbers : cell Privileg , hm Privilege
