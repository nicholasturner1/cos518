               Subject: Congressman Boehner/SpeakerPelosi


              Russ Kelly and I have made several calls to Capitol Hill, including to the offices of Speaker Pelosi and Minority
              Leader Boehner. The Democrat's energy legislation is not yet available. It may be tomorrow or early next
              week. The bill itself will probably not be Introduced until Wednesday.

              So, my earlier critique will have to suffice for the moment. Mr. Boehner 's staff analyzes the announced
              components pretty much as I have - a public relations exercise but not much substance.

              Mr. Boehner is leading a small entourage of House Republicans to ANWR in the same timeframe as the so-called
              Republican Challengers trip. Arctic Power is concerned about possible overlap, not something any of us can
              control.

              Mr. Boehner has not discussed the trip publicly, but I'm trying to get more information from his staff. I think it
              would be good if we can get you and him together, assuming your schedule permits.
