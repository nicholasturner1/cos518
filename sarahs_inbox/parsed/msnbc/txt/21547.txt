              Don't forget that she has recently filed to run for re-election. That

               could explain the difference between her willingness to get involved in

              the issue now versus her stubbornness last summer.

              Lyda just told me she's called for an extensive audit of MatMaid be she

              said she's received a lot of information concerning improprieties and

                                                                    1

              "problems at MatMaid ",    including " conflicts of interest with people

              serving ". I told her " no kidding there ' s been problems , that ' s why we

              have a dedicated team of volunteers trying to get information on what

              went wrong and then how to right MatMaid ". I also asked her if she's

              seeking to get information on problems we inherited , or did she feel we

              caused MatMaid ' s problems ? She said ,     " it's both".



              What ' s frustrating is Kristan and Kris and others have begged for

              assistance to get our own audit of MatMaid , they ' ve basically had to do

              it themselves , and now it sounds like a legislator who doesn't

              necessarily want to see us succeed is moving forward on her own intense

              audit . We've had push back on our own request , which is understandably

              quite frustrating for BAC members who've cared sincerely about MatMaid

              and have wanted and needed information on MatMaid operations since Day

              One.   I asked Lyda why don ' t we work on this together ,       if truly now she

              wants to help on MatMaid , but her goals are evidently not our goals - as

              we're not blaming this admin nor this BAC for the problems at MatMaid.



              So, head's up.



              And I still want Kristan's request to be granted re: an audit if that's

              what Kristan needs.
