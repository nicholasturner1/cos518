          Governor,



          Jerry Burnett testified last night that Revenue could issue PFD checks with the rebate
          early. Also, the House has the full 1200 dollars in their bill and will review the Senate
          version today.  Hopefully they will amend that with the 1200 as well.



          Kelly

          House needs to bump the rebate way above the Senate's version. And I need assurance
          Revenue can get the checks out attached to PFDs early... fuel barges take orders earlier
          than the October PFD disbursement. The public does not know that our intention is to get
          surplus $ into Alaskans' hands before October. Pls let leggies and the public know that.
