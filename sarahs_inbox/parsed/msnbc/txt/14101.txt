           Erika- there won't be a need to purchase more food between now and end of session - fruit
           for Piper (at the most, no need to buy any more food besides that). There's still a lot
           here we need to eat up so it doesn't go to waste. Also, if food can be consolidated
           downstairs in all those freezers we could unplug most of them and save electricity. Thanks
