            Track told me: "I'm the army's now, so it could be illegal if you talk about my orders."
            :)  He's trying anything to keep me from shining any spotlight on him - I just can't blame
            him either.

           I jsut talked to track- he said this may tick off his leaders so really dreads it and asks
           that I not- says he will be treated differently if anyone makes a deal out of it and does
           not want any special treatment. I can't blame him

           I'll talk to them since I just got another comment re: questioning my support of him being
           in military (ie. perception that I haven't wanted to talk about it be I may not be
           supportive? Geeez ). I'll talk to them, put it to rest and show support for all military!
