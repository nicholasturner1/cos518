Subject: Bullets for the Governor for Tuesday' s meetings with the companies
Governor Palin, Lt. Governor Parnell, Mike,
I thought it might be useful to provide some brief background information on the companies we
are meeting this week. I am attaching bullets for Tuesday's meetings and I'll send out the
Wednesday bullets tomorrow around noon. The bullets are segregated by company and include
a couple of questions the Governor may like to ask them. These questions are not highly
charged, but the answers may prove helpful.

Governor Palin,
Here are some bullets that might be useful in your discussion with the press following your first
day of meetings with the corporations & organizations with an interest in the gas pipeline
project.
