  Here is the info on Great Bear Ford and Bob Favretto. If you need anymore info --- please call. Thank
  you. Paula




  Here is a summary of the case:

  The Wage and Hour Section currently has 16 claims filed against Great Bear Ford, LLC for a total amount
  in unpaid wages of $33,978.57. The Investigator (Kim Aure) has been in contact with the company's
  attorney (Greg Oczkus) since the first wage claim was filed on March 28, 2007. On May 31, Mr. Oczkus
  communicated that the company was $5 million in debt and there would not be enough assets to pay
  the wage claims. Mr. Oczkus has not yet provided a written response, so a subpoena may become
  necessary. Investigator Aure is currently collecting evidence to determine whether the owner, Robert
  Favretto, may be individually liable for the wages due employees of the company.

  Let me know if you need more information.

  Grey Mitchell
  Director, Labor Standards and Safety
