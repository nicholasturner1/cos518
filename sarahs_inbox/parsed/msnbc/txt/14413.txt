            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

            Although I am not a resident of Alaska, I felt compelled to write you after I read your
            statemnents regarding your newborn son in an article from the Family Research Council. I
            admire your courage in "going public" regarding your son's Down's Syndrome and want to
            share with you what a treasure these children are. I have a Down's cousin who is now 50
            years old. I have always been very close to him and his family and can tell you from
            experience that these children are the most loving people on this earth. I am sure you
            have heard this from other parents and relatives of Down's children. I wish you and your
            family well as you welcome this wonderful child and pray that you will all come to
            understand a saying that is close to my heart:

            "God created Down's children to teach the rest of us about love."

            Sincerely,

            Marjorie Sielinski
