         Thank you Governor - we "suspense" state card charges made while someone is in travel
         status and reconcile the charges when we process travel authorization close outs. I'll
         need Kris to email me with credit card charges that do not coincide with her travel.



         Hope you're having a good day!

         Linda

         Hi Linda:

         I used my credit card for coffee while in either the South Dakota or Minneapolis airport
         yest. It was my only use of the card - if you need this kind of info for records?



         Thanks,

         Sarah Palin

          Hi Kris,



          Your travel credit card has been "unrestricted". Please use that card

          for your purchasing needs.           As I mentioned on the phone this morning,

          please send an email when you use the card for purchases other than

          transportation or lodging.           We need to clear charges each day in the

          accounting system and need a purpose for the charge.



          Also, please remember to email me as soon as possible regarding any

          purchase    ( other than transportation / lodging that been prior approved via

          a TA)that exceeds $ 500.00 .         I will need to approve your purchases in

          some instances ,    and Shawn or Steve will need to get the appropriate

          state purchasing documents prepared and distributed.



          Thanks

          Linda

         I left you a voice message too.       I would like to understand the process

         of how this is done, can you tell me what the correct procedures are and

         what the timeline for getting it done is? Thank you!

         Sunny- would you work with Linda Perez to get Kris Perry a state credit

         card - Kris continues to have to purchase things without one and the

         sooner the better on this. Thanks so much!
