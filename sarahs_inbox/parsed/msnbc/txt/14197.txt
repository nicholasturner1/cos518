                Date: 4-9-08
                inreference to bill 152 on renewable energy,,,, i have not read it so my opologies..

                i did want to comment so i drafted these short notes for your committee to consider.
                 Please accept these for the record as my testimony in case i am unable to testify
                tomorrow .again...
                Thank You again.

               I hope some day you all can escape from your captivity in Juneau and return to your "homeland
               in the heart of Alaska area" where 85% + of your people eagerly await and hope for your
               wellbeing and prosperous return; so we can participate along side you all in a more rewarding
               and sharing attempt to help in the history of building a great country state like Alaska where our
               fathers and mothers came to be a more free people, an honest people, with a government by, for
               and of the people !

               I.realize I am unworthy of this attempt to remind you all of your absence from your obligation to
               your people; given your great lineages of contributions to Alaskas history...
               But it seems to me that most great societies failed without being connected to their citizens
               accountability .....I never saw a great battle or struggle fought between good and evil without the
               heroes being in the midst of the battle with their people...in the frey..

               Respectfully,

                  One only and lonely Alaskan citizen who misses being able to so readily give our great
               leaders a hard time because they are working so hard, so far, far away, in a really neat, pretty,
               warm, friendly,distant, unaccessable, remote, little tourist town with the .05% of the creme de la
               creme aristocracy; While i SLOG back and forth, to and fro from my humble abode to the LIO
               only to no avail, again and again the ability to humbely contribute to my community of the Great
               State of Alaska and Our Great Leaders quest to fmd justice and better society for us all....
