             Subject:                 Press


             It's been suggested by media that I have regular press availabilities - not so much formal
             press confs , but more casual availability. I'm game for that. I'd think gasline and budget
             will be brightest on radar screens next week , so let' s plan on inviting those two topics
             for discussion - meaning I 'd like AGIA and budget folks to join me in the discussions.



             Sharon and Beth can set up - ideally early in week when AGIA team arrives in Juneau.



             Let's anticipate other topics and have appropriate personnel available to help cover
             issues that the press wants to share with Alaskans during these press functions. Thank
             you!
