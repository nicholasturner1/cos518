             Mixed bag today out of this industry event in anchorage. Bad news: BP is going to stop
             work by two drill rigs that perform well workovers. I haven't heard the stated reason
             yet, but it likely has something to do with fallout from the standard deduction since well
             workovers are operating expenses. If that is the case, the production isn't lost but only
             deferred.  After the standard deduction sunsets in 2009, they can go in and perform those
             workovers all the same.



             The good news: ENI has announced the sanction of the Nikiatchuq field. DNR granted
             royalty relief at low prices last month, and they are now going to move forward on
             development.  They will spend nearly 1.5 billion dollars to develop 180 million barrels of
             oil in the shallow offshore. First production will occurr in late 2009.
