            Governor - I just received a phone call from Representative Bob Roses . Rep. Roses would
            like to speak with you directly regarding a campaign kick-off that he is arranging and
            would like you to be a part of.



            He can be reached at     Privileged   (cell)



            Thanks, Janice
