          Dear Governor Palin,




          I hope Senator McCain selects you to run for Vice President . My wife delivered a Down's
          Syndrome child ( my step-son ). I am sure the Lord selects special people to have them; as
          he surely has done with you.




          Take Care,




          Evan Slaughenhoupt




                                                                1
