             It might be worth noting, too, that the story list was finalized before I got it, too. Not
             sure about the overlap between when I came on board and when Gail left, but it's entirely
             possible that she approved the story list. It also chapped my ass that there was no talk
             between Gail and Fagan (not surprisingly) about the six-figure salary she had given
             herself as commission chair that went away when she did.



             I've been stewing about this since yesterday's broadcast. If there are any apologies owed
             to anyone, it's Fagan who should be apologizing to all the people who worked on the book
             whom he has painted with the broad brush of "liar" and "propagandist". What an ignorant
             insulting PoS he is.

           Kris, could I share your two emails with Senator Stevens? Together, they are an excellent
           exposition of the situation and what we're doing about it.



           I think he knows that none of us is the problem, but I'd like to confirm this with him.

            I'm glad to read Senator Stevens message to the Governor. This "issue" was initiated on
            the Dan Fagan show. In addition to Fagan, it sounds like it is being perpetuated by Gail
            Phillips and Myrna Maynard. Their concern is over the lack of coverage in the book of
            Senator Stevens and that it was intentional by me and the Governor. Gail stating that the
            Governor needs to apologize to Senator Stevens.



            During her chair of the commission, Gail initiated this agreement with Faircount
            Publishing.  Is was a "no-cost publishing agreement". Faircount makes their money from
            the advertisers.  And, they are not an "official" publication. The stories that appear in
            the book were done by local authors contracted by Faircount. Mark Kelsey was able to
            provide some editorial oversight (although not much as Faircount has been extremely
            difficult to work with). Neither myself or the Governor saw the book before it went to
            print.




            Again, I'm glad that Senator Stevens understands that this is not what they are trying to
            make of it.

            Senator Stevens has asked me to convey his thoughts concerning the Statehood book. I
            think that the best way to do this is to transmit his email to me ( pasted below). I have
            also included my response to him.



            If you would like me to do more , please let me know.

           I'll convey your thoughts to the Governor immediately.



           I'm not familiar with the Statehood book. However, I have tried to become a student of
           the Statehood effort, which is the premise for much of what I've worked on since my coming
           on the scene in 1969. So, if there's anything you think I can do-to set the record
           straight, I will.



            I'm glad that last Saturday's meeting went well, and I appreciated your getting back to me
            so quickly on the logistics.

           John: will you please get word to the governor that i knew of the statehood book-and had a
           comment or two about it.

             I told those who commented that i had no problem with that publication. I am a
           candidate-and while i haven't seen it and don't have time to read it i don't condone the
           criticism of it regarding me.

             Last thing i need is a dispute over my role in or since statehood. I'll leave that to
           historians.

              I'm told the investigators were appalled that i have no diaries, no records of phone
           calls, and no self-serving articles prepared by me.

           Has you know some of my staff are over-sensitive about publications which don't credit my
           office with miracles.

               Probably one of my staff or former staff on their own commented to fagan.

              I enjoyed to conversation with sarah last week and look forward to arranging ab event
           to show we are working together.

              Thanks. Teds
