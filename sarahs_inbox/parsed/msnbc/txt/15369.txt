         I agree to filing this in DC and trust those on this email list will be working off the
         same sheet of music to fight the intent of the Center's suit. I'm heading to Elmendorf so
         will be out of blackberry loop for an hour... Pls work with Sharon and Rosanne on getting
         out public statement out on our intention to suit. Thanks
