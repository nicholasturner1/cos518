            Hello Governor,

            Thank you for keeping me informed with everything that is taking place, but please let me know if there's anything you
            would like for me to do or respond to.

            As far as the current staff at the Residence- we have been asked where the kids are enrolled as people are curious, but our
            reply had been that "we don't know"- which was accurate and honest since we never received word that a decision was
            made or we say that we're not at liberty to give out personal information- I just gauge my response based on why and how
            they're asking... not wanting to sound like we have a gag order. I haven't given out information to the contractors as it's not
            necessary and not our business to tell-of course if it's obvious that you'll be in Jnu. at a particular event and it's something
            you or Sharon have made public then they'll know.

            The sense that I get is- of course Juneauites would love to have the Governor move in and live here, but (especially those
            with children) seem understanding of your decision in regards to your family. The majority of families can relate to the
            juggling that takes place to manage a home/kids.

            I'm sorry I don't pass on all the positive comments that people have to say in regards to your family and that they love seeing
            the buoy swings and trampoline in the yard and that the 3rd floor lights are on- basically they love seeing the House in full
            swing with the hustle and bustle of a family living in it. Those kind of comments aren't anything political just neighborly
            stuff. I m adding this because I don't think most regular people would write an editorial comment- so you don't hear from
            some of the every day citizens (moms, etc..we're too busy!!) who even though we live in Jnu. can relate to your decisions-
            even if you do have a much bigger job then most. :)

            We love it when you and the family are here, but the positive thing for the House is that while you're not here; I'm going to
            take full advantage of every minute to get the plumbing project moving along. A 95 year old house can hold some surprises
            during a project of this size- not to mention any kind of construction project- so my hope is to let them work the long hours
            and if anything unexpected crops up- then we hopefully have some time stock-piled and can stay on schedule.

            This morning we met again with prospective contractors on another walk through and are getting the logistics and questions
            worked out- getting the engineer/architect plans meshed with the contractors. When the bid is awarded I can give you (Todd
            and Janice) the proposed schedule and we can adjust it according to yours.

            Take care!

            Erika

              Sorry this took awhile to track down . The attached is an explanation of the two items you asked about,
              deployment of the AANG and the August 30 funeral service.

              In short this office was not informed of the deployment of the 15 members from the AANG to Afghanistan

              We regretted the funeral because this is a monthly ceremony that the base does and was not specific to any one
              individual that was killed in action . These ceremonies 's occurs once a month and this one in particular was for the
              active duty Army component not for the ANG troops.

                    Military Funerals/ Memorials/ Ceremonies

                    There are three types of events where families and organizations honor our fallen troops:
                    funerals, memorial services , and ceremonies. Funerals and memorial services are
                    sponsored by the family and protocol is directed by the family. This includes where the
                    event will be held and who will be invited. Ceremonies are controlled by 3rd party
                    individuals. These events may honor one or multiple fallen warriors, by name or by
                    affiliation.

                    On August 30, 2007 Fort Richardson Rear Detachment, 4d' Brigade Combat Team led a
                    Unit Memorial Ceremony to honor their coworkers who died overseas. This event has
                    been happening about once a month due to the high number of casualties the 4/25 has
                    taken while deployed to Iraq.

                    The Rear Detachment Commander, Captain Brent Fogelman, contacted protocol to invite
                    their preferred list of dignitaries to attend the event. Unfortunately we have had five
                    fatalities of Alaska National Guard members in the War on Terror. These have all
                    occurred before August 2006. From this time the active duty component has suffered
                    losses and therefore controls all memorial type events.

                   During the previous administration , advance notice of Soldier casualties was given
                   directly to the Governor by the United States Army Alaska Commander. The previous
                   administration violated the confidential release requirements set to protect the loved ones
                   of the fallen Soldier. Due to this violation the United States Army Alaska will no longer
                   provide/ release sensitive information.

                   The Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs is in regular contact with the
                   United States Army Alaska protocol office to make sure lists are kept current and the
                   appropriate staffers are included on each list. DMVA is often not invited to the same
                   events as the Governor and we recognize the importance to have clear, dependable
                   contacts in the Governor's office for timely notification by United States Army Alaska.
                   The Office of the Governor is notified through Governor Palin ' s scheduler and the regret
                   email concerning yesterday' s unit memorial ceremony is attached.

                   Deployment Updates and Communication to the Office of the Governor

                   Until this week there is has been successful communication between our two offices to
                   make sure proper notification is given for the Governor to maximize every opportunity to
                   be with her troops, the Alaska National Guard.

                   The National Guard "joint operations center" gathers force allocation data and distributes
                   this to division leaders and the Office of the Commissioner . This report provides a one
                   stop source for how many Soldiers and Airmen are deployed , where they are deployed to,
                   and what unit is being tasked.




                                                                                                            PRA GSP0I_0004358

                    Unfortunately the Air Guard deployment to Afghanistan was not added to this report. I
                    am very sensitive to providing Governor Palin with every opportunity to support her
                    troops and I have already directed Air Guard leadership to ensure the proper notification
                    will take place to alert Governor Palin in a timely fashion.

                    I am taking personal responsibility for these actions and you may see command structure
                    changes due to these mistakes.
