           Dear Governor Palin:




           I receive the Famiy Research Council's Washington Update via email each day, and today, I
           was so touched by the wonderful story of your new son's birth. From a pro-life, pro-
           family individual (and family) who lives many, many miles from you, I felt I wanted to
           send you a personal note. What a blessing your new little son will be, and may God bless
           you in the days to come. I wish we had more good folks like you in office in America
           today.



           Blessings,

           Jeanelle Bennett
