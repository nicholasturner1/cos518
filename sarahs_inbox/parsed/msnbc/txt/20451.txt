          MESSAGE:

          Read the article about your new son Trig in the Baptist Press.



          We have a down syndrome daughter and she has been a blessing to us. She is now 34 years
          old and living in a home with several other dvelopmentally challenged ladies. She enjoys
          her independence and the opportunity to "visit" home on the holidays. Below is a poem I
          found when my daughter was born. I'm sure you will be blessed by it as my wife and I were.

          "IT'S TIME AGAIN FOR ANOTHER BIRTH,"



          SAID THE ANGELS OF THE LORD ABOVE.



          "THIS SPECIAL CHILD WILL NEED MUCH LOVE,



          HER PROGRESS MAY SEEM VERY SLOW:



          ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE MAY NOT SHOW.



          AND SHE'LL REQUIRE MUCH EXTRA CARE



          FROM ALL THE FOLKS SHE MEETS DOWN THERE.



          SHE MAY NOT LAUGH OR RUN OR PLAY;



          HER THOUGHTS MAY SEEM QUITE FAR AWAY,



          IN MANY WAYS , SHE WON'T ADAPT,



          AND SHE'LL BE KNOWN AS      ' HANDICAPPED'.



          SO LET'S BE CAREFUL WHERE SHE'S SENT,



          WE WANT HER LIFE TO BE CONTENT.



          PLEASE,   LORD,   FIND THE PARENTS WHO




          WILL DO THIS SPECIAL JOB FOR YOU.



          THEY WILL NOT REALIZE RIGHT AWAY



          THE LEADING ROLE THEY ' RE ASKED TO.PLAY,

                                                               2

          BUT WITH THE CHILD FROM ABOVE,



          COMES STRONGER FAITH AND RICHER LOVE.



          AND SOON THEY'LL KNOW THE PRIVILEGE GIVEN



          IN CARING FOR THIS GIFT FROM HEAVEN



          THEIR PRECIOUS CHILD SO MEEK AND MILD



          IS "HEAVEN'S VERY SPECIAL CHILD".
