             Lyda voted for AGIA.

             She's dropping out due to all the recent polls showing how far behind Linda she is.

            You can tell Ross , that, in ypur own special way. My phone won't allow me coverage through
           Nenana. :)

             Governor-




              Channel 2 just called to say that lyda just issued a press release saying she will not
            seek reelection . She says it is because of the AGIA process . She says it has the support
            of many of her constituents but she thinks it is a disasterous move for the state. Mike
            ross would like a comment from you. He knows you are travelling to fbks. If it is at all
            possible to give him a comment - he is at 762 9248.
