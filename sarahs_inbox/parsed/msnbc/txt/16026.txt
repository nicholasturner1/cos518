          MESSAGE:

          I previously submitted these concerns almost two weeks ago. It is extremely hard to
          believe there is very little outrage with this governor's expectation that bonds will
          simply make up & cover the vetoed items. Has everyone forgotten how bonds are paid for?
          When bonds are approved, and most of them are due to voter ignorance or lack of knowledge
          and/or understanding, property owners like myself will see their property taxes go up.
          That is her solution to handling our budget when oil is at record highs & expected to go
          even higher?




          Again- Regarding the article; "Palin's veto ax lops $268 million from budget" , and as a
          conservative Alaskan who did vote for Palin. If oil was $60 or $70 per barrel, I could see
          being more careful with spending and taking such action as Palin just did. Cutting the
          budget like Palin just did while we currently have $130+ oil & putting people out of work
          and ultimately impacting economic spending in the process is recklessly irresponsible,
          unacceptable & without saying- completely unnecessary. The "saving for a rainy day"
          justification is no longer an excuse with the amount of revenues this state is now taking
          in on oil alone. My own personal survey on this action by Palin with friends, family &
          acquaintances resulted in every single person agreeing with me, and they will not be
          voting for her again as well if she where to run for re-election (either for Governor
          again or for a higher office).




          Words cannot express our disappointment in this governor's decision making process
          regarding the budget axing & then expecting property owners to foot the remaining balance
          with increased property taxes.  Many people I have spoken to can only view Palin's recent
          demeanor & actions as an arrogant carelessness to show she has a position of power, and
          that she will use it at any cost. Regardless of the amount of people's lives that will
          unfortunately & unnecessarily be adversely affected with job losses. Again, Palin's
          actions come when oil is $130+ a barrel. This is entirely unacceptable action by any
          sitting governor.




          I truly believe I speak for numerous people in Alaska right now with my comments. The most
          disturbing part of this issue is that Governor Palin must truly believe we are not paying
          enough property taxes already.   The cost of property taxes has already caused some people
          to lose their homes and/or leave the state. Property taxes are too high in Anchorage as
          it is. To have this casual expectation for property owners to pay more property taxes
          right now when oil is at record highs (to make up the difference) is equally appalling?
          No one should have to lose their job with oil being at record highs (especially teachers &
          teacher assistants/aides), nor should property taxes go higher and cause more damage to
          families.    I also just learned that the Anchorage Police Dept. was once again denied
          their requested funding for more office space for storing records, and that is
          unacceptable as well with our oil revenues being at record highs.

              Joe, do we have any idea what Flint Hills' refinery margins are? Koch is not a
              publically traded company. So, I don't know the answer, but if there high, Koch
              doesn't have much of an argument.

              Senator Stevens has focused primarily on the cost of aviation fuel and the possible
              loss of air traffic through Anchorage and Fairbanks. However, I don't know that
              there's any assurance that Flint Hills would pass on any savings to the ultimate
              consumers.

              There has been some meandering discussion about granting an exemption from
              the Alaska aviation tax, which is currently at 3.2 cents per gallon. There is such an
              exemption for jet fuel used by foreign carriers. I'm told that a domestic exemption
              would cost the State about $4 million per year.

              If you need Kevin's white paper, I'll dredge it up for you.

                  Joe-pls orchestrate an op-ed on this as we don't want flint hills pulling up stakes, leaving town
                  and blaming us. As Tom points out we've done much for them and they have not shown us what
                  it is they need via open books, etc.

                  any kind of accusation like that , in fact we need to be proactive here and let Alaskans know of

                  Representatives of Koch Industries were in DC for a board of = directors meeting a couple of
                  weeks ago and met with the Alaska Congression= al Delegation and staff to discuss the future of
                  the Flint Hills Refinery .&= nbsp; We are told that Koch intends to make a decision about the
                  refinery' s= future on or about June 15th.

                  These representatives believe that the location differential premium = for state royalty oil
                  (averaging $ 1.08 per barrel between April 2004 to = March 2008 ) causes the Flint Hills Refinery to
                  be unprofitable . They = further allege that the State has been unresponsive to their = concerns.

                  In the aftermath of the Koch meetings, which I did not know about at = the time, I have been
                  involved in an email dialog with Senator Stevens .&nbs= p; Armed with an excellent white paper

                  used to be 15 cents and has been creeping up = for several years , will likely be reduced later this
                  year after DNR = completes its audit of marine transportation costs.

                  Because of the various substantive and political considerations = associated with a possible
