          Dear governor palin.  Yesterday and probably today were rough on you. I have no idea what
          your movie tastes are like. However last night I went to the glacier cinema in the
          mendenhall valley at 7 30 and saw mama Mia and although most of the audience was women I
          enjoyed it and for two hours my mind was off the legislature.     If you are at all inclined
          to like Abba I recommend it. I always liked abba.      Take care.    Talis.
