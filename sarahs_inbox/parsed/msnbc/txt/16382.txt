                   Subject: Second Amendment/Supreme Court

                 Great news. The US Supreme Court has affirmed the opinion of the US Court of
                 Appeals for DC, which invalidated the DC gun law. (See below)

                 As soon as the Supreme Court opinion is available, I will be back in touch.


                  10:13 Ben Winograd -
                            The Court has released the opinion in District of Columbia v Heller (07-290), on
                            whether the District's firearms regulations - which bar the possession of handguns and
                            require shotguns and rifles to be kept disassembled or under trigger lock - violate the
                            Second Amendment. The ruling below, which struck down the provisions in question, is
                            affirmed.

                            Justice Scalia wrote the opinion. Justice Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Stevens,
                            Souter and Ginsburg . We will provide a link to the decision as soon as it is available.
                  10:13 Tom Goldstein - Second Amendment protects an individual right to
                            possess a firearm.
                  10:14 Tom Goldstein - It is striking that the decision is not clouded by ambiguity
                        created by separat
                         10:16 Tom Goldstein - Apologies - there is a second dissenting opinion, but
                               only one majority - no plurality and no concurrences
                        e opinions. One opinion on each side.
