            I received a message from Paulette: Rick Urion passed awat today. He's a former legislator
            from Anc and recently retired as director of occ licensing under the Palin Admin. wanted
            to let you guys know can we can get flags lowered. I'll send details after I talk to
            paulette, that is unless you guys heard the news while I was on my last flight.
