                  Subject: Meeting with Commissioner Kopp and Commissioner Kreitzer

                Governor.

                I had a very good meeting with Commissioner Kopp and Commissioner Kreitzer today . They are going to work
                together on some steps they can take fairly quickly to help with recruiting and an issue with implementing VOIP
                phones at DPS that Walt was not helping resolve . (DPS is the only state agency resisting the VOIP phones) If
                we can get the issue fixed , we can probably avoid significant costs for ADMIN . We talked about a number of
                other issues as well.

                Basically, we made more progress in one hour with Commissioner Kopp on DPS issues than we were able to
                make with Walt in months.
