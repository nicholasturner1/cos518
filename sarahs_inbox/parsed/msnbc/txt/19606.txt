               You know, that's something Kopp could come right out of the shoot with, even in a presser:
               filling the long-vacant positions w efforts to recruit our returning military personnel. Lots of
               these soldiers don't know what to do next as their deployments conclude... we may need them.
               Pls mention this to him, that we need very vocal and visual DPS initiatives rolled out for
               Alaskans so they'll know the purpose in all this transition is for action in serving the public.
               Rolling out such a promise, Sharon and Rosanne could help because we got a good supportive
               statement from Col. Holloway re: Kopp and "moving forward"... we could incorporate that
               statement with any from Gen. Campbell also. (So not just Natl Guard, but military in.general.)

              Thanks Governor. Its an interesting approach that I like. Plus, we don 't even need the whole 19 million
              acre reserve, just 2, 000 acres where the oil is and enough to get it out of the reserve. Amazing that
              democrats in Congress will call for steps like not adding small amounts of oil to the strategic reserve and
              tout that as helpful to the energy crisis but then complain the million barrels a day in oil and trillions of
              cubic feet of natural gas in ANWR isn't enough to help the nation.

              I'll be in Anchorage today and tomorrow meeting with Chuck Kopp to discuss steps we can take on crime
              in rural Alaska and improving recruiting etc. There are several things Wait didn 't really seem to work hard
              on or want to do, like recruiting from returning National Guard and military , or finding ways to improve our
              local option laws and cracking down on bootlegging that could be helpful . I will pass these ideas on to
              Chuck and mention the recruiting ideas to Joe Schmidt for DOC to consider.

              Fyi- congressman hall from texas is introducing a bill that would transfer ownership of ANWR from the
              feds to the state. I'm on record supporting the idea and his bill. It may be an interesting subject for
              alaskans to hear about. I've promised expedited development if the transfer were ever to take place.
