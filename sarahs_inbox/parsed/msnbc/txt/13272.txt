             Before the summer driving season kicks in- and that's assuming we may not need legislation
             to eliminate collection of the gas tax. I'm hearing there are ways we may get to do this,
             and one catalyst is the Juneau power outage that some see as a vehicle to declare the
             necessity to give alaskans a break on outrageous energy costs.

             Governor,



             Are these discussions in preparation for another special session call? Or are you looking
             at action next year in the regular session?

              My desire is to go forth with eliminating this , and in addition we'll double this effort
              by making leggies act on my tire tax repeal bill also at the same time since it's still
              sitting there ready to be acted upon . So, whatever you guys gotta do to accomplish that,
              please do asap . Thanks

              (On my end I can enlist Kris and Ivy to help out ... and I'll cc Russ when you let me know
              the most expedient way of accomplishing these two goals so he can get lawmakers ready.)
