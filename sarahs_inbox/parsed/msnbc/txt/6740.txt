         Governor:



         You asked whether we have purchased the old valley Hospital, the $5.0 million for the
         purchase was in the FY07 budget - yes, it was purchased .  The Court System and DOA
         received an additional $ 5.0 million to begin to renovate the building for occupancy and to
         construct a walkway between what is now the Palmer State Office Building and the Court
         System building.




         You asked for additional information on the Alaska Public Offices Commission electronic
         filing project ($ 350,000 ) in our capital budget and the cost of hand entry of data. It
         may be another day or two before I can get that for you.




        The PERS / TRS technical fix bill is on the House floor tomorrow ; we are trying to get
        amendments ready for SB 125 / cost share ( which is now scheduled for Thurs . afternoon) and I
        will be involved in ARM Board meetings Thursday and Friday , so - I apologize in advance
        for any slow response on the APOC information.




                                                                  1
