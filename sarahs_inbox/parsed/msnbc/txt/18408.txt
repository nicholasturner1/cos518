         You're a gem for always seeking expedient solutions to our little daily chaos episodes.
         I'll look at those last #s of the credit card - thanks Janice! Go home and enjoy your
         boys.

         Governor - I just spoke with Linda Perez in this regards .                 You tried to

         use the "State Gas Card ."        This " gas card" usually is left in the

         vehicle .    Your state credit card that you need to use for purchases ends

         in ....3085 .     Janice

         The state credit card, again, won't let me use it. I'm standing here

         trying to pay for PPT tax team's dinner - the card is rejected as a

         "Fleet card only"...       I very rarely use this and haven't purchased

         anythingl on it for a long time - but it wasn't rejected last time.

         I'll use personal credit card.
