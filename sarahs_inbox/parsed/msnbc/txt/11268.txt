               thought you'd appreciate this response from Jay on new policy... he sums it up well. (Jay was always days
               behind responding to email until we got him a blackberry. Now....)

               I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but its gonna suck not having a crack-berry. I'll be even further behind on
               my email. I wonder if they've thought about the lost productivity when everyone decides its not worth being under
               the ethics microscope.

               Looks like I'm turning in my state blackberry. I'm not going to log every personal call where most last less than two
               minutes betw me and Sandy coordinating logistics --some state, some personal.



               You guys may want to examine the new policy and see whether you want to be turning in reports every month.
