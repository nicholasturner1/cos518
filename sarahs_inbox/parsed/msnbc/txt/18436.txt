         Governor - I have put your flight schedules on the calendar. You will be coming down to
         Juneau on the 6:00 p.m. fit. On Tuesday. I have you returning to Anchorage on Thursday
         the 1:30 p.m. flight.  As of Sept. 1, AK Airlines has discontinued the early evening
         flight back to Anchorage so that would only leave you the late 8:00 p.m. flight and get
         you in Anchorage @ 10:30 p.m.



         Have a Wonderful Labor Day Weekend with your family. Tell Todd we got cut off on the
         phone this a.m. but that I am working on scheduling. Thanks, Janice
