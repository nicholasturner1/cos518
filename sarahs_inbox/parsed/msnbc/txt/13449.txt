            MESSAGE:

            May I congratulate you on the birth of your new blessing !  We heard of this on the Glenn
            Beck show and are so impressed by your attitude about this child. The children with
            Down's Syndrome are surely an added benefit to families , although this is not recognized
            by the system.

            May I say how glad we are to have a person with your values in a place of leadership. The
            Republicans surely could use some more people of your persuasion. We will be praying for
            you and yours.

            Sincerely,

            Mr. and Mrs. James Norton
