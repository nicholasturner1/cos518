         Newsweek would be delighted to have her attend with you. Please see note below.

         I should hear more soon about media opportunities so you can make a final decision about
         the conference.

         Beth: Many thanks for your email this evening. The Governor would be most welcome to
         bring her daughter to Newsweek's Women and Leadership Conference. Thank you for alerting
         us of this possibility and we can most certainly accommodate this request.

         With warmest best wishes,

         Mark

         Would it be possible for Gov. Palings 16-year-old daughter to attend the Newsweek
         conference with the governor?
