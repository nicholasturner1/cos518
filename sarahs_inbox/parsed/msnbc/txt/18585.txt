         Dear Ms. Fritsch:




         Governor Palin received your email correspondence regarding touch screen voting machines
         and asked that I reply to your concerns.



        The security, accuracy and reliability of our voting systems are of utmost importance.
        The Division of Elections takes allegations, such as those presented in the Dan Rather
        special, very seriously.



        As you may know, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 required states to have voting
        equipment in place that is accessible to the visually impaired and disabled by 2006. This
        is why states nationwide began implementing touch screen voting units. This federal
        requirement has not changed, and the State of Alaska must continue to follow this law.



        The Division of Elections is in the process of reviewing our equipment as well as our
        security procedures as we prepare for the 2008 Primary and General Elections. We are also
        taking the added steps of seeking a third party review of our existing voting systems and
        security procedures.



        You mention HR811, also known as the Holt bill, which establishes additional federal
        requirements for election systems.  There has been significant opposition to this
        legislation and it is currently stalled for the time being in the House Rules Committee.
        Members of the committee have also expressed concerns with the current version of the
        bill.  The last I heard is that that the earliest it could be scheduled for another
        hearing is tomorrow, September 12.



        As you know, the Holt bill requires that the touch screen voting units                    be equipped with a
        voter verifiable paper audit trail and requires auditing procedures of                    election results.
        Although the State of Alaska's requirements do not exactly mimic those                    of the Holt bill,
        there are requirements for a paper trail and audit of election results                    in our state.



        In Alaska, our touch screen voting units are equipped with a voter verifiable paper audit
        trail that allows a voter to review his or her ballot prior to it being cast on the voting
        unit.  There are some states that do not have this requirement and utilize touch screen
        voting units that do not have a voter verifiable paper audit trail. Alaska also has paper
        ballots available at every polling place for those who do not want to use touch screen
        voting units to cast their vote. Fortunately, our state allows voters the choice on how
        they cast their ballot.



        Additionally,    there is a canvass of all election results statewide conducted by a
                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP0I_0004639

         bipartisan State Review Board prior to an election being certified. In addition to the
         review of election counts and materials from all polling places statewide by the
         bipartisan State Review Board, a hand count of one precinct in each of the 40 House
         Districts is conducted. The precinct is randomly selected from those precincts that
         comprise at least 5% of the total number of ballots cast in that House District. If the
         results of the hand count are off by more than 1% between the results of the hand count
         and the count certified by the election board, the entire House District will be recounted
         by hand count. The paper ballots for the optical scan machines and paper ballots on the
         touch screen machines serve as the official ballot cast and is the record that is hand
         counted. Once the State Review Board is confident that the results reported are accurate,
         the election is certified.



         To learn more about Alaska's election process, visit the division's Web site at
         www.elections.state.ak.us. If you have specific suggestions on how we can improve
         elections in Alaska, please let me know. I am very interested in hearing how we can
         provide better service to Alaskans.



         Sincerely,

         Whitney Brewster, Director

         Division of Elections

         MESSAGE:

         On the 14th of August, Dan Rather at http://hd.net/drr227.html had a report about the
         touch screen voting machines that would indicate serious flaws in these machines. They
         should all be returned for our money back or replaced with ones that really can be
         certified! Or sued!rnrnHR-811 is rumored to be going to the floor of the House for a vote
         on Wed . Sept . 5. They would not allow it to go for a vote unless they had the votes to
         pass it so, I imagine, it is now a done deal. However, suddenly we are being informed that
         those who were hoping for the benefits of the bill for 2008 are probably going to be
         disappointed. It seems that through the writing of the bill and three complete rewrites
         there is a funding problem. When the bill goes to the floor there will be a bipartisan
         "unfunded mandate" amendment that will be allowed to be voted on and added to the bill if
         it passes . This amendment will require action on the bill to be held up until funding can
         be appropriated; in othe!

         r words 2010 or 2012 or never. So everything is status quo for 2008 (DREs, no vvpat, no
         audits) except no one can say if the non-funding portions of the bill would also be
         delayed. So the protection of the vendor's software may happen upon signature by the
         President. The vendors are protected while the voters get no protections. And, Holt and
         his people knew about this for months. I'm told it was public information but if no one
         points you to the information the information is not public; it's hidden in plain
         sight.... rnrn·  NAtional: Making the World Safe For Voting machine vendors
