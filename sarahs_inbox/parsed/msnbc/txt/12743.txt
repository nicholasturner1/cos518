            Marilyn and her sister are headed to JNU tomorrow evening to finish up the project                   sunday.
            They'll be working in the basement of the house. They are fine staying at a hotel                    (which
            she also told me on phone) but the question has risen about staying at the house.                    I can
            tell them you're out of town and recommend hotel, especially since it is so late,                    but
            thought I better check.

              Erika,

             Due to (lack of) flight availability we will be coming in Saturday night on the late
            flight. It is #70 that arrives at 9:33pm. Is that too late for you or should we get a
            hotel and meet you in the morning?

             Marilyn

             Hello Marilyn,



             It's good to hear that you'll be in Juneau. Let me know what flight you're on and I can
            meet you at the House to let you in. The family room downstairs has a lot of room for you
            to work on the project. My cell phone number is PjEviie ed



             Best regards,

             Erika

             Erika,

             We finally are ready to finish the map of Alaska. Hopefully it is still in the basement
            tv room of the mansion. My sister Loralee and I will be flying to Juneau this weekend. I
            know Kris talked to you about Sunday. I hope that will work OK. We need to work on the
            piece a little before we take it to the office at the capitol. Let me know what we need to
            do to make this work.

             Marilyn Lane
