           Hello Congresswoman Palin,

           I am a mother of a 4 year old daughter with Down Syndrome and we live in northeast chic.
           We have formed the Down syndrome association of the Valley (www.dsav.org )
           Congratulations on the birth of Trey!! I applaud your efforts bringing Down syndrome into
           the spotlight of Congress and thus america. Our hopes and dreams for our Daughter, Lauren
           are no different than any other child. We hope for her to reach her fullest potential and
           be a productive person in society!!

           Sincerely

           Michele Jones
