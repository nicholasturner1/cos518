               Where is our enema policy and vision for Alaska?
               Why not start the discussion now instead of waiting for January of 09?


               Please review the 3 attachments as very strong views on:

              -- A new society overnight with a place in the history of the planet
              ---A new mindset for our residential sector and calm to our communities
              --A near last resort attitude if we continue as we are

              How can thousands of people vote for Men under indightment, 30 years in office, 75 to 84 years old,
              while taking the 5th to us?
              no oil in pipeline for 40 years, no gas line,
              lbillion of my $s payoff to producers for protection and not even calling the producers and refineries
              before us the public for a full understanding of what is happening,


              Someone has to begin the new direction in public discussion...
