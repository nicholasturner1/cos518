              I knew it wouldn't play well in the media tonight! Legislators said

              they knew two months ago that Conoco was going to cancel the

             project--Conoco's decision to cancel the project had nothing to do with

             ACES!        Woo hoo

              Just watched ktuu lead w the conoco refinery story for the third time.

             The conoco vp says this is not payback for the tax increase, but he

              seems awfully smug . Does he ( and others ) think that alaskans are going

              to back down ? That the admin . And legislature are going to go back and

              change the tax structure again because the producers don't like it? It's

             not going to happen . Alaskans support aces and finally being on an even

             playing field... just my two cents

               I just walked in the door in time to catch the news. I can ' t believe

             conoco is letting their pride get in the way of doing a good thing-they

             cancelled upgrades of their refinery . This , I'm sure , will not sit well

             w the average alaskan . In fact , their decision plays into the perception

             that is already out there - that they try and bully the state . I hope they

             set their pride aside by nov 30-alaskans expect them to! And, I hope

             they remember we (alaskans ) are rallied behind our governor who's

             looking out for OUR best interest . In the mean time , if there ' s anything

                                                              2
