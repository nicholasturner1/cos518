             Sunny- the email you forwarded to a list of state employees this morning re: better
             communications with mayors just got posted on the ADN blog after being leaked to a
             reporter. Any idea who'd leak such a thing?

             I AM NOT, nor have I ever in the past dated Steve Quinn. And, for the record, I won't date
             him in the future either. Thank you and feel free to leak this email.
