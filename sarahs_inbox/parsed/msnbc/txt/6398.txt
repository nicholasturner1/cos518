        Subject :                 Extradiction


        I have a new extradition request. There is an outstanding arrest warrant for Michael
        Cottings on four counts of nonsupport of dependents from the State of Ohio. Everything
        looks in order so I will sign the order and get it back to the Criminal Division at the
        Department of Law.
