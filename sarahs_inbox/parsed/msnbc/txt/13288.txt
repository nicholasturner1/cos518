            He should like Joe...Joe is fighting the union on the issues that are now evidently the
            public issues. Joe isn 't afraid to fight them, for what is right. Does he need my
            encouragement to go on?

            Just a heads up that Dan Fagan is trying to get Joe Schmidt to go on his

             show today. Sharon says Fagan is very anti-union. We don't have final

             confirmation yet that Joe is going to do it.
