           MESSAGE:

           Honorable Governor Palin,




           Your friends and admirers from Olympia, Washington, suggested I contact you -- especially
           those representing the National Day of Prayer. I will be conducting a communion service on
           the steps of the Alaska State House this Saturday (06/21108), at 11:23 AN. This is
           Communion-event number twenty-three of fifty one events. The final event is the Nation's
           Capitol in Washington DC, December 19-20, 2008.




           I am the Founder of the SEAL America Campaign -- National Communion 2008
           [www.sealamerica . org (918 ) 237-64401 . I am personally traveling to every State in the USA,
           this year , gathering Christians who love America , to join me for an open , outdoor
           communion service , to bless our State Legislatures and America . SEAL America is not a
           political organization , nor do we have a political agenda -- our aim is higher.




                                                                1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0019607

           SEAL America has received three state proclamations , thus far, and I am in hopes to
           receive one from Alsaska . We intend to ask President Bush to sign a Presidential
           Proclaimation recognizing a National Day of Communion , this November.




           I will call your office, Friday. I am in hopes you will spend a few minutes with me to
           discuss SEAL America and the Alaska State Communion , and have a word of prayer.




          Larry Huggins, DD
