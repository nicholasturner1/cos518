          Sounds like rebecca palsha will be their gal in Juneau during session. Could u make sure
          she gets an invite to Gov's House bbq on Wednesday, 5pm, we'll sign a couple of bills
          there at that time while we're welcoming lawmakers back for sp session. They'll be doing
          live 5, 6, and lOpm newscasts - they're welcome to do the live at the mansion that
          evening. Thanks
