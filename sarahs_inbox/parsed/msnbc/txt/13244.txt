             No problem at all- some of these days are impossible to keep up with! Thank you.



             I'm worried about the Dept of Corrections union stuff going on, so I hope Joe's media guy
             is on it. Joe is an outstanding commish - he's cleaned things up by ridding the dept of a
             few bad apples and the union turned on him. Whatever you can do to help the dept out with
             messaging , pls do. Thanks

             Governor, we will work to make sure. all media requests/accepts are put

             on your schedule and that Kris is kept in the loop. I take

             responsibility for our failure to do this over the last few days.
