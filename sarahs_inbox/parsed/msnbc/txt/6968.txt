               Governor,
               We just won another PTU decision. Judge Michalski dismissed, with prejudice, the
               lawsuit Exxon filed against the state asking for damages for the state's decision to
               terminate the Pt Thomson Unit. This ruling is very good and another step in our efforts
               to bring the state's valuable resource into production. Congratulations Governor!
               Marty
