           Hi Kari,
           I was hoping that you could help me . We are running our quarterly newsletter and wanting to feature the event
           that we hosted for the Governor. Our CEO would like us to use a quote from the Governor in the article. Could
           you help me to get a quote from her press office to publish in the newsletter? I remember her saying that it was 'a
           memorable event and was honored to receive the Elders ' words of wisdom and gifts.'
           Thanks for all of your help.
           Annette
