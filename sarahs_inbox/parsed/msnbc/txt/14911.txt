          MESSAGE:

          Congratulations on the birth of your child, Trig. I'm happy to see the report and that
          you are well. I'm sure you are quickly learning about the challenges a boy with Down's
          can present, but I'm also sure you will face those challenges with grace and confidence.

          As a Lutheran pastor, I've accompanied several families through their journeys with
          special needs children and have always been impressed by the joy they've found in their
          children.  May you and your son be an example to us all and may God continue to bless you
          and your family.
