            Waiting to hear what Comm's press release says on the issue- it's come across all wrong
            (the letter to lyda) and is right back on my lap with the press reports that have already
            been filed. Not good. I need you guys to help clarify asap and work with Comm on getting
            the right message out on this sp session call issue.

            Arghhhhh! It came across all wrong already! We need help fixing this asap before more
            stories are filed. The press release has to set the record straight asap.

            Sharon just emailed the letter to Debbie Joslin , Debbie's going to try to call in before
            5pm to help set this record straight.



            Debbie had some awesome thoughts on how this issue went down previously.



            Copied Debbie above.
