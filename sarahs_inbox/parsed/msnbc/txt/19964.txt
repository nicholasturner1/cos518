          MESSAGE:

          I think the governor is being targeted by Sen Lydia Green and any comment she makes
          should be ignored. Regardless of what isgoing with alaska top cop she is doing what is
          best for the state \. I am a democrat who does not agree with her on all issues, but I
          think she is the m\best governor we have had in a long time for the state of alaska. As a
          democrate she can count on my vote, She has my respect as an indivual alsaka and if she
          choses to run again I as a democrate will suppport her
