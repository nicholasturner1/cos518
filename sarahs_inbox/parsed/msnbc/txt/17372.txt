       Rhonda Boyles called today to ask if I had any recommendations for the above

       mentioned board.       They're looking for someone from the Valley to decide

       which charitable organizations in the Valley should receive appropriations.

       She came up with Judith Carmony and Candy Easley. I haven't returned her

       call.      Thought I would run it by you first.
