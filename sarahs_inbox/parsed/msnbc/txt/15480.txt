         Good point. I expect we will hear more about that. Hopefully the initial flap will die
         down after a couple of days. Karen

         For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
         capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or
         understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operatin
         budget  PriyilanPri nr Parcnnal Matarial RPriar`tPri
        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




         The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the
         process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
         her budget.



         Just my observations.
