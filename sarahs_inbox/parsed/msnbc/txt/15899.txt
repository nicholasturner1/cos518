        .   MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,




            As a homeowner on Nancy Lake I was extremely disheartened and disappointed to see that you
            vetoed the budget request to upgrade our roads on the "Nancy Lake Peninsula". These roads
            were never developed to any standards, let alone borough standards.




            The Nancy Lake Homeowners Association worked through the prioroitization and ranking
            process with the Borough Roads Supervisors and Jim Norcross who identified this as the
            number one request from this road district. It then went to the Mat-Su Borough who also
            identified this as their highest priority budget request for this district.




                                                               I




                                                                                                            PRA GSPO1 _0019011

            Sen Huggins and Rep Nuemann both fully supported this project.



            You asked that budget request projects be vetted, ranked and have support from all
            regulatory, governing and oversight bodies to make it through your vetting process. This
            project had all of that, and more.




            As such, we are totally dismayed and confused that you would not only veto a portion of
            this funding request, but that you vetoed the entire request.




            Please advise what we need to do to receive budget funding approval from your
            administration for this project next year, when our request will be for more money as
            fuel, labor and material costs will be significantly higher.




            Respectfully submitted,




            Devery Prince, President
