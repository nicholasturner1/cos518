             DEAR MRS .    (GOV.) PALIN:




             CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BIRTH OF YOUR FIFTH CHILD! May our Lord Jesus and HIS mother,
             Mary., bless you and your family abundantly. I applaud you and your husband for welcoming
             into your family this child. Human beings with Down Syndrome are very special to our
             Lord; they truly embody his words, "Suffer the little ones to come unto ME for of such is
             the kingdom of Heaven."




            VIVA CRISTO REY!
