            Governor,




            Here are your remarks and event info for your 6 p.m. HB 330 bill signing (Noxious Weeds
            & Invasive Plants). This is a three-part event: bill signing, logo unveiling, &
            proclamation. Your remarks for the bill signing and proclamation portions are included;
            the logo unveiling does not require remarks.




            You should now have all three sets of remarks and information for your three bill signings
            tomorrow. Please let me know if you are missing anything or if you have any questions.
            Thanks so much!
