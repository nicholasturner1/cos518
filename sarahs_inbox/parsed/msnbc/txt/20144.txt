            Good morning, Governor. Having just learned of the event late last

            night, I am wrapping up remarks and will get them to you ASAP. I am

            waiting to receive detailed information on the declaration from McHugh,

            but should receive it and finish remarks within the hour. I am working

            to get them to you by 11:30 at the absolute latest.



            Kate
