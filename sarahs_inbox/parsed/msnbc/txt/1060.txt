Todd,



I received a phone call from our Facilities Mngr. this morning.



The alarm communications service, Securitas, that contacts the fire and police departments is not
working. The red box downstairs tests the system-if it goes off you can call me or re-set it. The main
alarms will work, but we would need to contact the fire/police dept. directly if there was an
emergency.



They will keep me updated. Call if you want more information or have any questions. This is also
affecting other state office bldgs.



Thanks,

Erika




                                                    1                             ROSTON 01907
