          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,




          On behalf of the Board and Staff of the National Down Syndrome Congress, congratulations
          to you and your husband on the birth of your son, Trig! Either now or in the future, we
          would be delighted to provide you with free, up-to-date information on issues related to
          Down syndrome.  When the time is right for your family, you might also want to consider
          attending an NDSC convention.  This year's event in Boston is expected to bring in close
          to 3,000 people from around the country ( as usual , we already have folks coming from
          Alaska!) and the world.



          Please don't hesitate to call or write if we can be of help and, again, congratulations!



          David Tolleson
