            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,



            Congratulations on the birth of your son. I had just read my monthly issue of the
            Catholic Anchor to learn that your baby has Down's syndrom. May God bless your family for
            bringing him into the world. I can not say it will be easy for you, especially with your
            high-profile job during his early years. But I will pray that you two parents receive all
            of the support that you need to give him a good start in life. I can already see that you
            have plenty of love in your hearts for your family and that will always prevail. Keep up
            the good work!
