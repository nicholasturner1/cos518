        Fairbanksan to fill vacant regents seat



        By Stefan Milkowski

          Published May 1, 2007




        JUNEAU - A Fairbanksan will fill the University of Alaska Board of Regents seat vacated
        by Jim Hayes , according to a spokeswoman for Gov . Sarah Palin.



        Meghan Stapleton, the spokeswoman, said Monday the governor had chosen a resident of
        Fairbanks to replace Hayes, who resigned last week. Palin will announce her appointment
        Thursday in Fairbanks at a Rotary International luncheon, where she was previously
        scheduled to speak, Stapleton said.



        Hayes, a former Fairbanks mayor, resigned Friday under pressure from the governor and
        lawmakers and following a federal indictment on charges of fraud unrelated to his service
        on the board of regents.



        Local lawmakers have expressed concern about Fairbanks' representation on the board, which
        is responsible for governing the statewide university system, and encouraged Palin to fill
        the seat with someone from Fairbanks.




        Stapleton did not say who was chosen.
