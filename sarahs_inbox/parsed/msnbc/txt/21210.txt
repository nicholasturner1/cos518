        I'll let Linda know. I believe Bob is talking with the troopers in NY on new flight
        arrangements/solutions.  Please let me know if I can do anything.

       They may need a new purchase of tickets be these flts are all messed up with weather. And
       i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pls let
       linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
       fairbanks.

        Your connection will be 30 minutes - enough time to make flight. If you change, not arrive
        til 2 am
