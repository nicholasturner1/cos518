          Yes, having LAW available to help answer questions tomorrow would be great. 1pm in my conf
          room.

           Suffice it to say, I "don't get it" when I read of Whittaker's letter in the press.

          May I cc Tom/Marty team so they know your take on this?

             Thanks Tom, I agree completely with the sentiment. This is a big deal
             for Alaska, and we need to make sure we launch it correctly. Our
             strength has always been our candid internal discussions ; challenging
             each other to make what's good even better.
             I'm also coming in late to this exchange, but would like to add a little

             I am late 'getting into this discussion but some thoughts for the friends
             I am absolutely proud to be with . I think the collective we are doing
             great. We have been through a really tough time and all of us have been
             personally attacked for doing what is right . That is stressful. Seems
             like this has taken an eternity , yet we are soooo close to the goal.

            I have had the opportunity to hear and be part of the proposal being
            developed for Monday Prjvile ed o Our success has been to
            question, argue and        en ouuse ves or the next round of questions.
            Let's keep it up . Better in house than outhouse.

            I hope you have a special July 4th. As we celebrate our country's
            freedom, I think in our own way we are now fighting for our state's
            freedom. God bless you all. Tom

            Ok, got it. I appreciate your take on this and I sincerely appreciate
            all your hard work on this, and AGIA . It was interesting to watch
            Stevens the other day though in our presser as he rolled out his "energy
            plan" with caveats left and right explaining these were "ideas,
            proposals... needed to be fleshed out in DC, etc," obviously having
            learned not to get himself in a box with some solid PLAN that he'd later
            perhaps have to amend. We've rolled out things/timelines before that we
            later had to amend, so with this Enstar plan I'd like Privileged or

            Here is what I believe to be the "final" concept paper for the "In-State
            Gas" Conference on Monday. This paper has the blessing of both ANGDA
            and ENSTAR and this is the concept we are all working off. And,
            hopefully, their comments will be pegged off it as well. The following
            people will be at the press event , although other representatives from
            the entities may show-up:



            ENSTAR:

             I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for
              1:00pm on Monday, July 7th, in your Anchorage Conference Room. They
             have also been advised that you will be announcing this formation of a
             project development venture (a public/private partnership) and will be
             laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and.
             Harold Heinze making brief statements . I have asked everyone to be at
             your offices about 15 minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into
             the Conference Room together.



             I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you,
             Governor. Should you wish anything else, please let me know. My cell
             phone #: 317-4728.



             Also, we have identified a series of people to pre-message this
             announcement to and we will be making those calls on Sunday evening and
             early Monday.



            Thanks for all your support , Governor, and for your recognition that
            dealing with in-state gas needs is critical ! It was a great insight
            that I believe will push the AGIA License over the edge!
