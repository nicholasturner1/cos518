             Governor:

             I met with the Commission about its budget and pointed out what Rachael says below: The
             Executive Director should have included money for training in the fiscal note for HB 109 -
             the ethics legislation.  The December 10-12 APOC meeting, I'll be in ANC to meet with them
             again about their budget and to go over the efiling project.

             The following adn.com article was sent by:

            And rachael had this to say:



             they'd have training money had they added it to their fiscal

             note...

             A new state law that makes lobbyists

             take ethics training is being carried out partly on the honor

             system.



             Lobbyists who want to register to influence state politicians

             and decision -makers can choose to take the new ethics course

             online. There is no test.




             Lobbyists simply print out a form promising they clicked

             through the roughly hourlong presentation , sign it and send

             it in.

                 Dear Governor Palin,

                 I am writing this letter in support of the University of Alaska request for funding for
                 developing a new Bachelor of Arts in Fisheries program. The development of this
                 program is critical for an industry that needs to continue to develop and build for the
                 future. As a production manager and a person that has been involved in the fishing and
                 seafood processing industry since 1980 I am concerned that there is not enough people
                 that are trained to continue in the business. This program will help prepare our younger
                 generations to understand and work with our resources in the state as well as move the
                 industry forward.

                 As the largest employer in the state the seafood industry needs to be able to work hand
                 in hand with the University to develop students that will become stewards of the
                 resources as well as champions of the industry.

                 In closing I am hopeful that you will support the funding needed by the university as it
                 will return many fold the investment that we make in our future.

                 Sincerely,


                 Donald W. Graves
