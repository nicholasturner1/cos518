  Tod,

  I'd like to nominate you for this. Are you interested?       Can you be available for this?

  This is an exciting program - like one big giant science/business fair.       People come up
  with some great ideas.

  Thanks,

  Rhonda

  Rhonda:
  Are you interested in being an Assessor for the Alaska Marketplace on September 8? We are
  still seeking about 10 Assessors. Please find the attached "Request for Assessors and Technical
  Assistance" form. We need your assistance in forwarding this on and in recommending
  individuals who would be able to serve as an Assessor and to provide technical assistance to
  interested Alaska Marketplace applicants and to the finalists. The Assessors meeting will be on
  September 8 from 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. at the Hawthorn Suites on 9th Avenue. We are hoping
  to identify individuals with expertise in each of the five sub-themes areas (Affordable Energy,
  Practical Use of New Technology, Innovative Ideas to Reduce the Cost of Living, Investing in
  People, and Rural Housing of the Future). Thank you in advance in either submitting your name
  for consideration or forwarding this request on and/or recommending potential individuals.
   Thanks Rhonda we look forward to your participation.
