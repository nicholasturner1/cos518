             Thanks. And I love the team, bless their hearts, but my take on getting the msg out there
             and setting the record straight - well, I'm more anxious to speak to Alaskans, more
             speedily than the team seems to be.

            Two different releases. Eni already went out. Conoco's release with

            everyone's edits is coming your way shortly. I am getting the vibe that

            the gasline team is a little leery about the Conoco release. It is

            coming your way shortly.

            Should have clarified - a presser responding to CP's continued claim of

            my refusal to talk... and Bowles' claim that I just don't understand

            what it takes. Did that response statement go out?

           Sharon- were you helped with any specific edits in presser, and has it

           gone out? Thanks. ( I saw some email chains suggesting points to make,

           but don't know if there was conclusion on the presser's content.)

            I agree that with ENI we have an opportunity to throw cold water on the

            "ACES makes for a bad investment climate" story-angle .           Even the BP

            story was a weak attempted strike at us. As reported , BP is spending

            more than last year , but they say they " might" have spent even more

            without ACES .    Juxtaposing that with a definite $ 1.4B commitment looks

            real good.

            I'm not suggesting we reference BP in our presser , but the timing is

            fortunate.

             All,     Joe has the following good suggestions re: ENI presser:



               It seems pretty clear to me that we need to better inform the writers

             out there that the royalty relief is tailored to kick in at lower prices

             and profits .        Its not just a blanket relief.

             Thx,

            Marty

            Nan, Bruce , Joe would one of you help Sharon craft a good news press

            release on ENI .         Please communicate with each other who is the original

            drafter and who will review .             For facts ENI announced in their own press

            and it was also covered in Petroleum News .                   Needs comments that Ak

            because of reserve potential,             safety , etc is great place and ENI is

            confirming that.          Marty,    Pat and I are just leaving Seattle so we will

            be out of touch for a few hours .             Thanks for the help. Tom

           Governor, I sent you an email yesterday about ENI publicly announcing

           they sanctioned their project.           $1.45 Billion expenditure, 70 wells,

           half for production, 180 million bbl field, and they will build their

           own processing facilities for 40,000 bbls per day. First oil in 2009.

           Nan, Frank and Sharon are working on a press release. Sorry the info

           didn't get to you yesterday. Tom
                                                                5

            On another speech related note--the ADN has an article about how BP has

            reduced its spending plan for Alaska , will ENI's announcement come soon?

            I've only heard it's in the works, not when they'll make it. (Obviously,

            I won't talk about it in the FAI Chamber speech unless it's announced.)
