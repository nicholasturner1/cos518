           Frank Bailey just donated four boxes of brownie mix for the visiting football team's quick
           peek at the mansion Friday night. I will bake them myself... so, no more controversy, it's
           clear the state isn't paying for the students' treat.



          I was reminded that in a couple of months we'll again be hosting thousands of Juneau
          residents and offering them treats at the Mansion's December community event - hopefully
          we won't have to go through the "state can't pay for the food" controversy that this issue
          erupted in yesterday. That was a nonsensicle issue to have to spend so much time on. Frank
          solved it by donating the mixes himself.




          Erika is working with the Juneau coaches (her boys play for JDHS) and we'll have a dinner
          for the team when it's convenient for them. Donated food, or using up some of the
          mansion's inventory, should help cover costs of their visit.



          State staff will not have tc welcome, nor tour (nor straighten up the home afterwards) the
          students through the mansion. on Friday, so it can be noted for those concerned about this
          issue that state resources are not going towards showing hospitality to a visiting group
          of kids.



          Thanks
