             MESSAGE:

             I received an Email, from a friend, regarding your wonderful stand on having your son, and
             your stand against abortion. You hit the mark when you asked for anyone that criticizes
             you about having a downs syndrome baby to look around at everyone else. Good for you. I
             have two good friends, a generation older than I who both have wonderful daughters, one
             apiece, that are the most loving, happy young women one could ever meet. And both were
             born with downs syndrome. These young women now live in a house with a counselor. They
             work full time and attend church. They are enjoying a full life. Not once did my friends
             think of having an abortion.

             Please continue your positive example for all women and men, too.

             I keep informed about Alaska as I my aunt lived in Tok, and my best friend's son is a
             fisherman out of Anchorage.

             God bless you:

             From a fan in Los Angeles, Georgiann C. K. Young.
