           Governor -




           Per Sharon - I have added on your calendar for tomorrow the in-person Interview w/New
           Yorker Magazine - Philip Gourevitch.  He is flying into JNU this evening. I have put on
           calendar - Friday, 08.15.08 at 1:00 p.m. He is very flexible though if this time does not
           work for you.




          Also, I just received an email from Commissioner Irwin in regards to setting up a 20
          minute phone call with him and you regarding Measure 4 and Permitting. He is available on
          Friday, 08.15.08 for this call. Thank you, Janice
