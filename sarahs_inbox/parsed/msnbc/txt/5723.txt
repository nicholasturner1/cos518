             Commissioner,

             It appears as though one of my emails didn't make it to you - it would be great if you could
             be present during Thursday's interview. With your presence there and the topic at-hand, I'd
             also like to extend an invitation for a fish interview with Wesley Loy at ADN (since he asked
             last December / January / and February for the same opportunity). That call could
             immediately follow. Ben needs 15-20 minutes - we could give Wesley the same. The
             window is from 1pm to 2pm right now - so both could comfortably fit within that time
             frame.

             Assuming that you both were able to tackle some of the topics below during yesterday's
             meeting, if you could be at the Governor's office 10-15 minutes ahead, that would be great.
             If you were unable to discuss the questions below, then I'd suggest adequate time to
             discuss the questions - perhaps an hour before?

             Thank you,
             Meghan

            Meghan:

            I haven't yet changed my travel arrangements to Anchorage/Kodiak for this Thursday, but I will if you and
            the Governor would like me present before/during the fish interviews on Thursday. If so, what time should
            I come up?

            DL.
