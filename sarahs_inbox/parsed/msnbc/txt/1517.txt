  Although there are a number of details to work out (which only Foundation members can address), here's
  a link to the draft webpage selling "Friend's of the Governor's Mansion Foundation" that's ready for
  testing.
  http://gov.state.ak.us/house/gmf fundraisinQ.php

  Erika - I need you to find someone to submit a test order, revise paragraph at the top of the page, rewrite
  the descriptions for the merchandise, etc. (general review of the above link)

  We can have this working and ready to mention at the Saturday event if you have time to review.

  Thanks-
