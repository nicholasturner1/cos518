            Please pass on to Governor Palin that we were so blessed &               honored that she chose to spend
            time with us on yesterday for such a momentous occasion as                Dr. King's birthday. Her
            comments were awesome & she brings such a beautiful spirit                to any room she enters. The
            celebration would have incomplete without her being there.                  Please pass on to her that we
            pray much for her & her family as she continues the journey              of leading this great state.




            Multiple blessings,
