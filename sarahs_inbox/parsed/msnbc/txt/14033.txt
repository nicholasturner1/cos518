             Please don't shoot the messenger... Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

            Privile ed or Personal Material Redacted
            Privileged d     I know it's difficult, but just wanted to at least bring up

             the idea (and at present, I'm out of reach of a smack to the head).

             I'll wait to hear from Mike about what he'd like me to do.

             Mike will be contacting you re: the assistance needed as Stedman has put

             a stop to all Governor's bills, and you saw what Senate leadership did

             to the budget yesterday - actions that negatively affect your budgets,

             our agenda to move this state forward, etc. We do need your assistance

            here to have restored those things that will allow you all to do your

             jobs for Alaskans. Thank you.
