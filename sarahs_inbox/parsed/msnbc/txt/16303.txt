              Mrs. Palin,




              You are impressive.  How come you are not hawking McCain for the VP spot. You would be
              the most assurable choice instead of Pawlanty or any other person out there. It would
              insure a proper voter strategy and keep the new Republican movement afloat.




              Just thought I'd drop you thought from a Texan.




              Have a Wonderful Day,




                                                                   I




                                                                                                              PRA_GSP01_0019756
