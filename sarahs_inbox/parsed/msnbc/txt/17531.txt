        Sorry, but we don't have his pants here!



        The story is that Charles Lindbergh was a guest at the House and needed his pants ironed,
        so he asked Mrs . Hickel if the housekeeper/staff would press them. She ironed them
        herself; since she was too embarrassed to let him know that she didn't have a housekeeper.
        My understanding is that he took his pants with him... :)

        I know it sounds a bit far-fetched but I am concerned about the status of Charles
        Lindbergh's Pants. I

        know, I know, there are many more pressing issues, but if I remember correctly, they are
                                                                1

        kept in the

        Governor ' s Mansion ,   and aired and ironed periodically .     I remember the last time the media
        reported on the

        condition of the pants was during the Hickel administration. I am not sure, but I believe
        they are

        khakis. Please don't spend any of your time on this but if you can delegate it, I would
        sleep a little

        easier.



       Many thanks,
