                Mike,
                We heard Rep. Guttenberg is trying to file a bill by Monday (personal bill deadline) related to
                merit/needs based scholarships . I called Rep. Guttenberg and asked whether he might be
                open to jointly filing it with a Republican who had expressed interest . He said he was so I'm
                working to put Rep. Wes Keller together with him on this project . (Wes had told me that he was
                very supportive of merit scholarships and I'm hoping he can provide a more conservative
                balance to what Guttenberg wants to do.)

                Rep. Meyer had already expressed interest in funding such an effort in stages so this might all
                dovetail into a House led effort. Just wanted you to have the heads up this is percolating in the
                background.
