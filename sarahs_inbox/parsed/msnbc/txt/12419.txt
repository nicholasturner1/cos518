              He's doing this like he did with holding up SB80 last year - it's political - it's to get
              us to have to strike deals with leggies on capital budget items , and we're not playing
              those games , so we 'll cont to reiterate our committment to the budget we initally rolled
              out that included corrosion issue litigation . And PSIO positions.

              Dear Governor Palin,      Heard you on the radio talking about resource

              development in DC, nice coverage.



                       Rep. Chenault's elimination of the BP corrosion case funds is not

              final.     He said he would have the whole committee consider it. It is

             actually quite a commitment.         We fully expect that it will be about five

             million a year for five years and the legislators are understandably

             careful about it.      On the other hand it will involve a claim for

             hundreds of millions of dollars. So, I don't really think Chenault

             thought he had killed the appropriation, I think he may just want more

             discussion.     At least I hope so.       Talis

             Sharon- I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault's taking out PSIO

             positions and BP corrosion lawsuit funds out of my budget. im back here

             in DC speaking with Cneney ( sat with him the entire State dinner last

             night), will try to speak w /Bush today... speaking with national

             reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can

             provide sound oversight of resource development, as evidenced by PSIO,

             lawsuits to hold industry's feet to the fire re: waste of valuable

             natural resources, etc... and here while I'm away I find out the

             legislature may undermine those efforts ?      It's unacceptable if the

             nation is to believe we're capable of responsible, ethcial ramped up

             development that's need in our state, for our nation.
