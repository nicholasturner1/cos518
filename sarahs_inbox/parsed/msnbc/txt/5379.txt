                 Subject: Track's travel
                 Linda, what are the rules about Track Plain traveling to Juneau? Since he hasn't been to Juneau yet,
                 does he get to come and see his family's home in Juneau on a state TA, or does he have to move here?
                 Please advise, I think he's coming down on Monday and we need to figure out his travel. Thanks! Kari.
