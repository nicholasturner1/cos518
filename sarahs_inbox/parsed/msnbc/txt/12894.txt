             Ok. Hopefully the other pubs will pick up. Pls submit to any others, incl Peninsula
             Clarion and the smaller rural papers also. And Eagle River Star. Thanks

             Zencey passed - see below . I sent it to the Empire , Frontiersman and Ketchikan Daily News
             so far . Ketchikan has indicated they will run it.



             Sharon,

               I've taken another look at this, and I'm going to pass. I don't see a lot in there that
             adds to the coverage we've had of the earmark controversy (though it is a concise summary
             that covers multiple articles worth of information).



             My decision might be different if the governor were the author and she hadn't had one in
             the past 30 days, but ... not under John' s name , and not within 2 weeks of her last one.



             Matt

            "I believe it's inappropriate to stuff a supplemental budget with a package of last year's
            vetoed capital projects , especially when the adminstration has not even seen the growing
            list of legislator ' s projects they ' ve apparently now added to the supplemental budget.
            Supplemental budgets traditionally , and appropriately , fund end - of-year shortfalls due to
            unexpected costs , usually in operations of public services provided by government. The
            capital budget should be developed in a comprehensive manner."

            Rep. Meyer told Bill McAllister that the budget has / will be moved out with the capital
            projects IN.  BM wants comment from the administration . Please advise.
