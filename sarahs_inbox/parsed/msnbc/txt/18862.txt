          WASHINGTON , D.C. - Senator Murkowski today issued the following statement regarding the
          State's decision to shutdown the Gravina Island bridge project:




          "The community of Ketchikan has made safe and reliable access to the airport a priority
          for over 30 years. When the State of Alaska requested resources to build a bridge, the
          Congressional Delegation worked hard to secure funding.



          It is unfortunate for the people of Ketchikan that the State has chosen to reprioritize
          its support of this project.




         I look forward to working with the State to provide the people of Ketchikan an opportunity
         for economic growth and safe and efficient access to their airport."
