                Anna - we should think about writing an op-ed re : Health Care Council and the great work
               it has done ... the ADN ' s editorial takes a swipe at their efforts this morning - but at
               least admitted we're doing something vs waiting for the Feds to fix problems . ^ e_ged o

               Kris,




               I will be in Anchorage again Monday Dec 10 at the Sheraton again to attend the Supportive
              Housing Summit . It is from 8 am to 3 pm or so .   Do you want me to extend a day or so and
              spend some time with you and / or the Governor ? Let me know.



               If that week doesn ' t work out , let me know when and even how often you would like me to
              come to Anchorage and I will be there .    I don ' t mind coming to Anchorage!



               Anna
