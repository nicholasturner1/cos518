        Greetings,



        The September 2007 issue of Steve Jones' Chancellor's Report

        highlighting recent achievements and developments at UAF is now

        available for your review at

        http://www.uaf.edu/chancellor/report/index.html. The report is

        published five times a year and is included in the informational

        packets at each regular meeting of the UA Board of Regents.



        If you have any trouble accessing these files, or would prefer a hard

        Sincerely,



        Ann Ringstad, Associate Vice Chancellor
