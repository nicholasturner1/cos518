                The Wolf carcass was tested last night and came back positive. F&G is working with health officials in the YK
                area. This advisory release went out last night from F&G.

                Hi Mike,

                Just wanted to be sure you heard about this and passed the word to the appropriate folks at the OOG. People
                get a little jumpy when they hear the word "rabies," and rightly so. Holler if you have any questions (cell: 321-
                4528). We're steering inquiries to a couple of level-headed PlOs, Cathie Harms (ADF&G) and Greg Wilkinson
                (DHSS), and State Veterinarian Bob Gerlach (DEC) is prepared to talk to callers if need be. I'd like to to hear
                about it if anyone contacts your office about this.
