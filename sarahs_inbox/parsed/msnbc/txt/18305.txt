         Thanks - and I'm surprised they told Sean they don't feel they've been heard and/or
         there's no resolution in sight. I know they didn't like the state's answers, but sounds
         like they forgot to mention to Sean that we've heard them on this numerous times.



         Maybe they've now got an innovative idea towards resolution they want to propose?

        Thanks - I've met with this group on this issue at least once already, then with Mulva and
        Bowles on it - seems the issue has been rehashed many times and still no progress - I need
        to hear the latest from Marty on it.

        Kris has also been a part of meeting(s) with this crew on the same issue.

         Just got done with a meeting with Mayor John Williams, Tim Navarre, Bruce Richards. (The
         Mayor had departed before they hit me with the LNG issue.) Because of the intensity of the
         concerns over the state position and because they think can provide a legit government to,
         government alternative, I'm going to recommend you see if there are 15 minutes you can
         spare while you're here in Kenai for industry appreciation days. Listening to them will go
         a long ways to calming down the concerns. (They felt blindsided by the state's position on
         export license and still don't feel like they've been heard--they've heard from Marty and
         Tom--no resolution possible there, in KPB's mind.) Just a heads up with recommendation.
