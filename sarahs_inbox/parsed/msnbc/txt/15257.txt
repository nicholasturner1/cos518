          MESSAGE:

          Governor:



          I just wanted to send a couple of words, a line, a verse to let you know that you have my
          vote whether you run for Governor again, or you run for Vice-President of the United
          States.   I never lie.  That's the truth.  Best of luck to you. Thank you for your
          decisions.   Blessings on you, your son, and yes, blessings on the MatSu as well... smile.



          Thanks so much for the energy thing.
