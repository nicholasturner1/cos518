             Importance: High

             The Alaska PTA would like to invite Gov. Sara to be a speaker at the annual legislative
             conference being held in Anchorage (school to be determined, probably Hanshew)
            November 9th from 6pm to 9pm.
            This is one of two conferences we host annually for PTA members specifically to set our
            legislative priorities for the upcoming legislative session. Friday evening will be speakers
            and presentations and then on Saturday the delegates will listen to content experts and
            then set the wording of a priority through a parliamentary process. The Alaska PTA
            Board of Managers represent 9000 members from al I parts of the state and wi II use this
            grassroots work to speak out on behalf of all Alaskan Students.
            Scheduled for Friday night speakers for right now are: Sen Murkowski (who once served
            Gov't Hill Elementary as PTA President), Rep Roses will address the results of the special
            education task force, Michael Pawlowski (Rep Meyer's office) will give an over view of the
            legislature and how a bill works it way through both houses and I am still looking for a
            Senate speaker as Senator Davis will be returning from Seattle.
            I have attached last year's priorities for reference. No doubt, education funding will still
            be at the top of concerns as will the Public Schools Lands Trust and we believe that
            concern about the states graduation rate and skills training available for all students will
