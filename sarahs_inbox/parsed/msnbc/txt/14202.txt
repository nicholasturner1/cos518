            Don't feel bad about this at all. Russ- if you and your family are feeling led to broaden
            your horizons, take on new challenges, and go through an open door that is there before
            you, then you are wise to seek confirmation on this and, then,.to grab it!



            You and Ellen are at a cool point in life where you're seeing new chapters unfold. If
            working together in DC for Alaska's benefit is appealing to you, I support you and it can
            be a very good thing for you and our state.



            Thank you!

            Governor,



            I'm sorry for the mix-up. The D.C. discussion was supposed to occur after session. I was
            going to ask your permission, once the dust had settled.-next week.




            I apologize for not having brought it up before you heard from John. That was not my
            intention and I feel badly about it.




            Russ
