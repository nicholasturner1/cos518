            FYI before the MEA meeting on Saturday.

            I have talked to Tuckerman Babcock and Lorilei Carter regarding the Railbelt Energy Fund (which was vetoed last
            year).
            They wanted to let the Governor know that MEA (and Homer Electric Association ) is happy with the distribution
            proposal made last year, felt that it was fair , and would be happy to have that same distribution this year.
