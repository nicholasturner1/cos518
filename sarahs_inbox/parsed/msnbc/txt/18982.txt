         Subject:                  Re: 'Fix it first' won 't help Alaska's road system (by the DOT Commissioner)


         Leo,

         I do agree that states need to set appropriate priorities for their

         transportation needs. But that said, I think we as a State have had some

         skewed priorities lately and it is time we adjusted them. To address the

         points raised in your "Fix it First Won't Help" piece I would like to

         make the following observations:



         1. We don't live in an average sized state, we live in the largest

         state. By far, by twice, any way you want to figure it. Many of the

         communities in this state exist not because there was any kind of

         economic reason for them in the first place but because they were

         locales that humans could survive in. Period. Survival and economic

         prosperity are two radically different paths. Couple the extraordinarily

         difficult building conditions with the same magnitude of distance and

         traditional transportation projects become completely impractical. Water

         or aviation based means, while expensive, become the most viable

         solution. I'm sorry, Hooper Bay will never have road access to Anchorage.

         If unlimited funding were a reality we could pursue any project that

         came to mind. But funding is limited so we have to make decisions based

         on getting the maximum benefit for those dollars. A Ketchikan bridge, a

         "road" to Juneau and even a Knik arm crossing fail those benefit

         metrics, in that order. I would personally benefit quite nicely from a

         Knik arm crossing as it would give me much faster, shorter access times

         to a family cabin and recreation site in the Mat Su. I still cannot,

        with a reasonable conscience, endorse it given the other, more pressing

        needs I see when I look and travel around Alaska. Access to our cabin

         involves either hiking, flying or snowmachining and for considerably

                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA_GSP01_0005530

          longer than the 15 minute ferry trip in Ketchikan .          Yet I will put up

          with it and fore go lobbying for the planned road past our lake and

          instead , press for a missing link in Anchorage that would benefit

          thousands more in the form of reduced travel time ,          congestion, air

          quality and fuel savings.



          2. While a novel concept ,       I think the notion that there was much in line

          of fuel taxes paid out from the 1916 time frame amounted to much.

          Especially if compared to what the area and contributions of the

          Eisenhower network probably paid in. And we did get transportation

          projects done - the Alaska Highway being one of the most prominent as an

          example . And I recall from my days at Northway prior to Statehood that

          the BPR took care of that highway at US taxpayer expense . As of a few

          years ago there were still file cabinets in today ' s Northway DOT office

          with the BPR decals on them.



          3.   If we already , as even you write ,   spend the lions share of our

          transportation dollars on maintenance how on earth are we to dream of

          maintaining even more as yet unbuilt infrastructure ? If it can be shown

          that maintenance funding is assured, I will endorse building anything

          that can also be funded . But to build without any kind of assured

          maintenance funding is to build just to fund the dreams and aspirations

          of those that have a part in getting something built , not being

          responsible stewards of public funds ,      goals , needs and trust. I saw

          first hand this process in action while employed at the State as a

          communications tech. Sites that cost millions to build were crumbling

          for lack of maintenance funding while new ones were being contemplated

         and worse , built to start the cycle yet again.



          So yes, let' s make sure Fix It is an integral, viable part of our

         transportation infrastructure before it gets built.
