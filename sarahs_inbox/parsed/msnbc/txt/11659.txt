              May I see the list of positions/person in SU - and is their message then that the 2000
              employees WILL strike certain at some drop-dead date?

             This is the APEA-SU ad asking Governor Palin to intervene in SU

             negotiations and to take the arbitrator's ruling sight unseen. It is

             running in the ADN and the JNU Empire. Not sure if it's in FBX as well.

             This ad gives us until February 1 to accept the "offer".
