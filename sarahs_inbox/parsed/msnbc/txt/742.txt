 Todd - Wanted to make sure that this is an old friend of the Governor's before I forward on.

 Also, we are checking into moving the State of the State address up to 5:30 p.m. that way you could all
 head to the airport by 6:45/7:00 p.m. at the latest. The last flight out to Seattle is @ 8:05 p.m. There
 should not be a problem with that. The only concern with the earlier speech is that it is televised and we
 want to make sure folks are home and able to watch.

 I will let Erika know that you will be attending the Fish Summit. Thanks, Janice

 Governor,

 Can you spare a few minutes for an old friend. I am hoping to get your thoughts on the future and any plans I can
 help you achieve.

 If you have any time for me,

  Good afternoon! I am inviting all Alaskans to become involved in the state budget
  process by participating in a web survey.

  Voices Across Alaska: State Budget Priorities is an opportunity for all Alaskans to
  provide your opinion on how the state's projected budget surplus should be
  saved and invested.

  We all know oil prices will not remain at record levels forever, and planning
  ahead will help ensure that we really are kicking off a new era of tax stability.
  Under ACES, surplus revenue of approximately $1.6 billion could be realized this
  year.

  I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to become part of the process.

  We will use your input to complete the FY2009 budget plan, which will be
  released to the public and the Legislature for consideration in mid-December.

  Surveys will be accepted through 5 p . m. on December 3, 2007.

  The survey can be accessed at www.alaska.qov or www.gov.state.ak.us.




                                                                       ROSTON 01176
