           We need to get the word out on our intent to sue before we release AGIA findings this
          week. Our pro-development folks who'll criticize AGIA will at least then have something to
          unite with us on... so let's get that presser out tomorrow.



           Alaskans in general will be anxious to hear what the plan is to protect this state.
