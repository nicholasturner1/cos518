            I don't know if we're going to be ready for an afternoon press availabity. We still don't
            know what we're going to do with the vetoes, I still don't know what all is in the budget,
            we still don't know what battles we'd be wise to pick- how will this all be figured out in
            the next couple of hours? And I have a 1.5 hr lunch with Lisa in between???
