             Mike- were due for a cabinet mtg, even if I can only participate via phone. Kris can help
             organize from the Anchorage end. Pls let her know best day/time for this, sooner the
             better. Main topic must be budget (as usual) as the veto process could/should begin soon:
             Also, support for Joe will be a highlight.
