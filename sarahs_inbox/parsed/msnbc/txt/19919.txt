          Yes we do need to answer them. And with a subtle reminder of Knowles' support for merger
          those years ago should help put his opinion in perspective.

          Governor,



           On monday afternoon, the senate energy committee is going to hear from governors Hickel
          and Knowles at 2:00. We are familiar with their respective messages : vote no on AGIA
          (albeit for different reasons).

                 Subject: Wooten - question

                 Sharon: The past several days we have been going through all the materials in the Wooten investigative files. We came across something in the 9114105
                 interview of Wooten by Trooper Wall that we want to ask the governor about

                 On page 11 of that transcript, when Wooten is being questioned about the moose hunting incident, Wooten asserts that Chuck Heath had said he would use
                 Molly's moose tag to take a moose if she didn't do it herself.

                 Wall presses Wooten on that point

                 Wooten: ...he was going to take her tag and go fill her tag . With our without ah regardless of whether she went or not he was gonna go shoot a
                 moose. Period.

                 Wall: Did he tell that to MOLLY or you?

                 Wooten: Me. And MOLLY was there too she heard it He does it every year . He does it with SALLY 'S caribou tag. SARAH'S caribou tag an...

                 The union representative interjects at that point and they don 't come back to it

                 It's my understanding that Gov. Palin received several Neichina Tier II permits . Did Chuck Heath ever take caribou using one or more of her permits, as
                 Trooper Wooten seems to be saying here to the investigator? To the governors knowledge, did Mr. Heath use Sally's permits as described by Wooten? To
                 her knowledge, did he take moose or caribou on Molly 's permits, as Wooten is saying? Am I misreading what Wooten is saying here?

                 I'm attaching the page of the transcript in question.

             Thanks.
