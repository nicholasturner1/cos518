              Governor - I did get word this evening that the King Air is now having navigational problems and will not be back
              up to Alaska until sometime in September. We are going to have to use the DPS aircraft where we can and look into
              leasing into the other areas. Janice

              Kelly- this is assuming you'd NEED and/or want to be there for the ceremonial bill signing . If not, we can swing it
              without you. We have wanted to use the event to honor AK women, especially.
               Joe- gotta kill a few birds with one stone on my trip up there, so if I could meet with miners, state employees,
              whomever needs a visit.- I'm happy to do it on this Fairbanks trip.
                Janice- any chance the King Air would be available? Thanks, all.

              Since I'll be in Nenana on Friday for the bridge ceremonial bill signing, I can get up there the day before to meet
              with Mayor Whittaker on his energy issues.
                Possibility in getting out there to meet with Bernie (at Chena) to hear his geothermal ideas too, during-this
              Fairbanks visit.
                Remember part of the purpose for the Nenana event is to honor AK Native women w/naming the bridge... so
              besides Britta and Kelly staffing me for that (and Joe needs to get to Fairbanks so we can talk energy, too), I would
              think Rhonda and/or Tara Jollie would want to participate? And if Kris wants to staff up there, then great... If not,
              that's cool too.
