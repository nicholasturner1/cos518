          Dear Mr. Johannes:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control , manage our revenues and resources efficiently , and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

          receiving end of one of the cuts, I am glad that you were willing to do what was right,
          and not what was easy or popular.  Although I hate to see the $200,000 that was allocated
          for the new Valley Sports Complex (AT& T Sports Center) cut, I think many cuts were
          needed. Thank you for working to do what's right for Alaska.
