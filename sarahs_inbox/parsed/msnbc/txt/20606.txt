          Hi Bill- thanks for attending the luncheon today!

             Also, I spoke with Marion Ramano last night at the fair. Interesting that she decided
          to leave the borough and is now looking for a new challenge. I like her enthusiasm. She
          said she spoke to you and will be speaking with you again in the future about possible
          opportunities to serve the state. I told her I'd let you know that we spoke - we have a
          good relationship over 25-plus years.
