  Representative Edgmon,

  I spoke with Frank yesterday and he said you had a possible board candidate from Chignik
  in mind. Could you send me their name and contact information (email and/or phone) and
  I'd be happy to touch base with him or her. Also, if you could provide a few sentences of
  background information on this person, I'll refine the list of boards I discuss with them to fit
  their expertise.

  Thank you for your time and consideration.
