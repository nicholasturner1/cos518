          Our message today needs to be: I expect that open, transparent, healthy debate that "I
          KNOW" is going on inside the Senate to be -finally - allowed to see the light of day. Does
          Hollis or Lyda have a gag order on their coalation members? Take his words, turn them
          around and ask that members be allowed to open closed doors and debate - as he's insisting
          we're not allowing in the admin.



          Sharon can help me get that msg out today, as I can't avoid reporters on a busy day like
          today.

         Why aren't we highlighting this as the split-causer in Lyda's coalition? They dont agree
         on oil taxes, we're in the middle and we're "to blame"... The two of them should be
         shooting at each other instead of us remaining in the middle getting shot. I'm trying to
         get us out of the way and deal with ACES on it's merits.



         But I cant do this without messaging opportunities being ignored. i wish i had more hours
         in the day...

          Still trying to sit down with it- I have to today in between mtgs.



           Pls be thinking how to message back to Hollis who is insisting he knows there                is internal
          dissent on ACES . Part of the response is: he needs to provide specifics as his               allegations
          are political and unfair unless he names names so I can deal with this issue -                 if there is
          an issue . If there isnt he needs to quit stirring up doubts and just deal with                ACES on its
          merits . There is no gag order and I hope staff will publicly debate this.



          I hate the politics in this, as ACES is too imp to be messing around with and I don't
         want anyone holding back if they have disagreements with the proposal.



          But please dont let anyone talk you into just letting this slide , and go unanswered. We
         do too much of that and then we have to "react " aggressively and try to unring a bell that
         critics have rung . Let's get on top of this one and I've asked Russ to call Hollis this
         morning, but Hollis has been so public about this the past few days we owe it to the
         public to answer Hollis ' accusations.
