             Dear Governor Palin,

                   Just so you know .  The US Supreme Court just issued an order denying the plaintiffs
             request that our lawyer be allowed to participate in the oral argument before the Court on
             Feb. 27 .  This was relayed to us by the attorney we had hired to do that argument.
              Therefore , our input will be limited to the amicus brief ( you have a copy ). Talis
