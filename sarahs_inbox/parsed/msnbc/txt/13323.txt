            MESSAGE:

            Hello. I did not know exactly where to send this e-mail so I apologize if this is not the
            appropriate place. Congratulations on the birth of your son. Twenty years ago at the age
            of 19 I gave birth to my son Justin with Downs Syndrome. I just had to reach out to you
            and let you know how lucky you are to have him. Yes, I said lucky. We all have hopes and
            dreams for our children, but with a Downs child these plans are just a little different,
            but a lot more satisfying as a parent .As a governor,I'm sure this will open your eyes to
            all the programs in need in our state for people with disabilities. I hope you enjoy your
            special little man as much as I have for the last twenty years. Rebecca M.
