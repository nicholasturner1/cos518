           Could we get fruits, low carb stuff, and small bottles of champagne?

               Pis let me know commissioners availability on all this today. In trying to coordinate over the
               weekend it seemed a wednesday event was possible but I haven't heard back definitively from
               anyone yet. Cabinet could coincide with AGIA and Energy decisions w legislature. Hopefully
               my emails were received:

               Governor,
               The Senate schedule is very uncertain and will not firm up until after the Senate has their caucus meeting on Monday
               morning (@ 11:00am, I'm told). Therefore I think whatever date works for you for your Cabinet meeting will be fine. I do
               want to reiterate the message Tom sent to you last night , that we do need you here in Juneau early next week to start working
               Legislators before the. AGIA vote. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do for you.
               Thanks for checking on the schedule.
               Marty

               Marty: I'd like cabinet members to be down there to support AGIA team, touch base with leggies, etc this week- we can turn
               the visit into a cabinet meeting luncheon. Does Thursday sound good? Or before that?

              J- I forgot- its, wedding day, don't turn that bb on and don't answer emails! :) give Hannah and Jake a hug from the Palins
              today!
                Mike - let's plan cabinet mtg in the form of a luncheon at the house this week, if we can assume enough members can be in
              Juneau. Its a historic week if the AGIA vote is taken, so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that (and in support of AGIA
              team). We can do a bit of an informal lunch whoundtable setting and we'll literally go around the tables getting updates from
              everyone of their dept activities.
