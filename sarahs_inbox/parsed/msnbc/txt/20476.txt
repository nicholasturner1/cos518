          Governor - This is the first that I have heard of this therefore, I just checked with the
          Governor's office computer folks and they went in on Monday, August 4th. They had
          coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the time. They
          unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned
          back to the house. All of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend.
          I was told that the department of law had asked for this. Janice
