           Governor - We will speak with Mayor Whitaker's office on Monday, 04.28 and let them know
           that we will set this up for Tuesday, 04.29 but under the understanding that if you are
           not available the Mayor can meet with Joe Balash.



           Also, we have gone through the database and do not recall an event (native) for tomorrow,
           Saturday, 04.26.  We have not confirmed any event for you to participate in. Janice

           That day- and the coming days- are dependent on this baby's doc appts over the weekend.
           Surely Whitaker and others can understand that there ' s a need for major flexibility for
           awhile . So... I'll try to promise I can meet him that morning right after Greene's
           meeting . I'll try. Also - any of these mtgs that be taken care of over the phone, that is
           obviously easier . As for Whittaker , pls make sure I know what his precise issues are.


                                                                    1

           Governor - Mayor Whitaker , FBKS - has been asking for a meeting with you in regards to the
           gasline . We had thought that you would take a trip up his way soon .  We just received
           another call from the Mayor's office saying that the Mayor will be in Anchorage on
           business on Tuesday , 04.29.08 and would like to see you. He is coming by himself.



           On your calendar for Tuesday , 04.29 . 08 we have blocked 9:15 - 10 : 15 a.m . for appointment.
           11:30 - 12:30 p . m. for the Rev . Dr. Greene meeting . Would there be an appropriate time
           that Mayor Whitaker could see you for approx . 15 minutes during this day. Thanks , Janice
