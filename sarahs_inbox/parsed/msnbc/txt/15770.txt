         Message:Dear Governor Palin, thank you so very much for funding the Alaska Fire Standards
         Council.  I know you had to make many difficult decisions on the budget but this one made
         a tremendous difference... let's keep it funded-in the future too. I support you 100%...I
         have a very nice picture of you and me taken during the Iditarod that means a lot to
         me...As an older new dad I just want to share with you something... enjoy every moment you
         can with your beautiful baby...keep up the great job! Martin Schwan, Anchorage Fire
         Department, Division of Fire Prevention...
