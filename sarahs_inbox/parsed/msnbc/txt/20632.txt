              Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event information for the AFL-CIO convention keynote. Many, many people have
              weighed in on this speech from our office (JNU/ANC), Labor, Admin, and OMB. In the event that I have left to do
              a site walk-through when you emerge from your interview, I will leave your briefing booklet with Britta. Please let
              me know if you have any concerns or questions about the remarks. Thank youl

              Kate Morgan
              Communications Coordinator
              Office of Governor Sarah Palin
