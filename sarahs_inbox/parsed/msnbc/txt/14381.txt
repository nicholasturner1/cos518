               I'll work up fresh new remarks for you, as I delivered the proc and revised remarks on
               your behalf.   The event sponsors gave me some adorable Harley baby things to pass on to
               you and Trig:)

               Kate- thanks so much for the bike blessing info also - I'll use it at next week's event...
               It sounds like it may be a bigger event even than yesterday's bike blessing.
