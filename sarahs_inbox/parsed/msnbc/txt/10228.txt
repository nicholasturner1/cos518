              Done . Thanks. I forwarded emails to Sharon and offered up my office to help if needed--
              asked her to call Jay if any support needed. Sean

             These are great ideas ... I don't know if our Comm folks have thought of Privileged or Person
             they're pretty overloaded with budget and tomorrow's AGIA. If you want to suggest any o
             this to sharon, I know she'd listen and consider it. The next couple of weeks got packed
             real quickly and I won't have time to work with them on this today or tomorrow- feel free
             to give specific input on the idea to her (and Beth) though. Thanks

              As an aside , if you're going to do a character/ethics rollout, the middle school in Kenai
             is the place as they embarked on and continue their character schools initiative in that
             district with a lot of enthusiasm and success.
