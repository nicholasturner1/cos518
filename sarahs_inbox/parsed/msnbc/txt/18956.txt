        It's great to be in Louisiana, a big oil and gas producing state - like Alaskal



        I'm happy to be back with the representatives from so many states here at this meeting of
        the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.



        Some of you may remember that I served as head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation

          Commission . Alaskans recognized the importance of regulation before we even had a viable
          oil and gas industry - AOGCC was created in 1955 - four years before we became a state!



          The work done by IOGCC and the state regulatory bodies ensures oil and natural gas
          resource recovery while protecting our nation ' s health, safety and environment . That is
          our commitment to the nation - so that all Americans will have confidence in our efforts
          to reduce American ' s dependence on foreign oil.



          Alaska will play an increasingly important role in oil and gas production within the
          United States . We've developed only a fraction of our known reserves , and have many times
          this known amount awaiting discovery and commercialization . Out of at least 20 major
          offshore basins and onshore regions with oil and gas potential , only 2 Alaskan basins have
          been under development.



          That's why what we're doing in Alaska is so important to the nation's future. Most
          importantly, we are underway - for the first time in state history - with a viable plan
          toward constructing an Alaska gas pipeline.



         Before we look to the future, let's look back 30 years . On June 20 , 1977 , Alaskan oil
         first began flowing from Prudhoe Bay through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System - or "TAPS"
         - and onward to the nation and the world.



         TAPS was an engineering marvel . The 800-mile - long pipeline is one of the largest pipeline
         systems in the world . It stretches from Prudhoe Bay through three mountain ranges to
         Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in North America . TAPS forever changed the Alaskan
         economy . And more importantly , the energy landscape of the nation . TAPS has transported
         more than 15 billion barrels of oil.




         TAPS has proven to be a huge blessing to the nation . It also has been a challenge - to be
         good stewards of our non - renewable natural resources.



         Alaska is home to one of the most prolific and diverse resource bases in the world. Given
         the blessing of a huge state with plenty of space, we are able to actively develop our
         resources and promote our nation ' s economy while at the same time , ensuring that our
         abundant wildlife and habitat resources are protected for future generations.

         We will continue to work closely with the oil and gas industry to develop new leases, both
         onshore and offshore . For example , new exploration companies are developing three
         outstanding offshore prospects northwest of the Kuparuk River Unit . These companies
         recognize the tremendous value of undeveloped onshore and offshore reserves . The unit
         operators expect to drill this winter , with the expectation of producing tens of millions
         of barrels.

         Alaska produces about 15 percent of the country ' s domestic oil. While TAPS at its peak in
         1988 was pumping 2 million barrels a day through the line , today it moves approximately
         700,000 barrels per day.



         We have successfully unlocked vast resources within our state and are working to do so
         responsibly off its shores. And unlock them we must . We can no longer warehouse Alaska's

         resources - Alaskans can't afford it, Americans can't afford it.

          (pause)

         We learned a lesson with U.S. dependence on foreign oil. We must ensure that we don't walk
         into the same trap with natural gas.

         Developing Alaska ' s North Slope basin will allow access to an abundant supply of natural
         gas, with known reserves of more than 35 trillion cubic feet , or T-C-F, and potential
         reserves of much , much more.

         Building a gas pipeline is critical not just for Alaska's future, it's also an essential
         component of our nation's energy policy. The same foreign powers that control the world's
         oil supply are beginning to control the supply of natural gas. Alaska stands ready and
         able to supply our fellow Americans with an abundant, cheap clean source of energy for the
         future.

         Today Alaska is poised to deliver on a natural gas pipeline. We recently enacted
         legislation that has commenced - for the first time in Alaska history - a competitive
         process for all interested and qualified applicants to step forward and propose the best
         plan, route, economic plan, and timing, to receive Alaska's exclusive license to build the
         line.



         Alaska is taking the unprecedented step of offering $500 million in state matching funds
         to mitigate exposure during the riskiest phase of the project, that period leading up to
         project certification by the either the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or another
         authorized regulatory body.

         Our inducements to those who will build the pipeline are valuable, and will encourage
         companies to compete . For a chance to compete for the inducement package , applicants must
         agree to certain bedrock requirements , such as delineated and enforceable project
         benchmarks and acknowledgement of pipeline rate treatment that allows for affordable
         economic expansion.

         These terms will ensure competitive and long - term exploration and MORE development on
         Alaska's North Slope . The pipeline must be expandable to accommodate the new discoveries
         of any explorers , to ensure that North Slope gas energizes our nation for generations..

         We also offer inducements to those who hold the leases and control the gas, to ensure that
         the current leaseholders commit their gas to the licensed project.

         We are hearing very encouraging comments from potential pipeline applicants, producers, or
         explorers . And the message is clear - they want to do business in Alaska!

         (pause)



        We've been talking about Alaskan resource development . But let ' s examine WHY this so
        important to our nation. Why is it so important to YOU.



        FIRST , development and commercialization of domestic energy sources will provide
        substantial and immediate consumer impact in the United States.



        The introduction of a considerable volume of incremental supply to the North American
        market will provide BILLIONS of dollars in energy cost savings to American homes and
        businesses . It is estimated that a 4.5 billion cubic foot Alaskan gas pipeline could save
        Americans $100 BILLION over the first five years of the project.

         SECOND, Alaska's gas will enhance national security by easing America's dependence on
         energy sourced from unstable regions of the world.



         America's dependence on foreign oil is well-known. Oil-rich governments possess great
         global leverage given their ability to threaten a cutoff of supplies. Our dependence on
         foreign oil also forces ' a transfer hundreds of billions of dollars annually to
         unaccountable regimes, which often pose security risks to the U.S. And, as finite oil
         reserves dwindle, those still heavily reliant upon it will be drawn into conflict.



         The problem is not limited to oil. America is becoming dependent on foreign sources of
         natural gas, much of it from the Middle East. The same region of the world that has
         provided much of our oil supply is now increasing its natural gas production. Let's be
         clear - development of Alaska's natural gas is a vital national interest.



         THIRD, the project will be environmentally-friendly. A natural gas pipeline can easily use
         many existing oil pipeline corridors, infrastructure and roads. This reduces environmental
         impacts by minimizing the footprint. Moreover, while renewables are an increasingly
         important part of our supply, the reality is that our nation will continue to need fossil
         fuels as part of its energy portfolio for years to come. Natural gas is the cleanest of
         all fossil fuels, and will help bridge our nation's transition to increased reliance on
         renewable energy sources.



          (pause)



         Climate change will affect how we produce oil and gas in Alaska. Last week I created
         Alaska's first sub-cabinet to prepare a climate change strategy for the state. There is no
         doubt that Alaska's climate is changing. And we are already seeing the effects -- coastal
         erosion, thawing permafrost, retreating sea ice and record forest fires that affect our
         communities and our infrastructure.



         Scientists tell us to expect many more changes in the near future. These are changes we
         must prepare for now, as they will also affect our ability to access our non-renewable
         resources. And to ensure that we diversify our energy future, my administration's Climate
         Change Sub-Cabinet will be looking at ways to develop, promote and expand renewable energy
         resources such as geothermal, wind, hydroelectric, tidal and in-stream energy.



         (pause)



        Alaska stands ready to provide domestic energy to consumers, to enhance our national
        security, and to do so in the same responsible manner that we have developed our resources
        for a half-century.



        But Alaska IS more than oil and gas.



        We have some of the most beautiful countryside, fabulous wildlife viewing and high-
