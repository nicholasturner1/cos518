Hi Todd,



A copy of this was also sent to the Governor's office, so you might already be aware of this
request/challenge. Let me know if you are interested in participating in the

"Governors and Spouses' Challenge" and/or if the Governor's office will be taking care of it since the
request was addressed to both of you. I'd be glad to proceed with this request on your behalf-
whichever works best!




Thank you,

Erika
