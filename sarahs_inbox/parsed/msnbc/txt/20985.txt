          I could only do this, I believe, as a stop -in... nothing that I would want them to prepare
          for or make time for me. .. I'll just stop in on my own if I can squeeze it in, but don't
          want Duane to be disappointed if I can't so please don't tell him I may make it.



          What time do they start and where's the Marriott?

         Governor - I just received a phone call from Frank Bailey and he had a call from Duane
         Bannock with Division of Motor Vehicles. The Division of Motor Vehicles is having a
         system program training seminar for approximately 80 employees tomorrow, Wed., 10.03 at
         the Marriott Hotel.   This is an all day seminar. Mr. Bannock was wondering if the
         Governor would be available to stop by for a quick "thank you for all your work" to the
         employees.   I will call Mr. Bannock directly if this is something that we think can fit in
         for tomorrow.   Thank you, Janice
