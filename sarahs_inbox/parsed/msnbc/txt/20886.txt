           Dear Mr. Shepherd,



           I believe you or someone from your organization has already spoken with Andy Mills in the
           Governor ' s Juneau Office . After consulting with him, I found that he had already replied
           in the negative to your organization , as the permission form contained clauses that we
           cannot comply with.



           Also, any request that is any way campaign or partisan-related must be directed to the
           appropriate campaign, per Alaska State Ethics Law.



           Thank you,



           Kate Morgan

           Communications Director

           MESSAGE--

           I'm contacting you as an editor of the English Wikipedia and do not represent the
           Wikiemdia Foundation or any of its members. Our current article on Mrs. Palin
           (http:// en.wikipedia . org/wiki / Sarah Palin ) is in need of a free-use image of high quality
           and integrity .  We have an abundance of images of Mrs. Palin , but believe that an image
           from the State of Alaska would be of better quality than any image one of our editors
           could provide .  Due to our non-free content policy we are forced to use freely licensed
           images when they are available over copyrighted ones. Would it be possible for the State
           of Alaska to provide a freely licensed image of Mrs . Palin for use in our article?




           Yours faithfully,



           Stephen Shepherd
