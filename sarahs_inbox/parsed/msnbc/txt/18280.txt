          Dear Mr. Tannehill:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means , and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

         Governor

          I agree 200% with your budget cuts. I feel that our great legislature really goes to far
          with frivilous requests for funding by the State. Alot of this stuff can either be bonded
          by the municipalities or can be done with donated money and labor.
