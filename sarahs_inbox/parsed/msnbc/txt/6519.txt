              Governor,

              Today, I was interviewed by the FBI regarding the PPT and SGDA issues and votes last year. We spent most of
              the time talking about background and context . It is clear that they have a lot of evidence , but they are looking for
              help in describing the backdrop against which their evidence can be portrayed. They also are working hard to
              understand the legislative process itself. I think my input helped them.

              They have asked me to come back and talk to them about specific amendments that were offered in committee
              and on the floor during the debate on PPT. They need help understanding what each of the amendments meant
              and who would benefit if each were passed . It occurs to me that the memo I prepared for you that outlines the
              debate on amendments as well as the process itself would be helpful for them . However, as far as I'm concerned,
              that work product belongs to you as my employer. It was generated for you , you authorize the salary I earned
              while working on it, and decisions regarding its use (or non-use) are up to you.

              I have agreed to call them tomorrow afternoon once I am done with my scheduled appointments. If you would like
              me to share it with them , please drop me a line letting me know . Otherwise, I will continue to answer the
              questions they have and otherwise be helpful-but without sharing the specific workproduct.

              Joe
