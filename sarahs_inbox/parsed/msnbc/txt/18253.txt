          Dear Mr. Prax:



          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY200B Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

         Governor

         I applaud your budget vuts, especially the 2 million form removing a hill here in Valdez.
         Also good were your cuts to things like the Boy Scouts. As an Eagle Scout from Fairbanks I
         know first hand the benefits of being a Scout. However no where in the scout Law does it
         say anything about begging from the government for money. The support for these programs
         should come from the private community, not from the taxpayers.



         My only suggestion is to cut more next time. There was too much asked for and too much
         left in. Valdez as usual and like many others will continue to ask for more just because
         it can. Irresponsible, yes, but true. As Nancy Reagan said, "just say no."



         Best Regards

         Joe Prax
