             MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,




             I read on a daliy bases the disagreement between you and our legislators in Juneau
             concerning overspending. I encourage you to stand your ground, by trying to add
             unnecessary spending to the state budget and justifiying this simply because the oil tax
             revenue is flowing freely is poor judgement. When any government body gets carried away
             with spending that cannot be justified this leads to a government for more government as
             opposed to government for the people. You are the first Alaskan governor since Jay Hammond
             that is keeping sight of the will of the general public.



             Thanks for your service
