       Hi Governor!   It's been very nice weather in Juneau, and very very quiet here with you all
       gone!  They will box your office up tomorrow and begin asbestos removal Friday. That will
       take a week, then they will put in a new ceiling and new lights, which is due to be
       completed by the last week of July. I think it will look so much nicer when it's done. Dan
       doesn't talk much about work at home, but he's been very busy and I assumed it was jet
       related.  I hope it's sold, that is one of the items I'll be so glad to see filed in the
       history files!   Good luck on the budget, I know the job before you is tedious and
       enormous!  After that's done, I hope you can take a deep breath and enjoy the 4th of July
       with your family!   Kari

       Hi K:

       It's sunny here - but we're knee-deep in budget cutting so can't enjoy the 70-plus-degrees
       today - can't feel the sun on our shoulders inside the building :(



       Hope all is well there - I'm glad we didn't schedule much in the evenings this week be
       these are long days in the budget deliberations.



       Thanks Kari!      I hope you have an enjoyable, mellow day.



       And there's rumors that we may have the jet sold?!              If so- Dan deserves a toast.
