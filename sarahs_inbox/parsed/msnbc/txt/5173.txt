            Chris:



            It seems to me that anytime the State of Alaska spends public funds, it has to do so in
            conformance with various state laws and regulations. Would Admin Svcs be the right shop
            to give us a read on whether the contract proposed by Mr. Speigel is something we can
            legally--or fiscally--do?



            Joe

            I don't expect that anyone thinks the state is giving Mr. Spiegel any

            money, but I think we need to followup on this with a letter. Mr.

            Spiegel continues to visit DNR on a daily basis, for the majority of the

            day, awaiting an answer from the Governor. I am available to discuss

            this in the afternoon if that is possible. I will start drafting a

            letter as I expect that request may be forthcoming.
