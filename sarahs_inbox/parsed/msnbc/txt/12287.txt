           Does he know I don't have a plane, and only rarely do I get to use DPS's turbo prop King
           Air?!

           Sen. Stevens was stuck in Juneau and was calling me this morning in an effort to see if he
           could "pay to charter the governor's plane" out of Juneau. Thought you'd be interested if
           he didn't get with you or your office on this. J
