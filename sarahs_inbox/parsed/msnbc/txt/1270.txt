MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your new baby! I am a mother to a 2 month old boy who was
diagnosed with Down Syndrome 10 minutes after he was born. I too, had prenatal testing done, but
my tests came back all normal. I love my son so much, and even more so. I am pretty sure you will
have the best early intervention team working with your family! Of course you know that there are
plenty support groups for families like us out there! Again congrats and enjoy your new baby!
