  Subject : Gov Schedule 5-5 to 5-8.pdf
  I have attached the Governor's schedule for the next 4 days. The contact number for Kathy Hosford in
  Skagway is 983-3799, that is where Chuck and Sally will be. Fred and Shane have a room reserved in
  town for the night, and they have a 8 passenger van so they can deliver the Governor anywhere she
  needs to go. Please call me if I can help with anything else! I'll be at the Little League event on Saturday
  because my kids are both on teams this year. Kari.
