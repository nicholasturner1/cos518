              Governor.

              Agency personnel are reviewing loan and grant programs and dates for disbursement of municipal revenue
              sharing amounts to Adak. The thought is that while we have not received a request from Adak for help, we would
              go ahead and fax a letter to the Mayor letting him know what state loan and grant programs are available and how
              to apply for them. At that point, the ball will be in Adak's hands as to whether to try and take advantage of the
              programs.

              Another factor is that apparently Adak is owed quite a bit of money in fish taxes that have not been paid and
              probably caused at least in part, a domino effect on Adak's ability to pay its fuel bull. We will be looking into that
              as well with Department of Revenue.

              We will keep you posted throughout the day.

             Governor.

             There is a fuel issue in Adak. The local supplier is refusing to extend further credit to the city for fuel. The city
             owes roughly $500,000 now. The city and the supplier (Aleut Corp.) are talking to try and resolve the, issues.
             There is plenty of fuel in Adak , the supplier is just unwilling to sell more to the city on credit.

             I will look into whether either of the loan programs we just expanded with increased loan limits in the recent
             special session could be used by Adak to get through the crisis , when they will receive their municipal revenue
             sharing payments, etc. and report back. If these programs or others are available to help Adak_we will let them
             know right away.

             Randy

             Greg:

             Please let me know whether Adak has received its municipal revenue sharing payments, and if not, when
             they are due to be paid.

             Also, please let me know whether the bridge loan program administered at Commerce that we just
             increased in special session to a $750,000 maximum limit is available to the City of Adak.

             Also, if there is any emergency loan or grant sources, please let me know.

             Sarah:

             Are there any loan or grant programs that Adak can apply for that are administered by AEA?
