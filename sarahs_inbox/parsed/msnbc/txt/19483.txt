              You were right on in your presser. It told the story. Don't know why they changed it- they now
              need a follow-on presser that incorporates what it is I saw and approved Thanks

              This was the good one, with the good explanation in quotes from Chuck. It didn't go out with the
              one-sentence addition about rural drugs/alcohol:
              (What happened to this presser?)
              Pis send out add-on (not a "correction") to further illustrate where we are w changes at DPS, it's
              summed up nicely in his quotes that were eliminated.
