                Governor,
               As you know, the fish came in very hard in early July, with a catch of2.6 million fish in a single day. This
                led to limits and shutdowns as processors struggled to keep up. After the season, we will have ADF&G's
                best guess of how many fish went unharvested due to these limits. We have foreign owned processors in
               the bay now (shorebased) and we have floaters (U.S. owned). We just don't have any foreign owned
               floaters. It's not that big of a leap, they just require a different permit. Also, even our existing processors
                have told us that they do not mind competition as long as everyone is on a level playing field. I have also
               reminded the press that we met with processors prior to the season to encourage them to bring as much
               capacity as possible to the bay and also worked with some of our contacts to find out if there was foreign
               interest out there. We didn't get any applications for this season for foreign floaters, but what I have told
               people is that when the 2009 forecast comes out in November, if we are expecting another big year, we
               will do everything possible to be sure that fishermen have the opportunity to harvest that resource. We
               will let it be known far and wide that there is an opportunity for investment in our seafood industry here in
               Alaska and we will work with interested folks to get that capacity here. We can use our Office of
               Economic Development, our International Trade people, and other contacts we have to get the word out.
               There is no doubt that many existing companies did step up and increase capacity, just as they told us
               they would. However, there is also no doubt that it still was not enough and more investment in that
               region is needed if large runs continue.
               I did talk with Bob for about 35 minutes the other day and provided him with much of this information.
               Cora

               Before ui talk to him let me ask if there's any news on the processor front- any facts/figures I can
               share w him... and what can we do to allow more processors in areas where there are the
               continual limits and shut downs, due to lack of capacity.
