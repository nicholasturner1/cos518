MESSAGE:

I just wanted to congratulate you on the birth of your son. I always thought / hoped that God gave
special children to special people. My daughters (Madeline, 18, Margaret, 16) and I had the great
pleasure of visiting your spectacular state last year, and I assure you it is an experience we share
with everyone who will listen. You are already blessed with family and environment. I know you have
the strength for whatever is ahead. Alaska is fortunate to have you as her governor.



With all good thoughts,

Nancy McGohey
