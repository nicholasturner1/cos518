        He said the leg funded the project last year too. The builder ran into cost over runs this
        year, was losing revenue, so kevin asked john to offer it on the sen side. He doesn't
        think changepoint has anything to do w the project-it's just on their property. (The
        recent articles say otherwise). He said it was a priority of his bosses. I asked why and
        he didn't know. Nebulous answer...

        Ask him what Meyers role was. And can we find out who and why Cowdery was asked to put
        this in budget?



        This was a topic today in Anch office.
