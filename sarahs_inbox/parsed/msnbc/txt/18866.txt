          I agree with all the previous statements , and I like Russ ' s suggested response.



          In my two conversations with Hollis this morning , the rub was the difference between his
          letter ' s call for an open presentation of the gross vs. net debate that took place within
          the administration , and the reporters statement that " Sen. Hollis French said he knows
          there are members of the Palin team who don ' t agree with her oil tax plan."



          Hollis says that the reporter mischaracterized his letter , and that he was glad to hear
          that there is currently no dissention .  He did not currently know of any person who
          disagreed , but he still wants to hear the details of the debate.



          I told him I was disappointed with the way that his view was portrayed , and I'd appreciate
          it if he would contact the reporter and tell him that he was misquoted .  He resisted this
          and said that the reporter just tweaked his letter to emphasize an aspect that would
          heighten the perceived conflict .  He said he thought the Governor came across well in the
          story and we're " on the same page."



          I asked him to review the story on KTW . com and decided if he was comfortable with the way
          it was portrayed , because if I were him I'd want to clarify my position . He said he
          would, but I did not get the impression that he expected to call the reporter.
                                                                    1

          Good quotes for Hollis.




          It's not a matter of needing thicker skin tho, it's a matter of stating truth, firmly, so
          Alaskans can trust our motives and actions. All too often we hear publicly something
          that's spun political, it's our job to set it straight and then let Alaskans judge for
          themselves. It won't be a knee-jerk reaction when we respond appropriately and timely to
          anything we know is being used to deceive the public.



         A reporter is meeting me in a few minutes on wolf control - but he'll no doubt ask about
         ACES and politics, too.



         Hollis laid out serious allegations about dissent from within. We'll now answer it.
