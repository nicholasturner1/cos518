        Governor, I have already talked with Marty. She and Nan will call the written media.
        Also preparing a compass piece. I was going to call the Mike Pocaro show but will call
        Sharon first so we are on the same page.



        Also I am only sending this email to you as confidential. The meeting with TC went
        extremely well.  Thanks for your help with Hal. The

       Pls keep in touch with Sharon on this b/c I do anticipate the afternoon talk shows will
       run with it - as the morning show made it a very negative issue for us. Do you want
       someone on the Fagan and

       /or Pocorro and other shows today? Pls let Sharon know...

        In today's cabinet meeting the Governor asked that we make sure we have people involved
        and we stay ahead of the AGIA deadline extension discussion. We need to be involved where
        necessary with talk shows , media, business etc so Alaskans can understand where we are
        (positive interest ) versus the nay sayers . We are hearing no applicants and we are
        listening to complaints that we don ' t know where they are even coming from . Marty, since
        you are traveling would you call and lets discuss as soon as possible. Thanks Tom
