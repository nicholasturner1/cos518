              Laura Ingraham just mentioned the governor as a good VP pick on Greta van Susteren (sp?).

              Right She usually just reads part of it - not the whole thing. But like you said, we can distribute it.

             Not sure if she'll actually read the whole thing , given that we're trying to keep this fairly succinct, but we
             would distribute it to reporters.

              I am sending verbage for a proclamation to Jessalynn. She is going to expedite it through the process and get it
              back to us ASAP Monday. The Governor will be reading the proclamation at a bill signing event on Monday. If you
              both could please help us work with Jessalynn to get it printed off on the right paper and put in the binder for the
              Governor Monday that would be very, very helpful . Thanks!

              Governor,

              I just spoke with one of our attorneys again . The parties reached agreement on many points but not all. I
              understand APOC is meeting to decide whether the objections the plaintiff is still raising over the website
              are valid. If APOC rejects plaintiffs remaining objections, we expect the website can go back up. If
              APOC finds the plaintiffs remaining concerns are valid , they will issue a final decision prohibiting the state
              from posting the website. Our attorneys anticipate a ruling by APOC tonight.

              Larry
