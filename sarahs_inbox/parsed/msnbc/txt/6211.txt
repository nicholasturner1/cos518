              Fellow Commissioners,

              I had a similar meeting today with Mr. Ludwig. Earlier, I had read the stack of emails from DEC employees that
              he had provided to my office. The points he covered in our meeting were consistent with what I read in the
              employee emails and in a study on job satisfaction recently completed for DEC by the McDowell Group. More
              competitive salaries and benefits was a common theme.

              Recruitment and retention are a challenge for all of our departments. There is the overriding need for a
              sustainable operating budget. At the same time we have an aging workforce and a lot of competition from private
              employers and the federal government in hiring young, talented people.

              I look forward to working with Annette and the rest of you on this. I appreciate Annette providing the draft AO at
              the last cabinet meeting.

              Larry

              I had the same experience as Walt, except my stack looks more like 8 inches. I have to admit
              they get a sympathetic ear from Commissioners who hear nothing but recruitment and

              retention complaints from all divisions. I recognize that we're in a negotiation, and I gave them
              no commitment other than hear them out, which I did. I'd like to hear more about the proposed
              AO, though.

              I, for one have been contacted, and left with an approximate 5 inch high stack of paperwork. I do recall that this
              general issue has been discussed between all of us earlier, I also understand that we are working for a fair
              resolution to these negations and had stated so.

              Commissioners:

              I'm aware that Bruce Ludwig, Business Agent for the APEA-Supervisory Unit, has
              either met with some you or is requesting a meeting with you. I want to remind you
              that labor negotiations are just that - negotiations. We have been negotiating in
              good faith with the union which represents some employees in your department.

              I have my charge from Governor Palin and I understand what the bottom line is.
              What I need you to do, is remember that as Bruce tells you his concerns - you have
              perhaps not heard the issues from my perspective.

              Please contact me directly with any questions you might have as a result of your
              conversations with Bruce.  I have done more to be transparent about labor

              We are all in this together. We all need quality, professional State employees.
              Governor Palin has the draft administrative order I referred to in our last Cabinet
              meeting and I expect we'll be moving forward shortly.
