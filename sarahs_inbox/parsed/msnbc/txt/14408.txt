            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,  Congratulations on both the birth of your lovely boy, Trig and your stand
            on the worth of every human being, unborn and born. It was such a relief and a pleasure
            to hear a public official speak in such a way. In Washington state it is indeed rare.
            Just wanted you to know how much you are appreciated and to let you know prayer for you
            and your family will be offered up. Thanks' again-Sincerely Rose Sasaki
