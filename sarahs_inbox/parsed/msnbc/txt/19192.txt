          and right now it's at 587, so we have room to expand copy.

              speak for themselves . We are proud of having had the opportunity to learn from you as well as share our realities with you.

              Thank you for having been a part of DNR's Office of Habitat Management and Permitting and the larger DNR family. Our
              best to each of you as you move forward with your careers!
