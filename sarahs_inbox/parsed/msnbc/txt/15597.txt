           Is Wesley at the conference today? He hasn't responded to an email I

           sent him earlier.

           It would be helpful for wesley and other reporters to note who's not

           here again today (leadership), and who is here AGAIN today (for

           instance: lyda's competitor in her race, linda menard, is here again

           today).



           I can not believe sen prez and resources committee chairman arent here·-

           esp after charlie spent all that time in China recently to learn about a

           competing project - but won't spend time here learning about TC Alaska?
