         Water-Mining Initiative Fails Legal Test




         June 22, 2007, Anchorage, Alaska - Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell denied certification
         yesterday of an application for an initiative related to water and mining. The initiative
         would have set out water quality-related prohibitions for any new metallic mining
         operations over 640 acres in size.



         According to Lieutenant Governor Parnell, "The initiative would impermissibly allocate
         public lands and waters away from mining uses. The people, via Alaska's constitution and
         statutes, reserved these powers of appropriation to the legislature."



         Lieutenant Governor Parnell's decision was supported by an Alaska Department of Law legal
         opinion, dated June 21, 2007, which concluded that "the initiative goes beyond regulation
         and is an impermissible allocation of public assets." The Department of Law relied on
         Alaska Supreme Court case precedent to conclude that the initiative improperly prevents
         concurrent use of resources by allocating both public land and water away from mining
         activity.  The lieutenant governor's decision may be appealed within 30 days.



         The Department of Law's memo is available online at
                                                                   1
