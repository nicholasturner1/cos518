           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on your veto of the $58 million earmark spending. It took a great deal of
           intestinal fortitude to take that step. As an ex-Alaska resident I am always interested in
           what is happening in "our" state. The other states in the US of A need more leadership
           like you have shown. Keep up the good work.



           Respectfully

           Wells G "Bill" Carswell
