  Todd,

  I started some background checks today and will share with you tomorrow if you're in the office. What a
  day, huh? Taking people off boards, putting them on. The news was good tonight. The governor has
  been great the last couple of nights on the news. Her statements are right on.

  Thanks for stopping by today,


  Ivy Frye
  Director of Boards and Commissions
  Office of Governor Sarah Palin
