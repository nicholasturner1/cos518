               Of course!    Ginger Johnson was the organizer. I'll give her a call.

               Ivy- would you invite the gals who did this amazing decorating to stay for a glass of wine
               after the public leaves the open house tomorrow night? And Erika- may we get them
               something as a Thank You?



               This really is amazing...
