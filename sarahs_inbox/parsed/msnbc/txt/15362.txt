        Harris's office just called back and has further offered to redirect                   some funds from leg
        council if necessary to supplement funding for litigation.

         I have had conversations with Speaker Harris and his staffer on the use of the funds for
         litigation. They are ok with the idea and would send us a portion of the funds for
         litigation but would like to retain some of the funds for a strategy to be determined at a
         later date on trying to develop a grass roots effort on revamping ESA in the future. We
         can talk more about that later. I am waiting for a follow up call from Harris's office
         confirming what I just stated. Rep Harris seems to be ok with it, they were going to call
         Sen. Green and get back to me.
