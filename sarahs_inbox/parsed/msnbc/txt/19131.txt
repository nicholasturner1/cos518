              Subject: BP Corrosion Efforts
             I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M Hill that are currently under contract with BP and
             tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more than 100 people. An
             announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel informed. The reason as it was
             explained to me is that there are safety concerns with winter work. Sorry I don't have more details, but
             this was passed on to me third-hand just a few minutes ago.
