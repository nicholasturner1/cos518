                   Subject: Telephone Calls

                 Governor - There were two telephone calls today requesting a meeting with you.

                     1) Mayor Begich called the COS to get a meeting set up with you . Mayor Begich would like this to take
                       place before the session . The COS recommends that this be set the week of January 7 - or if you would
                       like the COS will meet with the Mayor directly. If we decide to schedule a time, I will contact the Mayor's
                       office for an updated topic list
                    2) Jim Mulva w/Conoco Phillips would like a telephone call with you tomorrow, Friday, 12.28.07. The topic
                       is COP's ANS Gas Proposal. Joe Balash is aware of this request and would like to bring it up in the 2:00
                       p.m. meeting this afternoon.

                 Thanks, Janice
