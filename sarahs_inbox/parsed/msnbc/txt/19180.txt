         Pat Galvin got an email early this morning from Tom Wright's wife on the same subject.
         Either he told her the same thing that he told me, or their source is the same person. In
         that case, I would suspect that person is their son.

         Who?



         See, it will be important to know the legitimacy of this rumor so our overseeing agency
         can be properly prepared.

          It was third - hand . A former staffer with a buddy on the Slope told me . His contact is
          somebody at BP that ' s up there ... and the BP person learned of it this afternoon.

         Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
         fixes...

          I just received word that personnel with Veco / CH2M Hill that are currently under contract
          with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
          than 100 people . An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
          informed . The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
          winter work.  Sorry I don't have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand
          just a few minutes ago.
