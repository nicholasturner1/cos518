          Governor:



          I am unaware of who the constituent is and do not have any inquiries from a

          Marine parent.     We will try and find out more.



          Also, have not heard from John Minnick on support needs, but will have my

          staff check with him to ensure he is getting what he needs.



          Craig

            Anyone know who she's been trying to contact in my office? I have not heard.

            I did have lunch with all the Vet organizations, here at the mansion, to work

            with them on getting supplies for deployed personnel - it was John Minnick's

            (and others) group. Sears gave them a discount on supplies that Diana Straub

            was requesting for one deployed battalion. Pls see what you can do here, so

            this constituent is helped and doesn ' t take it out on us in a newspaper

            interview. Thanks Sent from my BlackBerry® device from Cellular One

           Good Morning Governor,



           I thought you should see this article (link below) that was in yesterday's

           Frontiersman .    About two thirds into the article this Wasilla constituent

           says that she has contacted the Governor's office and will continue to email

           every day until she gets a response .    Since her son is in the Marines I gave

           her initial correspondence, which was sent last week, to Senator Murkowski's

           office in Wasilla. I spoke with Senator Murkowski's office again this

           morning; they are on top of this and will be contacting her directly. I also

           called her myself and told her the steps our office had taken.
                                                            2
