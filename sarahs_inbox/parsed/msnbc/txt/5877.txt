            clear as mud - thanks!

            Also, I called my dad and asked him what the heck his name is doing on a document being
            circulated in this building that lists "Those Opposed to Denby..." and he insists he's NEVER
            opposed you (I believe him!) but did contact Charlie Huggins asking for more information on
            Ken b/c he'd heard that Ken wanted to neuter wolves. He said his contact with Charlie is the only
            thing he can think of that would have put him on that list - and he shouldn't be on that list.

              You have asked: "Denby: did you do a formal emergency order on the pred.
              cont. issue?" This is with regard to language in the two previous "wolf
              control" initiatives, from 1996 and 2000.

              Below is a lengthy explanation of the two initiatives, and subsequent
              amendment by the legislature, by Kevin Saxby of our Attorney General's
              office.

              The upshot with regard to your question, however, is that the 1996
              initiative language was subsequently amended by the legislature in 1999, so
              there is no longer any provision or requirement for the commissioner of
              ADF&G to declare a "biological emergency" in order to conduct operations
              under existing statute and regulation in "wolf control areas."

              So, no, I have not issued a formal emergency finding or emergency order.
              But, yes, we are in compliance with state law.

            below - he still needs to have Stedman look at it and he would like for us to see it, too. It's
            much of what was heard yesterday - positive tone, but inside it does discuss a thorough
            analysis of the gas tax before approving the AGIA. That doesn't mean much for the average
            person at home, but as Commissioner Galvin pointed out yesterday, does mean a lot to us
            in terms of the timeline. The rest is appears to be extremely complimentary.

                                             Palin Gasline Plan Train Track to our Future

            Governor Palin understands that there are two parts of the process that need to come together to
            have a success. AGIA was designed to address both. Let's look at the needs of each and how
            AGIA addresses them in a way that increases the likelihood of getting a gas pipeline sometime
            before our grandchildren are grown.

            The most important issue to address is making sure that the upstream shipper/producer has what
            it needs to come to the open season and bid their gas in the form of firm transportation
            commitments. Without those commitments any pipeline company would be hard pressed to
            finance a project of this magnitude. Some have said it would be impossible to finance this project
            without them.

            So what do the producers require ? From their testimony they have said they need fiscal certainty. Fiscal
            certainty for them means making sure that the state doesn't increase their taxes in the future after they
            have committed to firm transportation (FT) commitments lasting 20 years or longer that obligate them to
            ship their gas on the pipeline. That commitment will enable the pipeline company to finance the pipeline
            because the producers have, in essence, agreed to pay for that pipeline over the next 20 years through the
            tariff. The tariff is what the pipeline company charges the producers to ship their gas.

            The inducement in AGIA is the state will provide the producers with fiscal certainty on the taxes they
            pay on the gas if the producers show up at the first binding open season . It is clean and straight forward.
            Two questions remain . What should the tax be and what should the term be?

            First, the term. The governor has recommended 10 years in AGIA; the producers negotiated a contract
            for 35 years under the Stranded Gas Development Act (SGDA), and the term of their FT commitment
            could be around 20 years. Certainly the 35 years is out and it doesn 't make sense for the state to commit
            to anything greater that the producer commitment to the pipeline of around 20 years . So the boundaries
            are set, somewhere between 10 and 20 years . The legislature gets to decide based on what they think is a
            fair exchange for inducing a shipper to commit their gas at the initial open season.

            Second, the tax. What is a reasonable gas tax. Last year the legislature went through a thorough process
            of redesigning the oil and gas tax, creating the petroleum production tax (PPT). For purposes of this
            discussion I will assume that they came up with a fair tax on oil. At the time the focus was on oil, a
            thorough review of what the tax on gas should be was not done. Some have said that was because the
            gas tax was fixed in the proposed SGDA contract . What the legislature needs to do is a thorough
            analysis of the gas tax to see if it should be raised or lowered and if the progressivity provision in the oil
            tax works for gas. Once they make that determination, and a change if necessary, they are ready to pass
            AGIA fixing the tax for the term necessary to provide the producers with the fiscal certainty the believe
            is necessary to commit their gas to the first open season.

           Next what does a pipeline company require to move forward with the project and what do we require of
           a pipeline company . First, we need a pipeline company that has the expertise to carry out the project: the
           technical expertise to build a complex project in this harsh arctic environment , the capable staff that
           understand and can manage a project of this magnitude , and the financial strength to see the project
           through to the end even if there are substantial unforeseen cost overruns.

           What the pipeline company needs is for the state to not abandon them for a "better" project part way
           through the process . If they are going to risk hundreds of millions of dollars they want fiscal certainty on
           this risk dollars . Seems like a reasonable request.

           What AGIA does is give them that certainty, first through a substantial contribution to the project - up
           to $500 million, then through a damages clause that says if we abandon them for another project they get
           three times their investment back.

           Some have said that any pipeline company that has the financial strength to build what may end up
           being a $30 billion pipeline doesn 't need a $500 million contribution. But they miss the point of the
           contribution. The reason for the contribution is about state commitment to the project and to the selected
           licensee, not about need . If the state is willing to contribute a substantial sum of money and agrees to
           substantial damages if it abandons the licensee , it will think seriously before it takes that step. This
           should be sufficient to entice most pipeline companies to compete to become the licensee.

           All told AGIA has the elements necessary to encourage a successful gas pipeline . There are probably
           changes that need to be made, but the basic structure is in place. Lets figure out what changes need to be
