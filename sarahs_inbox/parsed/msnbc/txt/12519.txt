             Sharon- its looking like leggies are actually on track to finish up in 90 days , but if we
             have to hold them or call special session to consider AGIA then we have to strategize with
             gasline team on timing of such.



             We were the nice guys last year on location of special session and " suggested " special
             session take place in Anchorage, this time it's obvious they desire more direction so I'll
             be calling it in Anchorage. It's nonsensicle to ask Revenue , DNR, Oil and Gas, Law, press,
             public, etc to fly to Juneau to take care of AGIA this go 'round. It'll be taken care of
             on the more convenient road system.



             So, if asked, that's my answer - but I do understand we may want to strategize on
             announcing those intentions. Thanks[
