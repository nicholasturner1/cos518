           Dear Gov. Palin, I hear your name mentioned as a VP canidate so I know if you speak they
           will listen.  The.way to win is for the National Republican Committee to make an
           documentary style infomercial that gives a history of the Democrats blocking the opening
           of ANWR and then getting all the GOP canidates to stay on message till the tail is pinned
           on the dockey and this oil crisis belongs to the Democrats. Nobody ever stayed on message
           as well as you did against Gov. M and you won. I believe the national GOP could be as
           successful.




          Also I would rather you stay here in our great state as long as Obama doesn't win.
          Sincerely L Dubber
