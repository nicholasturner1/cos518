             Thanks Erika.



             I misunderstood and didn't realize the bed was already in the cedar closet. Yes, see what
             it would take to get the power extension there... it shouldn't take much and should be
             compared to a situation such as during this renovation had we had a need for a dryer to be
             placed upstairs instead of in this guest bathroom- what would that extension take? I just
             don't want Linda making a big deal out of this- and don't want family requests to be made
             public in any way as they had through Stephanie. Thanks!
