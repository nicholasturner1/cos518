             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the birth of Trig. We have a son who had Down Syndrome and passed away
             June 2, 2007 with a rare strep infection.  He was 21 years old and the absolute joy of our
             lives.  He worked as an assistant at Silverdale Baptist Academy and influenced more
             children and adults than I thought possible. Forget all the stereotypes. The sky is the
             limit.  Our son, Ryan, was more like Jesus than any person I have ever known but we still
             had many challenges and adventures that we miss dearly. We grieve deeply at our loss but
             rejoice with your gain and we grieve with hope - the hope and assurance we will see him
             soon. God used ryan greatly and my wife and I pray that God will use Trig in a great and
             wonderful way.



             God Bless,

             Jack & Charlene LaMar Psalm 139: 13-16
