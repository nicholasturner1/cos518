            I think the intro to Michael should be enough? Instead of both?

           Governor - On Friday , March 14 at 7:00 p . m. per Karl Clauson - you are confirmed to do the
           Introduction of Michael Steele at the Republican Convention. They are also hoping that
           you will be available to give the Delegate Welcome at 9:00 a . m. that same day. They have
           to go to print by this afternoon and we need to confirm both engagements .    Kris has
           indicated that there is work underway on a speech for this. Thanks , Janice
