               On behalf of the Chugiak-Eagle River Historical Society, Chugiak Area Business Association,
               and the Chugiak Lions club I am inviting you to the 60th Anniversary Celebration for the
               community of Chugiak. 2007 marks sixty years since the formation and naming of the
               community in 1947.

               The celebration will include a free barbecue, and the presentation of proclamations passed by the
               Alaska Legislature and the Anchorage Assembly by Chugiak-area legislators and assembly
               members.

               I and the community would appreciate your attendance.

               Best regards,


               Bill Stoltze
