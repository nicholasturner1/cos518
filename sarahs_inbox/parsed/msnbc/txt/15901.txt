           MESSAGE:

            Thank you, thank you, thank you. I am so pleased you are suing for the right to explore
            for oil and help make the nation enegry independent. Too bad criminal charges against
            some members of congress and a former president could not have been included. The next
            couple of years in prison might have helped them become rational, logical, and learn some
            common sense.  And, for your sake, please stay as far away as you can from Senator McCain
            - a walking disaster.
