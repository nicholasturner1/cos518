               What cleaning products are used in the Governor's Mansion?

               Especially any that are sprayed?


                 Maybe it is NOT a genetic issue, but a chemical exposure that damages our child's genes?

               I wonder about whether or not Down's Syndrome itself could happen because of a
               malfunctioning immune system ? ... that EGBE exposure would cause ? ... sniffles, flatulence,
               diarrhea, 'flu' are what exposure looks like.

              If so, I think glyconutrients should be checked into for good. nutrition for mom and baby

                Thanks for the message I will make sure this gets into the record as part of the backup for this appropriation. I will
                also make sure the OMB director receives a copy as well.
