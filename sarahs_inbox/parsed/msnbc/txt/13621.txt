            Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items
            was a package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkoweki jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch
            w/Binkley and his wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one
            bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500. :)
