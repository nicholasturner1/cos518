          Gov:



          We will have a report from Pat outlining some of the deficiencies of PPT as it has been
          implemented.  It is attached.  There is a chart/graph in the report that we will have
          blown up for the press conference, too.



          We are working on talking points for you (and him) to use tomorrow morning.



          Joe

          Sharon- would u correct with Steve Quinn the fact that I've only traveled outside once
          since session ended? He wrote online (will be printed tomorrow) that I've spent my time
          traveling out of state during the interim. The correction is I was in Michigan for the two
          days before traveling to Kuwait, but otherwise have been wrking from Anchorage and
          traveling within the state.

         Also, ktuu made it sound like we'll have details on sp sess tomorrow, incl location and
         incl Pat ' s analysis . He's not ready to reveal findings on that, nor propose solutions yet,
         so tomorrow ' s messaging will have to be well thought out. We also dont have location
         chosen yet either as fairbanks and Anchorage will hopefully be competing for the session
         (Kris spoke with mayor whittaker on this, I haven't heard yet if anything was decided from
         their conversation and/or other conversations with the Capt Cook in Anchorage...).



         I'll cc the others so they can help with messaging for tomorrow . I will focus on taking up
         Speaker Harris ' request to revisit ppt back many weeks ago and the reasons he gave then as
         to why leggies need a sp session.
