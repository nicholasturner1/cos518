             Dear fellow Alaskans,

             Providing for the safe movement of people and goods and the delivery of state services
             is a top priority of my administration. In light of that, I wanted to share some recent
             achievements and progress with you from the state's Department of Transportation and
             Public Facilities regarding the state of the Alaska Marine Highway System, your ferry
             system in Alaska.

             Please visit http://www.gov.state.ak.us/pdf/AMH.Sreport August2008.pdf to find out
             about the progress we've made.

             Until next time,
             Governor Sarah Palin
