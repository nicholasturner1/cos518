               Maddam Governor:



               As a resident of Kansas and an independent, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the
               great work you've done in cleaning up your state! I know you have said publicly that you
               aren 't looking for a higher office, but if you were to run as a VP I think it would help
               either party you chose to run with. Keep up the good work!
