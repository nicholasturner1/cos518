         Dear Governor:



         Re: Dimond Alumni Field Project



         It was very disapponting to have our project funding vetoed this last week. We have been
         working on this project the last 8 years. We are a non profit organization that have zero
         dollars spent for administration cost (100' volunteer). We use every dime that comes in to
         the project(s) we are working on. We the Alumni have done the mainteneance on the field
         the last 8 years because of the tight funds for the school district for maintenance.

         Because of our long standing accomplishments in our community we were able to put in place
         a number of ways to save cost for this project (frieght $70,000.00 saving to name one).
         Because of your veto to complete this project it will cost apporx. $500,000 more plus add
         time.

         Politicians are also pleading for the communities to be involved. Well this community just
         got its face slapped.
