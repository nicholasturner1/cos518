         Hi Talis:  a reporter pointed out to me today at least three line items in the capital
         budget that sound "illegal" (he even cited chapter and verse of state law) because they
         deal with funding religious organizations/projects - sounds like Meyer plugged them into
         budget, incl a Christian school's request. I told KTUU that Law will look at items before
         i would ever sign off - and that if they do in fact violate constitution I will veto the
         items.

        Subject: Track



        Kari - Im still unsettled about my son not being able to travel to Juneau -

        not even once - as he 's part of the First Family and that is supposed to be

        the First Family' s home . As a minor, at age 17, I believe the state was

        wrong to charge him to travel          the ONE time he'd be traveling to Juneau in

        April. We felt that he could not, or should not be part of the First

        Family's activities when we were told the state wouldn't cover his one trip

        to the Governor' s House . The state covered other family member's first trip

        to our new home - I'm still at a loss as to why our son was ever excluded.

        Even the Parnell family was able to travel to Juneau (Track was out of state

        at that time the entire Parnell family was allowed a state trip to the

        Governor' s House )Would you pls run this by Linda Perez and Mike Nizich

        again, as I'll continue to walk on eggshells with travel issues , not knowing

        why the state does what it does in terms of travel.



        I dont want to sound petty about this - but until there is a sensible policy

        I will keep asking travel questions, even though it sure takes up a lot of

        valuable time.



        Thanks Kari. I dont have linda' s email so pls run the issue by her again.
