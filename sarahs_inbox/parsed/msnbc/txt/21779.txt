             It ain't perfect, format-wise, but it got out to all the important ones on the media list.

                Governor Palin Praises the Work of the House of Representatives




               November 11, 2007, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today thanked the members of the
               Alaska House of Representatives for their work in passing ACES.




               "I am sincerely grateful to all the members of the House of Representatives for their
               efforts over the past 25 days." Governor Palin said. "They have worked diligently in
               pursuing the people' s business . All Alaskans can be proud of the bill the House has
               passed."




               "I am particularly happy that the 25 percent rate was included. We worked closely with
               legislators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that Alaska remains an attractive
               place to invest in oil and gas development. At the same time, they have moved to ensure
               that Alaskans receive an equitable share of these non-renewable resources."




               "If this bill is enacted, we will all take a positive step forward in Alaska's future. I
               look forward to working with members of the Senate to preserve the good work done by the
               House tonight."




               The ACES bill now moves to the Senate.
