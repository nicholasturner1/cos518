            Governor:




            Thanks for the time meeting with AVAC.  Sorry if I did not speed Bert Hall along fast
            enough.  I was watching the clock at 15-20 minutes and waiting for an opening but he was
            pretty steady.



            I will work with the group on their issues and loop the other special assistants in where
            necessary.



            Thanks,



            Randy
