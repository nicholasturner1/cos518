         Hi Sean: yes, mike ran that by me yesterday. I didn't know details but it sounds like a
         good idea to me if you're game to do it - I understand that Marcia would feel more
         comfortable not having to visit these folks alone.



         If you end up going - enjoy the Houston heat and sun!!!

        Good morning,



         Just want to double check with you that you know about the gas team's plans for me in
        Houston this week to try to get more potential applicants. I heard from Marty and Joe B
        but wasn't able to find out if you knew or approved?? I can do it since they deem it
        important but I'd like you blessing to go, what do you think?



         Sean

         Jay-    Here is some information to assist you in organizing Lt. Gov's travel arrangements:




         Meetings so far:




         1)      Kinder Morgan, Inc. 500 Dallas St. Suite 1000, 713-369-9000



                9am Thursday may 31,



                                                        2




                                                                                                  PRA_GSP01_0002078

                Scott Parker, President, KM Pipelines, and Rock Meyer President of Western Regions
         pipelines.



                 Representative from the Chairman's office may also attend.




          2)     El Paso Corp.



                2:00pm on Thursday, May 31,



              Byron Wright, El Paso's VP of Strategic Planning, and probably a couple of his
        staff. Byron has direct experience on this project as El Paso's representative working
        with TransCanada and the producers several years ago. Jim Yardley, the President of the
        Pipeline Group, may be able to attend as well.




         There will likely be other meetings that fall into place at last minute on Tuesday. I
        have asked our consultants to try to arrange them for Friday or later in afternoon on Wed.




          Air travel-     Would recommend the following:




         ANC- IAH (Houston Intercontinental) - Continental #781



          Depart 8:50pm Tues May 29, Arrive 6:39 am Wed. May 30



         Non-stop flight time 6 hours 49 minutes




                                                           3




                                                                                                     PRA_GSP01_0002079
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com     Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




          IAH- ANC- Continental #667



          Depart 5 : 30pm Fri June 1, arrive 11 : 30pm Fri June 1



          One stop in Seattle for one hour , no plane change .      Travel time 9 hours




         If we don ' t have any Friday afternoon meetings , Lt. Gov could switch to Cont. # 1584
        leaving IAH at 3:40pm which is non-stop to Anchorage , arriving in Anchorage at 7:52pm for
        total travel time of 7 hours 12 minutes.




                 i
         (I will be on # 781 Tuesday night, and will be returning from IAH at the 5 : 30 pm time
        frame on Friday unless we can get out earlier on Friday because of no meetings.)




         Hotels-



         Myself and the two consultants will be staying in Houston in the area of the Galleria.
        This positions us well to go into downtown center and get north to Woodlands area on the
        freeways . There will be two rental cars between us.



         Attached is a sheet with wide assortment of Hotels around the Galleria .   I am staying at
        the Bradford Homesuites at 3440 Sage Road 800-246 - 8357 , a few blocks away from the heart
        of the Galleria ; the Lt . Gov might like it a little more upscale than I have selected.
