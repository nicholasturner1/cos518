           He was totally anti-CON, I felt pressure by him and Bit all the way through the CON
           messaging. Remember Kris- that Fuhs was anti-CON?

           Fuhs is a gun for hire who was         very close to Lesil and Tom. I can't remember his stance
           on it through the campaign, but        I do remember Bit making comments about how "The Governor
           needs cautiously in wiping out         CON.". I'm sure Paul's right in there. Sux that they are
           anti-competition and anti-small        business in their efforts to keep it tho.

           Why is Fuhs now testifying on the other side of the CON elimination bill? And all those
           who pressured hard to change CON are awfully quiet now that the bill is on the floor.
           Where are they now?

           Senator Lesil McGuire is to be investigated by the Select Committee on Legislative Ethics
           for possible violations of lobbying laws and legislative standards of conduct. The Alaska
           Public Offices Commission (APOC) this afternoon directed the ethics committee to look into
           McGuire ' s contract with Providence Hospital in Anchorage in 2003, when she was a state
           representative.
