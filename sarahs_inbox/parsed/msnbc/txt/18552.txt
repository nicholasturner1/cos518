             as compared to prior administrations as requested in prior emails. We

             are still working through travel documents and will need to go through

             flight logs and public safety billings to obtain complete information.

             I hope to provide the full scenario by mid-week. We will also provide

             more detailed travel scenarios specific to Anchorage travel and costs

             that I believe will provide a more accurate comparison between the

             administrations.



             I apologize again for the delay Governor, but we still have a

             significant amount of documents to work through.



             If you think of any additional area of comparison , please let me know.



             Thank you,

             Linda

            How close are we to having the numbers showing #of days former Gov(s)

            spent out of Juneau compared to my travels/housing expenses? The public

            deserves clarity on this as the misperception is I'm "living and

            working" in the Valley. If, as Security and administrators tell me, murk

            and Knowles also worked out of the Anchorage office and spent many, many

            days out of Juneau - then the fair comparison needs to be made and

            presented. The other missing point in the coverage of this issue is that

            the Anchorage office is the workplace.
