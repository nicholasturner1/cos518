          MESSAGE:

          Congrats on the birth of your son. Although the initial few months will feel like a blur
          due to appointments and assessments , take the time to enjoy your new baby boy. We have a
          2 year old son, Michael who has Down Syndrome and he is the light of.our lives. He brings
          joy to each and every day.  your son will do EVERYTHING that every other child will do, it
          will just take him a little while longer to figure out how to do it.

          Once again, congratulations on the birth of your angel.
