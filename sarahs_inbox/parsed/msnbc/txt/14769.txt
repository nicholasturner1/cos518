                Congratulations, on the birth of your son. I am sorry to hear that he has Down syndrome. I know that you
                are learning all you can about Down syndrome. I would like to give you some information that may be
                helpful to you. My grandson (6 years old) was born with a rare condition called hirschsprung's. Alot of
                children with Down syndrome also have hirschsprung 's. There were several things the doctors did not
                tell us and we had to learn the hard way. If your son has already been diagnosed with hirschsprung's or
                has problems with constipation or vomiting , you should get him tested . If he does have this problem, and
                you would like to know what the doctors didn't tell us, please e-mail at dtwss@aol.com. DO NOT
                BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CORRECTED BY A SIMPLE OPERATION, there is more to it. I will be praying
                for your family. May God bless you and your family.
