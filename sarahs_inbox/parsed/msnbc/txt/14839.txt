               WICHE Policy Alerts - May 6, 2008
               "Education Beyond the Rhetoric : Making "Rigor" Something
               Real"( htta ://www.wiche.edu/statescholars/summitisummitPolipyBrief pdf) is a new
               policy brief published by the State Scholars Initiative , which is administered by WICHE
               and funded by the U. S. Department of Education . Written to serve as the foundation for
               substantive discussions during the State Scholars Initiative National Summit on
               Academic Rigor and Relevance , this policy brief underlines the need to define academic
               rigor, demonstrates how students today receive a confusing array of messages about
               what is necessary in high school and required in college, and outlines suggestions for
               how to create systems of education that are more responsive to the needs of students
               entering a rapidly changing world.
