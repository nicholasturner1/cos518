MESSAGE:

Dear Governor,

Congratulations on the birth of your new son. I just saw where you son has special needs and just
wanted to let you know that I have identical twins with Down's Syndrome. They were Triplets B & C
and babies 8 & 9 for us. I hope that if your son's special gift is Down's that he will be visible to world
and that you can make a difference not only as a governor, but as a Mom that God has trusted with
this special gift.



Take care and know that you are not alone...
