                Paul, I am always willing to sit down and discuss energy. Give me a call and we can set up a time.

               Not sure what you meant by relaxed, but having just completed a wonderful expedition over the
               Chilkoot Trail, I will even be more relaxed than usual.

               Thanks,

               3. a copy of the recent report APA ( Alaska Power Association?) recieved from Steve Pratt-This is a
               bigger talk, but needs to be a matter of recognition for future reasons



               4. as of now ,, Rough cost and Expenditure amounts to date for rural awareness outreach



               5..a rough outline of where you are headed for your summary and energy direction and pace of
               expectations and my informal e to you on 6-16-08




               6.perhaps a brief discussion of my E -mail to Walt Wilcox with APA



               7...and also, some clarifications and retractions i would like to make which need to be addressed



               8. A need now for a Public Broadcast Energy Forum- the real deal....



               9...and finally, some idea of my earlier energy single family home and society usages descriptions
               questions i posed for your departments to help me understand more about your information available to
               the public and the formulas you are using to determine energy use awareness



               10..1 think you should weigh in on this EMISSIONs program and take some leadership role with
               hydroelectric to jump start plug ins and electric vehicles and Photovoltaic Infrastructures



               .Mr. Haagenson, I remain excited about the potential and real "Alaskas Energy Future in relationship to
               Harmonic Fuels ( electricity and water ) abundance". And eager to hear your directions - hoping you will
               evolve us as you go so we can contribute in some way along the way to a new Energy Based Alaska
               Society...



               I am more concerned than ever about how our leaders and our citizenry are going to make this new future
               come to fruition.......make it happen, now !

                plug ins comming on line big time 2010 - honda fuel cell- bmw & ford HICE engines)



               I look forward to having the honor and opportunity to meet with you if you decide to make that possible...

               ps,,,, I remain skeptical of any suggestion of continued addiction to FOSSIL FUELS in any application
               except current HEAVY INDUSTRIAL / MANUFACTURING and a couple of others ... However, we need to
               price appropriately...large user - larger prices......
