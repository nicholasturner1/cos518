          I called Sean. He didn't know about it but said he would like to. He is about 10
         minutes away from the office and will go to the conf call location... which I'll need to
         get from Mike.

          Mike and Tom are scheduled at 9am to conference with Mark M. Can you be conferenced in
         via your cell phone or would you like to have a separate call later?
