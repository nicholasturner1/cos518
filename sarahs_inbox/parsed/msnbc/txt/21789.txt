              Of course! Today, was pure pleasure, just got done shaking hands (with Gen. Layfield) with
              345 or so returning troops as they got off the 747 with their gear. I don't think I've
              seen such collectively happy faces in a long time. ( Some were troubled too--but overall,
              my spirits were lifted just by seeing them come off the plane.)



              I am told they got on the plane in Kuwait and walked into our beautiful falling snow
              tonight. Some had their heads tilted back catching the flakes in their mouth. Pure
              blessing to even be a witness to all this! Look forward to catching up when we can.

             Sandy and I went to two ceremonies on Ft Rich and I read portions of your proclamation.
             Jay is on his way to Palmer Pioneer Home and will read the same portions of your
             proclamation on your behalf. At some point about 300 warriors return to Elmendorf (within
             next three hours). Sandy and I plan to meet them. Hope your day is well--we remember you,
             Todd, Trak and family. Thanks for your guys' personal investment of your lives and that of
             your son.
