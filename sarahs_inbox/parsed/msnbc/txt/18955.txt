         Classification:      UNCLASSIFIED

         Caveats: NONE



         Governor:



         The soldiers of the Alaska Army National Guard who served in Kuwait, and who

         you visited, will be returning to Camp Shelby,             Mississippi between 12 and 15

         October.    A redeployment formation is scheduled for the morning of 17 October

         at 11:00, which will be the only formation of all soldiers as they return

         from this deployment.        We will also be having a lunch picnic immediately

         following the formation.        Once the soldiers leave Camp Shelby they will be

         authorized travel direct to their homes. So the only time available for you

         to welcome the entire unit home will be at this formation on 17 October,

         unless we consolidate them at either Anchorage or Bethel at a later time, but

         that would be at state expense.



         The leadership tells me that they have a flag you gave them in Kuwait which
                                                                1

         was flown on military vehicles during missions into Iraq. They want to

         present that flag back to you in appreciation for your support. This is the

         perfect time to have that happen ,         as they will all be together.



         I know your schedule is very hard to predict a month out ,               but I would ask

         that you pen in October 16 and 17 for the redeployment at Camp Shelby. To

         assist in your travel ,      I am arranging for a military UC-35          ( Cessna Citation)

         to fly us from Elmendorf AFB the morning of 16 October direct to Camp Shelby.

         We would RON at Camp Shelby ,         conduct the formation the next morning ,         attend

         the picnic and fly back to El
