           Governor,



          I think today went fairly well, all in all, and would like a chance to get caught up
          before tomorrow gets rolling. Is there any chance you are going to be back by the office?
          If not, would you mind if Kelly, Nizich, and I stop by the residence this evening? We
          could all use a few minutes.

    I

          Joe
