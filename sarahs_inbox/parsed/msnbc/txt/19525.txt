           Fyi, speaking of roads! Let wagonner know that I know we can use surplus for
           infrastructure... Maybe his crew needs to get into leadership so we could get some support
           for such things... see below:

           Fyi for message incorporation... projects like access roads and building up infrastructure
           for future economic growth are also on our agenda - I'm afraid Alaskans are believing
           we're "all AGIA all the time", at the exclusion of other needs. So, when we get
           opportunities to proactively incorporate into our speeches, pressers, etc our other
           focuses, we need to do so (like building up our infrastructure with a good idea like an
           access road to our minerals I see below):

           (And note, there's been no major road built since the 70's... we're in the time of surplus
           where we can build up our infrastructure to create jobs, create access to rich resources
           in areas people want roads to resources so we can diversify our economy)

          I've asked Randy to look into the preliminary work that's been done on a road to connect
          Alaskans with their resources in the rich area of Nome . No major access road has been
          built in Alaska since the 70 ' s, we're in a time of surplus where we should be building up
          infrastructure in areas people want roads and access for development , and we need to build
          access to further diversify our resource development base ... so heads up that Randy will
          be contacting you who are needed to provide him info on this as we think big and
          proactively work towards enabling development for AK's future .   Thanks!

              Remind leggies they don't have to be the bad guys and ax the program nexy year- I won't be
              proposing it next year. As Randy says, we're clear this is a one-time surplus rebate to tide folks
              over during transitional period as they weatherize their homes and fund some start up
              conservation efforts to deal with rising costs of everything.

              Thanks Kelly.

              I understand Sen. Wagoners ' concerns and there are other legislators that are wary of spending nearly
              $800m by giving it to residents. They want to control all the spending of all the money, whether there is a
              surplus or not.

              The concept of having the rebate apply to all 'residents ' is that Article 8 of our constitution establishes the
              principle of our resources belonging to all residents . I suppose a payment could go to a household
              instead and that could reduce the total spend , but if you go to households you will also get pushback from
              D's (Cissna, etc.) about people who don 't have a home to show as a household.

              As to the supplemental application process , one of the main reasons we went to it is to allow all the
              veterans who don't apply for the PFD (because the feds take it off their VA benefits) to get the benefit of
              this payment. These are disabled vets and vets over 65 making under $13,000 a year. Some of our most
              vulnerable vets.

              The transmittal letter, the bill, and my testimony are very clear that this is a special one-time payment. It
              is different than the PFD which was intended to be "permanent". But, legislators may be worried there will
              be constituents who will always want more and they have to be the bad guys next year who don 't renew
              the program. That's probably true that some constituents will always want more money . But those folks
              will want more money regardless of this bill.

              There are other needs in the State like transportation and we have introduced an appropriation bill that
              includes roads. We also introduced a transportation endowment bill last year that would have provided
              another $50 million a year for road projects statewide like the Sterling Highway project that is his number
              one priority. I think we will be introducing some sort of similar endowment bill again next session. So the
              passage of the resource rebate bill does not mean we won 't be doing things for transportation in the
              future.

              There is opposition. But I think legislators who vote no are going to have to face some very angry
              constituents who are getting hammered by high fuel prices and want some relief.

              I will continue working with C&RA members on technical or minor amendments and try to count votes this

               Subject: Sen Wagoner

               Good morning,
               Yesterday I visited with Sen Wagoner for a little while. He wanted to share his strong concerns with the rebate
               legislation. Since this will be front and center next week, it is important to pass along his comments.

                   1)       He'd like to see any approved payment apply to a household only and not to all residents. In fact,
                           he'd like to see the payment go to a person with a utility bill; possibly passing through a utility
                           company.
                   2)       He adamantly disagrees with the supplemental application.
                   3)       If it goes to the floor for a vote as it was introduced, he will not be able to support it and believes
                           others will not as well.
                   4)       His main concerns are the potential entitlement the check creates and he thinks there are other
                           ways to spend the money to assist all Alaskans i.e. infrastructure via roads etc...

               We will probably come across others who share this general opinion.

               Thanks, Kelly
