  Todd,
  I thought you might be interested in this paper I got from the processors on the topic of allowing a foreign
  floater to operate in the bay. It was prepared by Mary McDowell of Pacific Seafood Processors
  Association, the group we will be meeting with on January 22nd here in Juneau.

  Subject: "Risks and downsides" of allowing a foreign floater to operate in Bristol Bay

  Hello Cora,

  Thanks so much for the time you spent meeting with Kris Norosz, Glenn Reed, and I at the
  council meeting in Anchorage about the concerns of the seafood companies we represent
  regarding the possibility of an Internal Waters Permit being issued to allow a foreign floater to
  come in to process salmon in Bristol Bay in 2008.

  As you requested during the meeting, attached is a document we've put together to list and
  explain some of the "risks and downsides" of allowing a foreign floater to operate in Bristol
  Bay.

  Please let us know what other information would be useful to the Administration in considering
  this issue.

  Also, we'd like to reiterate that we and/or folks from the seafood companies we represent request
  a meeting with Governor Palin to discuss Bristol Bay processing issues --- past seasons as well
  as ongoing efforts and plans of the companies to meet the salmon processing needs in the Bay in
  2008 and future years. We would very much appreciate the opportunity to have such a meeting
  with the Governor during the time that the planned Bristol Bay processing capacity survey is
  being conducted and data is being compiled by the State in mid to late January.

  Again, Kris, Glenn, and I appreciate the time you spent with us in Anchorage and we look
  forward to continued communication with you on these issues.

  Happy Holidays to you and your family,
  Mary
