              Subject: Year End Interview




              Just to let you know, I did an end of the year interview with Robert - Dillon for an
              article that might appear in this Sunday's Fairbanks News = Miner.



              I briefly covered 19 issues ranging from federal appropriations to = the governor's recent
              comments on cruise ships. Part of the =discussion related to decisions made by congress
              or federal agencies this = year, and part concerned preparations for issues that may
              materialize= in 2008.




             Regarding 2007, I said that despite our apprehensions early in the = year, Alaska did well
             - some good successes and no significant defeats.&nbs= p; I observed that since 2008 is an
             election year, outcomes are more = difficult to predict. In all instances, I stuck to the
             facts, - no editorial comment, except to say that the governor and congressional =
             delegation are working well together on pending issues.



             If Dillon gets things right, and he usually does, I think the article = will describe good
             work by the Palin Administration on federal issues = in DC. If you need more, please let
             me know.
