          Sharon - I don't think ADN was ever corrected re: what happened to Privileged ' s email she
          sent ( offering to have me look at her files against Kopp ) back on July 13. We need to
          explain I never saw that email until I traveled to Juneau amny days later, heard rumors
          there was one, so Kelly and I did our own investigating of emails until we finally found
          it... and by then we were advised not to contact her as wheels were in motion . The ADN
          writes about this as if I purposefully ignored the accuser's offer to provide me more
          information . Megan further reports in a series of quesions on-line that I must be asked
          "why no response ", all based on PriVlle ed s email, and it's reported she had a follow up
          phone call to the gov's office and yet no response from me?

              We need    a statement on that - and again internally a strong reminder that recipients
          of volitile    emails like that must be forwarded to appropriate personnel . ( In fact, Mike,
          please do a    memo on that to all admin assistants ... this was a harsh lesson to have
          learned re :   receptionists needing to use discernment on forwarding significant emails that
          seem pretty    obvious to me they should be forwarded.)

             That one needs clarification be it could lead to potential legal trouble if it's
          assumed I received the accuser ' s email yet did nothing in response . ( This email evidently
          was forwarded to three different depts, I believe)
