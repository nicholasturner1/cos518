              Let the other side have space on the website for rebuttal. And I'll forgo my First Amendment

               Governor, attached below are Ed Fogel's quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right away. Ruth is
               already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to decide the right course of
               action.

               We still feel that DEC, Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


               To: Tom, Marty,

               The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several specific
               examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other election statutes, and
               a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the ballot measure should have some
               level of agreement to our website.

              The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website language that is
              mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that they find objectionable. We
              have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm tomorrow. the Commission will either
              then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

              The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state officials
              cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at 2:00. The
              Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.

              Ed
