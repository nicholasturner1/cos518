Commissioner:

Was thinking we could take the air out of psea's new ads by being proactive and sending a press
release out before their ads come out. If they're going to say you and the governor don't understand
the constitution we should say FIRST that the governor remains committed to constitutionally
madated services and that psea like other unions are receiving bettwr contracts than they've seen in
yrs. I'll finish looking over the constitution for you in the morning and get you some specifics for a
press release if you decide to go that route.
