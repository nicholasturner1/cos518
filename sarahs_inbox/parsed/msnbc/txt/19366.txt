         Sherry Whitstine's comment was flagged 3 times and still there as of last night. Looks
         like its finally removed as of now.



         It went up yesterday afternoon sometime.



         Unacceptable.     Disgusting.    Vindictive.



         I printed for Nizich who gave to Bob Cockrell as well.

         Ok dokay- enough is enough. I am calling ADN, as Todd just called from Dlg and

         said Sherry Whitstine (aka crazy hater) blogged yesterday that "Sarah had

         an affair with Todd's best friend while he was on the slope". No, I

         haven't read it- others have - it's flippin unbelievable that the ADN

         allows lies like this to be posted. I'm calling.
