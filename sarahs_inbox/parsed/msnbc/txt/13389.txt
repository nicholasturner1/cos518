            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your son, Trig. I am sure he will be a joy for you and
            your family.



            I am writing to you in support of SB 221. As one of the owners of Frontier Alaska and
            formerly Hageland Aviation, we have been a strong supporter of the Yuut-Yaqunguiat Flight
            Achool in Bethel.  As the operator of the largest 135 commuter airline in the United
            States we have a never ending need for pilots and mechanics. We have made a commitment
            and a guarantee to all graduates of the school, a job as a pilot or a mechanic. I think
            of it as a reward for the opportunity they have given themselves to be self-reliant as
            professional pilots and mechanics and to become role models for young people in rural
            Alaska.



            We have 15 native pilots in our workforce. Our chief pilot is a native from Mountain
            Village.  We need the flight school to continue because it is so integral to Frontier
            Alaska's goal of an all native workforce in the bush.



            Thank you for your support.



            James Tweto
