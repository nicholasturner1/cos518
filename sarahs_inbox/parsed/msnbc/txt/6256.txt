        We cant afford it, the Feds won't pay for it, the general populace isn't placing it as a
        high priority.., can you diplomatically express that?:   Of course we want infrastructure
        - and this is NOT a "bridge to nowhere" (that is so offensive), but as it stands today
        with the highest-cost bridge design selected by the Ketchikan community, we need to find a
        lower-cost alternative is a bridge will be built.

        Don't know if you are reading your BB during the cabinet meeting, but if I get a question
        from the audience at noon (Ketchikan Rotary) about the Ketchikan bridge. What's your
        current view?
