             Dear Governor Palin:



             Denali Kid Care is an important support for families and especially

             grandparents that are careing for their grandchildren. I encourage you to

             add this issue to the special session so these kids get a good start in

             life.



             Sincerely,




             Frank Appel

             907-338-2282
