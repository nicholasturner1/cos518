                 Subject: Lori ZaumseilMeeting

                P.S.
                I am meeting with President Hamilton of the University this morning to discuss his
                federal priorities and appropriations requests. Is there anything that you would like
                me to communicate in your behalf?

                Also, I didn't see a story by Robert Dillon on Congressional earmarks. I guess we
                have something else to look forward to.


                A woman named Lori Zaumseil, representing a group called Committee for Noxious
                and Invasive Plant Management (CNIPM), is here with several other Alaskans to
                meet with the Congressional delegation on pending legislation - the 100th Meridian
                bill. She heard that you were in town and wants her group to meet with you,
                possibly in the company of the delegation.

                We explained that your schedule is quite full and that you will be leaving town
                today, but she asked that we forward her request. If, as I suspect, this doesn't work
                for you, I would be glad to meet with the group.


                Please note that my email address has changed . My new email address is
                jwka      askadc.org. Thank you.
