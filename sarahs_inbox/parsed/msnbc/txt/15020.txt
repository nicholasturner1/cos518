            Dear Governor Palin,




            I am writing to ask that you please consider signing the budget with the Curry Ridge
            project intact. I have lived in Alaska my whole life, born in Anchorage, grew up in Eagle
            River, and moved to Girdwood to raise my own family 13 years ago. I have twin 12 year old
            daughters and a younger daughter, age 7. I have worked in the tourism industry in Alaska
            for over 14 years and it is important to so many Alaskan families to continue supporting
            the growth of the industry. With the main entrance to Denali Park so overcrowded and
            congested, I believe the Curry Ridge project is vital to sustaining the tourism industry.



            Congratulations to you and Todd on the birth of your new baby son.



            Thank you,

            Dawn Venters
