            Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to
            the citizens and get bills introduced in the state legislature in california florida and
            elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they should split the revenue stream
            with a specified amount (maybe half) going to the citizens as a direct benefit

             How much does each alaskan get?

             What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the
            citizens?

             Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?



             Would you be interested in writing or talking about this?

             Thanks

             Newt
