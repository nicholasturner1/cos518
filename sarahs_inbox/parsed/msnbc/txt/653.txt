  I did hear that Torgerson resigned fairly recently. This gives an opportunity for her to make a

     Its also hypocritical for her to keep attacking the
     ethical lapses of legislators while she is living in a
     glass house. She has kept all the Murkowski-appointed
     DOT people (except commissioner), including in
     Southeast Alaska, ignoring their conflicts of interest
     and misrepresentation of the facts.
