              Walt's initial information was incorrect. It is 87 working positions, and 9 vacancies for
              a total of 96. The Lt. Governor indicated he would work with Bruce on shortening up the
              data into one-liners.

             I need one-liners from these folks. Period. And the public safety info doesn't mesh with
             walt's info he gave you.
