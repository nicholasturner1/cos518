             I wasn't sure if you had talked with her directly, so.I just sent her an email asking her
             to head on over to the Capitol this morning to the B&C office.

              Annette- I need to borrow Ivy for just a bit so Boards and Commission can get caught up
            and forward names to Legislature for confirmation asap . I asked Ivy first , assuming she'd
            say she was game to help Frank on this - thankfully she does say " yay", so I would greatly
            appreciate your allowance of this . She's multi-talented and always so helpful ... thanks
            for understanding on this.

              Of course! Anything at all you need, I'm there. We'll get the confirmation letter
            cranked out.

                 Frank- if there ' s only a few days left to put names forward to leggies to fill b and c
              spots, do you want ivy to come help for a day or two? I haven't asked her yet, but knowing
              her (and Annette who'd be generous to help out by lending ivy) she'd be willing. I'm
              guessing.



                 Leggies aren't going to give us any breaks, so the sooner we get names in front of
              them, the better. They'll be looking for reasons to ding us this session.



                 This wk is packed with AML folks coming and going into my office, but I've tried to
              clear a big chunk of time to get b and c issues time to be addressed. Thanks
