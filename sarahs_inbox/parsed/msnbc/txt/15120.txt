            Subject:                Budget


            Megan - thank you for your good work with today's ADN article re: legislative budget
            requests. It's helpful for Alaskans to be made aware of what goes on with the odd way the
            legislature has always crafted budgets.



            Your article is probably an eye-opener for many folks who may not understand the need to
            scour the budget and keep asking questions about the 927 budget additions that were
            presented us by lawmakers. It's a tough task because it doesn't look like lawmakers said
            "no" to any request by anyone this year. At least this year, though, lawmakers have agreed
            to put their names on their requests (unlike years past when items were thrown in at the
            midnight hour without requiring explanation, not even requiring the requestor's name to be
            attached).



            Challenging to believe any aspect of lawmakers' budget when we hear some admit to
            stretching truth on individual line items. Our additional challenge here is to balance the
            need to veto with the legislature's threat (or promise) of veto override, considering the
            0MB resources required in this entire process: craft/crunch
            numbers/add/crunch/research/veto/crunch/override threat/crunch again...



            Your article is a great reminder for Alaskans - I know our budget people will appreciate
            the education it provided readers. Great research on your part! Thank you,

            Sarah
