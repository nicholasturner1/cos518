             Governor, I won't prolong this, but here is what I'd suggest.

             I would like to convene a conference call with Mike Tibbles, Mike Nizich, John
             Bitney, Larry, and me to discuss the current situation with PAC/West.

                OK, since the state is paying me to think and use my experience, I figure I might
                as well give my opinions until told otherwise.

                Tom Kizzia of A D N interviewed me for over an hour today on PAC West and the
                State's energy education effort.

                I did my best to focus Tom's attention on the reasons for an information
                campaign, the components of the effort, our basic messages, and the changed
                situation in Congress and its consequences for responsible oil and gas
                development. Tom kept coming back to PAC West. I reminded him that the PAC
                West contract came to us from the legislature, explained why such work is
                important to the total effort, described how their activities are supervised by us
                and the grant administrator, and told him that we insist on transparency and on
                a non political approach based on the merits.

                I refused to comment on PAC West's prior history, just on what they do for the
                State and mentioned that the Governor is opposed to sole source procurement's. I
                also indicated that with public funds involved, we hold our contractors to a very
                high standard and utilize State officials to do as much of the work as possible.
                Nevertheless, there is a need to spread Alaska's energy message beyond the
                Capital Beltway, as our opposition does on a regular basis.

                Tom said he called me, because this was suggested by other Administration
                Officials. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                However, if he quotes me accurately, I think things will come out alright.

                The story will probably appear on Friday. Just wanted you to know.
