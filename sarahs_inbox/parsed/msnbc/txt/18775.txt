        Governor,



        The team is working on the following draft agenda:



        The draft outline:

        I. Intro by GOV

        II. Where we've been

        III. Why ACES?

        IV. What legislators need from the administration to evaluate ACES

        V. General Q&A



        Except the introduction, Pat and Marcia will walk through the agenda.



        Regarding the Senate, Russ talked to Lyda Green and extended an invitation to hold a
        similar briefing for the Senate. Lyda did not see flying legislators to a briefing as a
        good use of resources prior to a bill being prepared. Russ will follow up today by
        sending Lyda an email offering to hold a group meeting if they desire. We will point out
        the House's interest in learning how we got to where we are and that we could do the same
        for the Senate prior to the bill being ready for distribution.



       Mike

          Pis let me know when you all know what tomorrow's aces agenda looks like.



         AP called asking about the preview/update tomorrow. Sharon and I told reporter it's not
         closed doors... also that COS has reached out to Senate Leadership offering the same, but
         so far no positive response




                                                       2
