           How can we let Alaskans know the significance of this? It's good news and it does benefit
           them.



           Also, is anything new on the idea (bad idea) of burning down the cabins/emergency shelters
           that are sitting on BLM lands throughout some parts of Alaska? I still hear questions on
           what I can do to stop it.

           Governor,   info if asked. The State has received over 3 million acres from the Feds in
           the last two years. Doesn't seem like too much for the size of Alaska but this is around
           the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. The 82,608 acres is in addition to what
           we have already received - this is the land within the TAPS Pipeline corridor in the
           Copper River Basin that was freed up through the discussions with BLM on their East Alaska
           Management Plan.   This 82,608 acres is not actually traversed by the pipeline, but to the
           east and west. Some is land in the Alaska Range (just west of the Delta River) that the
           mining folks are excited to get

            and the rest is near the Gulkana Glacier. - the home of the Arctic Man snow machine race.
             BLM and state people have been working hard on getting title to Alaska lands.



            The amount of land still owed the state is approx 11 million acres.



            BLM and the state have also had significant success in obtaining uncontested title for
           Alaska to numerous navigable waterways in Alaska through recordable disclaimers.

                                                                    1

            Governor ,  I don 't think you have to do anything but I have asked our Mine /Land/Water
           people to give us a summary of all BLM lands transferred to the state over the last couple
           of years .  I think it is now over 3-million acres .   I will get an update out tomorrow.
           God bless.   Tom
