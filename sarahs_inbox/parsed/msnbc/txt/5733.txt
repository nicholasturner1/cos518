              Subject: Lyman Hoffman Phone Call
             Since we thank Senator Hoffman in the SB82 press release, I spoke with Chris about the
             fact that I think it might be nice for the Governor to place a quick call rather than have him
             read about her appreciation in the media. I did pass along this thought to Christopher who
             was going to pass along to John. Don't know how busy everyone is - and so thought I'd jot
             this note as well. We'll send this release out in the next couple of minutes.

             Thanks,
             Meghan

                   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                        Governor Palin Thanks Anchorage Assembly for Unanimous Approval
                                               of AGIA Resolution


                   March 14, 2007, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today thanks the members
                   of the Anchorage Assembly for their unanimous approval last night of the AGIA
                   Resolution.

                   "Having the support of the Anchorage Assembly and Mayor Mark Begich means a
                   great deal as move the AGIA through the State Legislature," said Governor Palin. "It
                   is wonderful to see that everyone is just as anxious as I am to see a gasline built and
                   gas flowing sooner rather than later. We believe the AGIA is the right vehicle and
                   the support of the Anchorage Assembly and Mayor Mark Begich is deeply
                   appreciated."

                   The Resolution, sponsored by Assembly members Dick Traini and Allan Tesche,
                   passed unanimously Tuesday evening during its Assembly meeting.

                   Mayor Mark Begich applauds the Resolution and looks forward to more discussions
                   with the gasline team.

                   "Everyone recognizes the importance of the AGIA and moving our gas to market,"
                   said Mayor Mark Begich. "I find the AGIA very promising and the concept
                   encouraging . I look forward to more meetings with the Governor 's gasline team to
                   see how Anchorage fits into the AGIA as it moves through the process."

             I can't find the commercial fisheries blog, but perhaps it's going to start soon.
