           Hannah's last day will be approx. July 18 (Friday). She has not given official notice yet
           but has talked about this date. I would ask that if the person is located in the
           Anchorage office that before Hannah leaves we can make arrangements for the candidate to
           come down for 2-3 weeks for training or we send Hannah up to train them on the scheduling
           database.  Thanks, Janice

              Governor,
              Thought I'd put in my two cents while we still have the letter in our possession.
              The message / content was right on to begin with. I simply worked to tighten and
              strengthen the message.
