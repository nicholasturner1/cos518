          Governor Palin,




          I just thought I should tell you this interesting story. While I was a grenade range
          instructor down at ft.benning in 2007, I had noticed a young man come to my live grenade
          pit with the name of palin. So I made a smart remark of come on alaska lets through this
          next grenade. then i hesitated and asked him if he was any relation. He said he was your
          son. I was extremely proud to have your son come to my grenade pit! I respect you and your
          family highly for everything you have done for alaska. I was stationed in Fort Wainwright,
          AK for 3 years from 2004 to 2007 and I did vote for you. I just wanted to let you know
          that.
