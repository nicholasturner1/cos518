              Governor,

              Do you still want to consider Privile ed or Pe for the Human Rights Commission ? Privile said
              she would step down if you wanted her too, but did say she was interested in staying on HR and
              that the time commitment wasn 't so great that she couldn 't handle both HR and the Health
              Council . If you want to kee p Privil on than            could fill the vacancy ? I will still check with
              both Privile but I believe Privil is only looking for employment.
