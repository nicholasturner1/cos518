              Karen:

              I have a bit more information:

                 1. On the VPSO housing in Elim      $ 100,000 Watt called me back and said he has publicly o     sed state
                                          o in . Privile ed or Personal Material Redacted
                       Privileged or Personal Materia l Re dacted


                 2. On Alaska Judicial Observers ($54,000) According to Larry Cohn of the Alaska Judicial Council, this entity
                    is a non-profit Their mission is to train members of the community to observe how judges are acting and
                    handling their cases, and to report back to the Judicial Council . The Judicial Council then incorporates
                    some or all of their comments when forming their retention recommendations for judges . Larry said he
                    thought the non-profit was well run , had some civic service to it, and often uses semi-retired or retired
                       persons in the community. Privileged or Personal Material

                 3. On the several DOT items, Gordon Keith is out for 2 weeks and Frank is at the chiropractor. He is
                    supposed to call me when he gets back into the office.

              I will keep working the DOT items.

              Randy
