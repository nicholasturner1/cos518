            I know when security travels. The hotels are never put in your name. Yes if someone calls
            a hotel they let them know if a guest is registered when they ask specifically. We may
            want to not use your name when you travel without staff. Janice

             Wonder if it's common for hotels up here to give out info on who their guests are. No
            need for Melissa to contact Ruby tho, or there will just ne more bad blood between them. I
            was just curious how public my schedule is since once in awhile it pops up that folks know
            where I am

              Just landed. No . Me, janice and melissa and that ' s it as far as I know . I wouldn't be
             surprised if she called around to the hotels . I'll let melissa know . Melissa said she was
             in the office the other day wanting to know what your schedule was. She of course wouldn't
             give it to her and that was before you were booked at hotel.

              The front desk just called to say "Miss Ruby " stopped by here at SpringHill hotel to say
            hi... How does anyone know where I'm staying ? I'd go entertain her downstairs but am
            heading out , so if you hear anything you can let her (and anyone else know ) that I wasnt
            dissing her , just catching up on emails and other things this morning . Any idea how anyone
            would know where I stay tho?
