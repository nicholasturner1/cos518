          OK thanks, I will talk to Karen. Did you see how Begich is requesting an additional 20
          new officers in his budget? Interesting move on his part, knowing that 20 officers will
          have a significant impact the DA's, defense attorney (who are already requesting $2
          million), courts and prison beds. The article states that the Mayor's budget calls on the
          state to pay for projects such as $2 million for the Anchorage Golf Course and $4.4
          million for the Anchorage Museum. I guess he did not learn his lesson the first time.

         Karen and I have expressed that even if approved, we will not be able to do everything at
         once.  Shortly after the cabinet meeting, Karen's staff sent out an email to all
         commissioners requesting that they list their absolute must haves, prioritize those and
         show how those priorities can be phased in over 3 to 5 years. Walt was absent but his
         staff does have the instructions and should be working to meet our Oct 8 deadline to hear
         back from the agencies. We will have to prioritize his items along with everyone else.
