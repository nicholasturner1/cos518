             True. Bob Cockrell said he carried him all around the U.S., which means Mrs. Cowper got to
             travel with the Gov, unlike me where we're told Todd doesn't go unless it's an official
             First Gentleman duty. Odd that we're in a different boat.

            My friend Maren wrote with a correction: Wade Cowper was 4 mos old when Steve got in
            office.
