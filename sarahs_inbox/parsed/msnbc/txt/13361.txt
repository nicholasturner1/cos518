            Congratulations to all of you on the arrival of your precious little boy. It was
            refreshing to read of your gratitude in a God that would trust you with one of His special
            spirits. We so appreciate your family values and your support of life to each child of
            God. I know that much is expect of you and that you will still put your family first.
            Thanks for standing as a witness for us that value family, life and honesty. Your
            leadership is a breath of fresh air. May you continue to be guided by the Holy Spirit to
            be true to your values and to continue to love and support your family. We hope that all
            is going well and may Trig bring much love and laughter into your lives.



            Thanks so much and best wishes
