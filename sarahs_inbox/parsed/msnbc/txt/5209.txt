                 Thank you Governor.

                 The department will be approaching the upcoming meeting of the Board of Game in support of the
                 proposals to continue to keep the area around Douglas Head closed to hunting, so that these "McNeil"
                 bears will not be hunted there.

                 DL.

                 Don't know where the issue is, or came from on the McNeil bears... but my position hasn't
                 changed since i was last asked about it - i don't support a hunt that would kill the mcneil bears
                 that eventually end up in the sanctuary.

                 there are other places to hunt. and i say this as a hunter...
