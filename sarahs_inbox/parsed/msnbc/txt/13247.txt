             Am I hearing right on Fagan?. He is disspelling rumors about Trig and chastising hate
             mongers. Wow. Said the Governor's office is flooded with calls about rumors.

             Hate to pick at this one again, but have heard three different times today the rumor again
             the Bristol is pregnant or had this baby. Even at Trig's doc appt this morning his doc
             said that's out there (hopefully NOT in their medical community-world, but it's out
             there). Bristol called again this afternoon asking if there's anything we can do to stop
             this, as she received two girlfriend-type calls today asking if it were true. Sent from my

             Subject: channel 13 tonight Governor-     Do you mind if Channel 13 grabs a quick interview
             after the event tonight at Mears? We could have them set up in the parking lot as you are
