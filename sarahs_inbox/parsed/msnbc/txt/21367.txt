Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com      Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




              I am taking the liberty of e-mailing you because today is a state holiday and I assume
              your support staff is not working and so I could not be able to call you. I drafted most
              of this message before getting the order just issued by the court which orders us to do
              what I suggest below.




              This message is motivated by the filing you faxed to us at 4:08 pm last evening. As you
              can imagine my clients are very disappointed that the Lieutenant Governor has decided that
              he cannot comply with the court order.




               My clients believe that by a) delaying the decision to not certify the initiative until
              virtually the last day of the 60 days allowed, b) refusing to agree to our proposed time
              for filing his answer, c) seeking additional time to respond to our motion for summary
              judgment (which we agreed to) d) taking virtually the entire 60 days to address 07WTR2,
              e) the ongoing delay in addressing the validity of 07WTR3 which was revised to
              accommodate the states concerns, f) the failure of the state to object to the five day
              period we had in our proposed order g) the failure to take any action for two days after
              the court order was received, and h) the insistence that the petitions cannot be made
              available until the 29th of this month at the earliest, that the Lt. Governor has
              deliberately and intentionally delayed any approval of a ballot measure which might
              be related to large scale mining in Alaska for policy or political reasons.    They feel he
              is trying to keep the people from having the opportunity to vote on such a measure.    And
              they feel at this point that he has admitted he is in contempt of court. They have
              instructed us to seek an order to show cause and to compel sanctions. They are also
              exploring other methods to communicate their considerable frustration.




             Given the dates on the Division of Elections web page showing that petition books for
             numerous other initiatives have been provided in much less than 17 days they do not
             believe that 17 days should be necessary. The specific procedures outlined in the
             statutes and regulations do not require that much time. The drafting of a summary and the
             preparation of a cost estimate should not take long. While petition books have to be
             printed we believe that would it would not take 5 calendar days to get those printed.
             Indeed experts in printing we have consulted with think that numerous print shops could
             produce at least 100 booklets overnight.  And I note that the rules permit the applicants
             to pay for additional booklets to be printed if they think the Lt. Gov. has not provided
       I     enough.




             I am contacting you to explore the possibility of resolving this short of us asking the
             court to hold Mr.. Parnell in contempt and that significant fines and other sanctions be
             imposed.
                                                          6




                                                                                                      PRA_GSPOI_0006858

              It would seem that with a few hours of concentrated effort by the Division of Elections,
              the summary and the cost estimate could be completed.    The layout of the booklet should
              take only a few more hours.  Printing could be started and the first several hundred
              booklets should be available within in a day after that.    Alternatively perhaps agreement
              could be reached on interim booklets that could be copied on copy machines and could be
              used to gather signatures before the final booklets are printed. It does not seem that we
              need to engage in a huge legal battle if a bit of cooperation could resolve the timing
              issues .  It may require a bit of flexibility on the part of the state and officials of
              the Division of Elections. But it does not appear that there are specific time frames in
              statute or other similar legal requirements that must be observed at the risk of
              challenges from others.




              In short I urge you in the strongest possible terms to get with your client and his staff
              in the Division of Elections and come up with a way that can accelerate this process and
              avoid the delay which you are now proposing and which is unacceptable to my clients. My
              clients may even be willing to help cover some of the costs if it means they do not have
              to pay me to pursue expensive litigation against the state.




             Can I hear from you no later than 10 am tomorrow? If we do not have a solution in place
             by noon tomorrow or very significant progress towards a solution, I am instructed to file
             a motion for order to show cause and to ask for significant financial and other sanctions.
