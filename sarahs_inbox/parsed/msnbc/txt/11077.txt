             Governor:




             It's the supervisors' union and the ad was an illustration that

             indicated that supervisors' jobs are a "bridge to nowhere."



             It's part of the union campaign to gain sympathy for the ongoing

             contract negotiations/dispute.

             Juneau Empire yesterday re: "Gov. Palin' s Bridge to Nowhere".

             I've got a call in to the CoS. And, we had discussed something like

             this happening, so should be able to make it work.

             Thanks!
