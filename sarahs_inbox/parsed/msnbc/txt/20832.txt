              A very close friend of mine , Steve Muhic, was a boat owner/captain in Alaska several years ago and Todd Palin
              was a crew member on Steve's gillnet boat.
              Steve was seriously injured in a surfing accident in Virginia on Monday . He is recovering well in the Peninsula
              Regional Medical Center in Salisbury MD.
              Steve has always spoken very highly of Todd and his family. He has shared several stories about their fishing
              trips. I thought Todd would like to know of Steve 's condition.
              If there is any way to pass along this information to Todd, please let him know Steve is recovering and should be
              back to full strength in a week or two.
              If Todd would like to contact Steve, the hospital phone number is 410.546.6400.
