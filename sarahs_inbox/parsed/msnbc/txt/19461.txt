          Dear Gov. Hickel,     Mr. Roberts, and BackBone, et al.:



          As you have all failed to respond to my 24 hour deadline to not use my name in any
          advertising you are undertaking under the names of "BBIII", "BBII", "BBI", "Backbone", or
          any other entity under your control, this email is to give written notice that tomorrow,
          Monday, July 14, 2008, I will be retaining legal representation regarding the use of my
          name in your advertising. My name is not to be used in current, planned, or unpublished
          advertising of any entity of Backbone.



          Yesterday, I clearly asked you to not use my name in any Backbone advertising, and since I
          have had no response from anyone associated with Backbone regarding this issue, my only
          conclusion is that you still plan to use my name, despite my continued requests to stop
          and decease from using my name, associated with any advertising by Backbone and its
          subsidiaries.



          I have also not received any apology.



          Sincerely,.
                                                                 1




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01_0020811
