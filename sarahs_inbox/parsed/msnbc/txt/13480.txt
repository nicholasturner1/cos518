           Dear Governor Palin,

           I don't know if you ever get the occasion to watch the Glenn Beck show on tv, but he had
           some things to say about you today. Very nice things about the birth of Trig, the comments
           you made about the blessing you have been given. It was nice to see someone from so far
           away, be aware of what is happening here, and he gave you high praise in the mother
           department, and also on your duties as Governor. Congratulations were sent your way. Just
           thought you would like to know this, incase you were not aware.

           Sincerely,

           Donna J Prewitt
