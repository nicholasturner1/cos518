           MESSAGE:

           Dear Sarah,

           Though we moved from Alaska in November to care for our parents. our hearts remain in the
           land of the north. Congratulations on the birth of your son, Trig and his good health.
           We are both so proud of you and Todd for your consistent parenting of your children,
           regardless of the needs of each one. We are praying for you both as you adjust to a
           newborn and juggle the needs of the people with the needs in your home. Keep pressing
           into Jesus, no matter what. He will always be enough.



           Sincerely,

           Patty and John Barsalou
