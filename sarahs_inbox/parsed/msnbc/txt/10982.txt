              No, despite what the paper said today, I would not be intersted in raising funds for Lyda,
              or Samuels, or Hawker... or other elected officials.



              One "loan-of-my-name" was enough with Gene Therriault's request (the only request I've
              received to loan my name - from any leggie, R or D).

              Just fyi.
