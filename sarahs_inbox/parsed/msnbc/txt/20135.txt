          So far, here ' s the only quote I have been able to find:



          From Obama's " New Energy for America " plan, at

          http: //www.barackobama.com/pdf / factsheet_energy_speech- 080308. pdf



          "Prioritize the Construction of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline.             As

         president, Obama will work with the Canadian government , state of

          Alaska , oil and gas producers ,     and other stakeholders to facilitate

          construction of the pipeline . While this pipeline was proposed in 1976,

          and Congress authorized up to $ 18 billion in loan guarantees for this

          project in

          2004, there has been no progress in building this critical energy

          infrastructure under the Bush Administration . The planned pipeline would

          have a daily capacity of 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or almost

          7 percent of current U.S. consumption . Not only is this pipeline

          critical to our energy security , it will create thousands of new jobs."



         This isn't much to respond to, but I will keep scouring the net.




         Joe

          I've been monitoring the 'net to see what he says today            ( TC folks have

          been working on his campaign people and . were hoping / expecting him to say

          something positive about the Legislature ' s action).



          I'm on it.

          He gave a great speech this morn in Michigan - mentioned Alaska .. Stole

          out Energy Rebate $ 1000 check idea , stole our TC-Alaska gasline talking

          points, etc. So.... we need to take advantage of this a write a

          statement saying he ' s right on .   ( Glad he's flipflopping on OCS, too.)

          Joe- could you help crank this quick statement out as our            "reaction" to

          some of Obama ' s good points this morning?
