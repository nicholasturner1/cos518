           Thank you. I'd think that after he thinks about it he'll be enthused about access to
           resources , job creation and diversifying Western AK economies.

           He said that he can't recall any comments by = him on East-West corridors since
           Congressional consideration of ANILCA.&nbs= p; However, he promised to think about the
           issue and to get back to me = after he returns to DC.

               When did she ask? We've been here at the house...
               Did you formulate a statement for her yet, based on this email and the other one of mine and Randy's?
               Who is responding?

               Governor, I did not say anything without being able to run it by you first. I just talked to her and she said she can
               give us 45 minutes to get her a statement. So it is not too late.

               Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re: the number of meetings I've had w Walt, and his claim that it was only four.
                I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone call and face-to-face that I had with
                Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                 Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                 Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER
               refused any request to meet with any of us. He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in
               "communications " with me.
                Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.
               And pis pass on the Bill McA. What 's his email addy?
                 Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points . Thanks
