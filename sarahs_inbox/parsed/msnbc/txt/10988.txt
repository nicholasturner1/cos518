                                 The Alaska contemporary Art Bank Is pleased to highlight a selected artwork
                                 from the Art Bank's Collection. This oil painting by UAA Art Professor Garry
                                 Kaulltz Is called "Future Legacies' and was commissioned by then Governor
                                 Knowles to celebrate Alaska 's role In the new millennium . According to the
                                 records on the piece:
                                 The painting uses symbolism to embody Alaska 's past, present and future. The
                                 past Is represented by a pair of traditional Native dancers, the present by the oil
                                 pipeline, and the future In the snapshots painted as though they are taped onto
                                 the canvas . Past, present and future are all set against the one thing that has
                                 and never will change about Alaska : It's wild beauty that serves as the
                                 backdrop for the painting.


                                 Garry teaches printmaking and drawing at UAA, and many of his pieces feature
                                 trompe I'oell' (fool the eye ) technique where skilled painting and drawing make
                                 objects appear to be three-dimensional or layered.
                                 This painting was recently selected for hanging In Judge Morse 's courtroom.

                                 Keep your eyes on television reports - you are likely to see this and other
                                 selections in the background of news stories!
