          <file :/// C:/adn / node / 109441#comment - 41502> Don Young helped Lisa funnel money to her road

        Where is this story on ADN ?? And why does AlaskaReport . com always have it before ADN?

          <http :// alaskareport . com/news / z46514_lisa_crime . htm> The latest Lisa Murkowski scandal

        Republican Murkowski funneled money to road for her home

        August 8, 2007

        Anchorage , Alaska - Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has secured $6 million in
        federal funds to build a road leading straight to a plot of land she bought - but was
        forced to sell - after being exposed July 16th by the TPMmuckraker website.

        An August 7th article by Laura McGann and Paul Kiel at TPM , also says that her father,
        Alaska ex - governor Frank Murkowski , diverted $ 325,000 of state money while he was in
        office to her road.

        From TPM - Sen . Ted Stevens ( R-AK) and Rep. Don Young ( R-AK) rounded up an extra $2
        million for the three - mile road project, which is just under half mile from Murkowski's
        plot , which she sold back to Penney in the wake of the controversy.

        And even that's not all . To cover matching costs required by some of the federal money,
        Murkowski's father, then - Gov. Frank Murkowksi ponied up another $325,000 in state funds.
        It's unclear whether the project , construction for which is set to begin next year, will
        boost the value of the land.
