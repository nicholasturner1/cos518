             Hello , bummer about the deployment cancellation !! We'll take care of the Tbed & the
             fruit!   I think you'll like it up there and if not- the spot in your office where that big
             armoire used to be might be good .  I'll keep my ears & eyes open for a treadmill.

              Hmmm- not good. This is the reason I flew to Anchorage, missing more of the special
              session , and it's what I told reporters yest. I'll turn around from my trip into kulis and
              head for the Anchorage office instead.

              Governor - I just spoke with McHugh Pierre. The deployment that we had on your schedule
              for 10:00 a.m. today happened yesterday morning. There was no ceremony - it was just a
              handful that deployed for 45 days. Apparently it was continuation of group that went out
              Sunday evening (Lt. Gov) attended that one. Sorry for any inconvenience. Janice
