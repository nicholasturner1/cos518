             Mike:



             We have received notice that the 168th Air Refueling Wing (Eielson AFB)

             security police unit is being involuntarily mobilized for a one year tour in

             Central Command starting this June. It will include approximately 35 of our

             cops.      Location is classified.       Please advise Governor Palin of this

             involuntary mobilization order.



             Maj Gen Campbell
