              Governor,

             There is a hearing tomorrow on the unemployment insurance bill. The bill proposes to raise the average weekly
             unemployment benefit from $248 to $370. Alaska 's unemployment insurance rates rank 48th lowest in the nation.
             The new amount if enacted would place Alaska in the middle of the pack . There have been numerous attempts
             over the years to adjust the rates but the unions and the business community have not been able to reach an
             agreement.

             The bill has picked up more momentum this year . It may be due to the recent announcement about the employer
             rates being reduced and the lowest in many years . The current version of the bill would increase the amount of
             the employer paid insurance from $470 per employee per year in 2008 to $495 per employee per year in 2014.
             The net increase for employers would be $25 over 6 years . The 2014 amount at $495 is still lower than the $584
             amount last year. The employee costs will remain flat for two years but will result in a $34 increase over 6 years.

             The state chamber and the associated general contractors support the bill. They believe higher unemployment
             insurance will help with the high cost of livin and result in a strop er workforce by maintaining workers to fill
             seasonal jobs . Comm[ i       r BishoprPrivilenpri or Pprrnn:;f k4a date has been neutral in his comments t
