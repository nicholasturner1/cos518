            Since one reporter asked ,     I think we need to do a press statement -short

            and sweet- to go out to all (including AP) re: reaction to Bush's push

            for ANWR today. The statement Sharon sent to me will do well for press

            statement. This shouldn't take long and can make it in by the evening

            news and AP and ADN print deadlines. Thanks
