         Sounds good, Governor.        We have a letter ready to go out today. Mike

         and Joe have been working on it, and we have a version ready for you to

         look at.    I'll get with Kris on scheduling a time to get everyone

         together with you.



         - Pat

        Subject: Sp session



        Hi Pat, et al:

        I'll need to definitively respond to sp session questions today. Folks

        know that I've returned from overseas trip and I'd told them they'd hear

        from me upon that return. This includes a few leggies, and the four or

        five reporters whom I've spoken with over the weekend. I told them all

        that, yes, I'd be calling it - we'd get an official statement out asap

        (we need to do this today - it's impossible and not fair to Alaskans to

        put off the statement any longer). I'll be in the Anchorage office in an

        hr if folks want to meet in person or via tele on this issue.



        Mr. Nizich- any info on logisitics if, when working w/leggies, the

        locale is chosen along the road system? That's another question Bill

        mcAllister has been asking and waiting for answer re: location. I've let

        him and other reporters know that the Juneau office has been working on

        this. If i need to shift from that, pls let me know as we have an

        Anchorage office of staffers who are offering, enthusiastically, to work

        on logistics to present location ideas to leg leaders. They want to do

        this, so if there's too much on the Juneau plate pls let me know be the

        Anchorage staff wants to work on this aspect of sp session.



        Thanks!

        Kris- in response to the negative letter to the editor in todays adn re:

        military picnic: i'll pen a response to that, so pls have whomever

        organized it or chose the theme to send a quick email on the purpose or

        thought that went into them choosing the theme. Cant believe someone

        could turn that one into a negative.



        Also- did u guys get the email i sent yest on my way to Alfred Creek?

        Sent it on the rd, hopefully it was recvd by all of you - any kind of "i

        got it" would be great and then i won't follow up with other recepients

        until this afternoon.



        Mike- any thoughts on leg liason ? If, still, my idea on who it could be

        isnt going antwhere then we need to hustle on plan B.



        Remember i'll be gone to pick up willow in orgeon and spend time with

        family aug 10-20.
