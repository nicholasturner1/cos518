             For ached: the ANCSA mtg wasn't a 15-min call in... They had questions of my until I
             finally had to cut them off (hope they're not offended) at 10:20.

             Pls note on sched. And hopefully this didn't put me too far behind on getting intro ready
             for next speech!
