               ... at Costco yesterday, Gov.Palin... Sure made my day. Congratulations again to you and your family on
               your new bundle of joy, Trig.
               He is a fortunate son to have such a cool mom and vice versa ... but I bet you and the First Dude already
               knew that!
               It is such a gift to work for someone that is in tune with a strong sense of ethics . I don't always agree with
               you, but I do believe you do what's right.
               You've a pulse on our state and our people

               Thank you for honoring for the past, living and leading us in the present, and creating our future.


               (... the pizza eating nurse that handed you a business card).
