           Hi Ivy: I've talked with Barb and reviewed the materials. I think I'd have a conflict in that still I need about 4
           months of State employment to complete my qualification for my State Tier one retirement. I have to get those
           approximately four months in before 2010. If I took one of the positions you have kindly offered, it would probably
           require me to leave the appointed position early so I could get those four months or so completed. I wouldn't
           want to start something and then leave before any term was
           up. So I'd better decline with appreciation that you thought of me. Give my best to Sarah. WA

           Hi WAR,

           I wanted to follow up with you to see if you were interested in the attorney seat on the Privileged or Perso . I will
           be going over recommendations with Governor Palin on Friday.
           Thanks so much for your consideration.

           Best regards,

           Ivy

          WAR,

          I attached the fact sheet for the Privileged or Personal Material Red It should answer all of your questions.

          I also wanted you to know there is a vacancy on the Privileged or Perso that is restricted to an attorney.
          Perhaps you would be more interested in that board? I've attached both fact sheets so you can decide which
          may be the better fit for you.

          Thanks,
