              At issue is the lawsuit over the Alaskan Grown logo. State claims ownership of the logo -
              the Mat-Su chapter of the Alaska Farm Bureau tried to get a federal patent for it. Here
              is an article and an editorial from the Frontiersman that gives the history-




              The question is at the heart of a lawsuit between the Alaska Department of Agriculture and
              the Mat-Su Chapter of the Alaska Farm Bureau. in a court decision handed down Monday, a
              judge found the state would suffer irreparable harm if the Mat-Su chapter proceeded with
              its attempt to get a federal trademark on the Alaska Grown logo.



              The lawsuit began in February 2006 and this week's injuction came just days before the
              Alaska State Fair, where the Mat-Su Chapter of the Alaska Farm Bureau has a booth selling
              items emblazoned with the Alaska Grown logo.



              The Alaska Grown program was started in 1986, according to the Alaska Grown Web site. Its
              logo was a creation of the Alaska Division of Agriculture and the Alaska Farmers and
              Stockgrowers Association . The Stockgrowers Association became the Alaska Farm Bureau. The
              logo is both a marketing tool and a certification mark that indicates food bearing the
              logo is produced by farmers who are a part of the program. Sweatshirts and stickers with
              the logo are marketing tools and so are not required to be produced in Alaska.




             The farm marketing industry in Alaska is a $52 million business and Assistant Attorney
             General Steven Ross said that historically the state has allowed nonprofit farm
             organizations to use the logo for promotional purposes. The logo is used primarily on
             clothing the organizations sell and use for fundraising.



             The state's position is that the state owns the Alaska Grown logo, Ross said. That means
             the Mat-Su Farm Bureau chapter cannot trademark what the state owns.



             "It is a symbol of the Alaska Grown Program," Ross said, adding the Alaska Grown system
             was in place for nearly 20 years without problem.



             Ross said the issue began in 2005 when the Mat-Su chapter tried to register the logo with
             the federal patent office.



             The state asked representatives of the Mat-Su chapter to withdraw the federal trademark
             attempt and the Mat-Su Chapter refused, Ross said. The logo is registered with the state,
             but not at the federal level. If the Mat-Su federally trademarked the logo the state could
             loose control of how the logo is used.



             "The state has rights in that logo and it has to protect the other people involved in the
             Alaska Grown program, " Ross said.

              The state has terminated the right for the Mat-Su Chapter to use the Alaska Grown logo and
              Monday's court finding grants a motion for injunctive relief, which is what the state
              requested, Ross said.




              Politicians play dodgeball as ag industry bleeds




              Published on Thursday, October 11, 2007 10:00 PM AKDT




              The state and Mat-Su Chapter of the Alaska Farm Bureau seem no closer to settling a
              lawsuit hobbling an already shaky agriculture industry.



              The Alaska Grown logo - the familiar, friendly green, yellow and blue emblem - should be
              fused to a large playground ball as every politician in the state is playing dodgeball
              with it.



              The issue is ownership of the logo - who can use and profit from its use.

              Advertisement



              Few people outside the ag industry seem to understand the fierce tug-of-war over the logo.
              It's not surprising. There's been plenty of misinformation and accusations flying around.



              There is also some agreement.



              In the 1980s , a group of Alaska farmers and ranchers , and employees from various state and
              federal agencies , met to brainstorm ways to promote Alaska agriculture . Out of that
              meeting came the Alaska Grown logo , trademarked in 1985.



              The agreement ends there.



              Some say the state was chosen as caretaker of the logo. It was the state ' s job to ensure
              farm products bearing the logo are indeed Alaska grown . Some say the state was granted the
              logo itself. The state's lawsuit was filed after-the Mat-Su Farm Bureau chapter applied
              for federal trademark rights to the logo. While this incensed folks at the state Division
              of Agriculture, the Farm Bureau group argues it only made the application when the
              division failed to police knock-offs of the logo. A division representative has denied
              that charge, 'claiming the chapter was impatient in its demands, and the state was dealing
              with illegal distributors.



              At stake is a tidy sum of money earned - and I do mean earned - by the Mat - Su chapter and
              future income based on sales of non - food items bearing the logo.
                                                            4




                                                                                                      PRA_GSPO1_0006771
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com       Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




              When I say "tidy," that's by modest standards. Mat-Su Farm Bureau brought in a          record
              gross profit of more than $65,000 at the recent Alaska State Fair in Palmer. A          recent
              injunction forced the Farm Bureau chapter to turn over its profits because the          chapter is
              allegedly making money on a logo it does not own. Instead, the state thinks it          should have
              money it did not earn.



              Despite some posturing and the trademark application, the Alaska Farm Bureau makes no
              particular claim on the Alaska Grown logo. The Mat-Su chapter maintains it has the same
              claim to the logo as any of the other farm groups in the state. Its purpose for filing for
              the trademark was to protect the logo from those who would profit from it. The chapter is
              a nonprofit and uses funds earned to benefit the industry. it sells Alaska Grown T-shirts
              and sweatshirts to raise money for agricultural marketing efforts, farmland preservation,
              agricultural literacy and scholarships.



              Even folks at the Division of Agriculture would tell you the state spends less than it
              would like for ag marketing and education.



              It makes sense for the state to ensure any other use of the logo is restricted to that
              which promotes Alaska agriculture. It doesn't make sense for the state, through endless
              legal wrangling, to financially crush a farm organization that has been working hard -
              perhaps harder than the state itself - to promote local agriculture. It is
              counterproductive to a struggling industry and smacks of vindictiveness.



              The state has wasted thousands of dollars it could have used to promote agriculture, help
              the dairy industry or bolster agricultural literacy. The chapter has spent thousands of
              dollars it could ill afford and is threatened with loss of it profits from the Alaska
              Grown sales for years past - money already spent on the promotion of agriculture and
              defense of the lawsuit.



              In the face of this travesty , the politicians - from the governor on down - dodge the
              ball , letting lawyers pass it back and forth instead of intervening with a just and
              reasonable solution outside the courtroom . Without such intervention , this wanton waste of
              resources will become another of the disasters that have plagued Alaska ' s agriculture.

             Dear Governor Palin,

                        I am sorry to see this happening.

                    This is a case where I had to remove myself from participation .  My cousin, Mark
             Rempel, is a farmer and involved in the lawsuit. So, due to the conflict, I delegated all
             of my authority to Mr. Tillery. The attorney Tillery assigned to actually working the
             case for the state of Alaska is a Mr . Steve Ross in our Anchorage office . If you, or
             anyone from your office needs to talk about the legal status, details or policy decisions
             behind the case they should call Mr. Ross at 269-5278. I cannot be directly involved in
             this matter because of the conflict.

               State works against farmers




                Published on Thursday, October 18, 2007 10:27 PM AKDT

              This is a message to Gov. Sarah Palin.




               Your picture appeared on the front page of the Anchorage Daily News Oct. 15. You were
              wearing the Alaska Grown patch, sporting the logo you are suing the farmers for.



               While supporting more tax on oil and gas, you are suing the farmers who produce a
              sustainable product for the state. Not only are the farmers being sued for their interest
              in promoting Alaska Grown, but you recently appointed Franci Havemeister as director to
              the Division of Agriculture. The only qualification she brought to the job was that she
              was your high school buddy. You passed up many more qualified people to choose her.




              I thought the last administration was bad about appointing good of boys. Is it good of
              girls now? Franci didn't even know what the Plant Materials Center was when she became
              director, and I notice that you have zeroed.the Plant Materials Center out of the budget
              for next year. It happens to be the single most important source of quality seed stock in
              the state and the single most important resource for farmers.



               Wow, you really know how to cripple the farming industry in this state! Suppose you
              "win" the lawsuit against the farmers who have done so much to support Alaska Grown and
              make it popular. Without help and support from the farmers, the logo will probably wither
              and die because we will promote something else and make it popular too. What a shame! I
              can't wait for the public to learn that the Division of Agriculture has sent and received
              45,000 a - mails condemning or concerning Alaska Grown.



              Matanuska Maid and the state are directly responsible 100 percent for the failure of
             dairy farmers at Point MacKenzie.. Yet you spend hundreds of thousands of state dollars to
             save Mat Maid, even though it is selling mostly Outside milk. I hope that you wear your
             logo with pride, as you have already caused Alaska farmers much grief with your lawsuit.
             You can't strong - arm us if we choose to abandon the promotion of Alaska Grown , and the
             logo won't be the same even if you do "win" the lawsuit. The agricultural community has
             already suffered losses of about $100,000 in legal fees to defend the logo. That amount
             makes the division's efforts even smaller because the Division of Agriculture has done
             nothing for farmers, nor do I expect it ever to with the contentious climate that now
             exists.
