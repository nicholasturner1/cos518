       Chuck:  Yes - we need this task force. We're in a cabinet mtg right now discussing the
       topic. Have Joe Austerman get thinking on this - I just cleared his participation with
       Commissioner Notti.



       Mike Tibbles will be in charge. Let him talk to you about it and some of the other plans
       we have for revitalization/changes within Ag. (And MatMaid.). This will be awesome!

       Stand by for Tibbles and Kris Perry to contact you with directives.



                                                                   1

        You have my blessing and THANKS for being concerned and energized and excited about
        finding solutions.



        I'm ccing Cabinet members be their areas are also affected by the MatMaid issue and just
        wanted to let them know we're off and running with the task force idea . Ccing Franci, too,
        so she'll be a part of it.

        You don't have to respond to this entire list.



        Also, intriguing idea(s) from Kaladi Bros guys re: local product they tried to get MatMaid
        to hear them on months ago.

        Sarah,



        Joey and I stayed and talked with Bob Havemeister

        after the rally about potential solutions. We'd like

        to form a steering committee which would include dairy

        farmers, businessmen, and key state people, to come up

        with a viable strategy. Bob is all for downsizing and

        getting back to basics. Do we have your blessing to
                                                        2
