            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            Our prayers are with you as you govern our state and deal with the homefront, including
            your new baby. Congratulations on the safe arrival of Trig.



            I'm actually writing about Senate Bill 221. I am asking that you allow the appropriations
            for the Copper Valley Electric Association to remain
