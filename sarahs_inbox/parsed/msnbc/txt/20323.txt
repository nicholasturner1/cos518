          Arrive the day before first speech, leave day after last speech, stay at free hotel two
          nights, the other nights at state-sponsored hotel.

          Just talked with the MN Convention. They will be able to confirm speech date/time in
          approx. 48 hours. They do think that it will be on Wed., 09.03).   They have offered to
          cover your airfare as soon as they receive flight confirmation on flights. They have
          offered to cover 2 nights (night before speech and night after speech) at the Hilton
          Garden Inn.  They will provide 2 rooms.



          We do have you booked at the Ramada Inn as that is where the Alaska Delegation will be
          staying.  You have a speech on Tuesday, 09.02.08 which means we need to get you in that
          morning to have the hotel expense covered for Tues., Wed., and check out on Thursday for
          flight home 09.04.08.  Janice
