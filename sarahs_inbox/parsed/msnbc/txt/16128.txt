            Have had you in much prayer since we were together in

            March .     Am sitll in awe of how God works things out.



            I understand my boss , Ron Peck , was at the world Trade

            awards luncheon recently and got a few moments to

            speak with you about the signing of HB147. How

            exciting to have a media event associated with the

            signing.



            How is sweet little Trig doing? My granddaughter is

            getting ready to turn two , and I remember being there

            for her birth .      What a precious time .     The dance

            ministry that I am in have been keeping you , Trig in

            prayer .     God has placed the two of you deeply on their

            hearts ,    for which I am grateful as it joins with mine.




            I am forwarding an email from Mary Glazier of

            Windwalkers .       She and her global team are going to

            Japan July 2-11 for the G-8 meetings adn Japanese

            Prayer Convocation .       She has requested the following:

            > I'd like to contact Governor Sarah Palin .regarding

            > our state sending a greeting and/or a gift to cement

            > this diplomatic time which will precede the meeting

            > of the eight leaders of the industrialized nations

            > (G-8).      Can you put me in contact with Governor

            > Palin?

            I respect your privacy , so rather that just give her

            your email , have forwarded you her email .          I heard

            that you would be speaking at Mary's conference in

            October .    Wow!    Am checking my schedule , and I believe

            it is the week after the ATIA convention ,          so I should

            be able to make some of it !       Mary's email is

            maglazier @msn.com.
                                                                   2

           My dear friend Nancy Haney and team just got back from

           a 7 week ministry trip to Hong Kong, India and China.

           She was in China when the earthquake occurred, however

           with only minor detours to the ministy plan. I have

           gotten a few amazing written reports, but am looking
    I
           forward to hearing first hand how God's hand was at

           work every step of their journey.



           It is so amazing to take a step back and see the bits

           and pieces were God is at work and contemplating how

           they may fit together. Knowing that He will complete

           the picture that we only see in part.



           This has been more lengthy than I anticipated and

           assume your time is at premium. May God continue to

           pour into you his grace, mercy and wisdom for these

           days ahead.     May the Holy Spirit fill you to

           overflowing and be the conduit that gives you direct

           communication with our Heavenly Father.     May you rest

           in and draw stength from Him, the Alpha and Omega.

           In the name of Jesus .... Amen




           In His Service,

           Cheryl Fullerton
