Hey Kate,



I'm a current pilot. I've got two uncles who are pilots, not sure if their current.My grandfather had rare
J3 Piper Cub back in the early forty's in Bristol Bay.



Sarah said she doesn't need to include any of my family members who are pilots in her speech for
tomorrow.



Thanks Todd

Good morning, Todd!



I'm putting finishing touches on remarks for the Gov's Capstone bill signing tomorrow, and I was
going to add in that you are a pilot. I just wanted to make sure that info was still current, and check to
see if either you or the Governor have any other extended family who are pilots? Please let me know
when you can. Thanks so much for your help!
