            You better take a look at this. Document is attached. I'm pasting in the text below:

            J



            STIPULATION




                        Plaintiffs argue that the Clean Water Initiative (Ballot Initiative 07WATR)
            would eliminate large-scale mining.

                        The Sponsors of the Clean Water Initiative do not believe that the initiative
            would eliminate large-scale mining, nor do they intend it to have that effect.

                        To eliminate concerns that have been raised with respect to subsection 2(c) of
            the initiative, the parties stipulate that subsection 2(c) of the initiative shall be
            severed and removed from Ballot Initiative 07WATR.

           Counsel--

           I spoke with Howard Trickey today and advised that the initiative sponsors would be
           willing to stipulate that subsection 2(c) be severed and deleted from Ballot Initiative
           07WATR.  A stipulation to that effect is attached to this email. Please advise if your
           clients would be willing to enter into this stipulation.

           This proposal is offered pursuant to and is governed by Evidence Rule 408.
                                                            2




                                                                                                        PRA GSP01_0011706
