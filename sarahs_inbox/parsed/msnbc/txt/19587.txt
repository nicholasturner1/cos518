             Governor Palin Releases Statement




             July 17, 2008, Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today released the following
             statement regarding allegations that she acted improperly.




            "As governor , I expect a certain amount of criticism . When I took the oath of office, I
            even encouraged Alaskans to ask me questions , to hold me accountable. But some critics
            have taken this to ridiculous extremes that threaten to distract from the vital business
            currently facing the state and its residents.




            "To allege that I , or any member of my family , requested , received or released
            confidential personnel information on an Alaska State Trooper, or directed disciplinary
            action be taken against any employee of the Department of Public Safety, is, quite simply,
            outrageous . Any information regarding personnel records came from the trooper himself. I
            question the timing of these false allegations . It is unfortunate , as we seek to address a
            growing energy crisis in this state , that this matter has been raised now.




            "I do not interfere with the day - to-day operations of any department . Former Commissioner
            Monegan was not released due to any actions or inaction related to personnel issues in his
            department . We had hoped the former commissioner would have stayed in state service to
            help fight alcohol-related crime. We offered him the position of executive director of the
            Alcoholic Beverage Control board and , unfortunately , he turned it down.




            " I have and will continue to support our line troopers . They have my utmost respect.
            Since taking office, I have proposed to the legislature millions of dollars in budget
            increases for more troopers , equipment and training . My administration just completed
            contract negotiations providing increased wages and other benefits.




            "Nothing will distract me from improving public safety.      Commissioner Kopp shares my

            vision for filling vacant positions and reducing crime across the state.




            "The Department of Public Safety is a professional organization. We have good men and
            women protecting our families . Troopers are our first line of defense and will always
            have my full support-"
