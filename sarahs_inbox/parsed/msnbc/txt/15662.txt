            Subject: Confidential - Draft response to Juneau delegation - energy issues



            Governor:



            A draft response to the Juneau delegation's letters from May 5 and May 20 is attached. If
            everyone could get me edits I will try to final the letter and get it into proofing
            tomorrow.  If the choice is not to respond, please disregard the draft. Attachments to
            the letter would be the RCA letter orders and the May 25 Juneau Empire article.



            I tend to write in legalese so feel free to edit. Perhaps Rosanne could work with me on
            the draft tomorrow.



           Thanks,



           Randy
