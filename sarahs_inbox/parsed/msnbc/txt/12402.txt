                  Subject: NBC
                 NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams is interested in a one-on-one interview with you about Exxon
                 Valdez.
                 I suggested right after tomorrow's Exxon Valdez news conference.

                 It would be 10- 15 minutes.

                 If you would like to do this, Sharon can give the producer a call and make the arrangements.
