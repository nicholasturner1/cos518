            Halcro and Fagan are ticked about my letter to Wesley Loy re : Halcro not being a gasline
            expert . My aunt said they tore me apart on Fagan earlier this week . I love itt If Halcro
            is going to be your biggest critic, I'll happily be his . Kari Sleight is letting me write
            a compass on the whole issue - i'll show you guys the draft before I submit incase there are
            any key pts I'm missing - this will be a good platform to reitterate your msg re : bringing
            ak it ' s fair share and also to emphasize halcro's lack of expertise.

              Good idea, to me. But I'll run that by gasline team. Bruce Anders, Kurt Gibson and others
             are working on AGIA messaging - let me run by them your request for what tone to take in
             fairbanks. Thanks

               Also, I'm speaking to Fairbanks Chamber on Tuesday. What tone do you want me to take
             with respect to Conoco issues and Port Authority?
