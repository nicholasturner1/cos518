           Thanks, Ivy. However, neither my secretary nor I have seen the resumes or the draft press release, at this point.
           Can you tell me where they were delivered so we can track them down?

           Jacob from my office delivered a complete list of resumes and the draft press release to your office on Friday
           afternoon. Please let me know if it didn't arrive. Also, I don't believe Todd will be serving as an honorary chair,
           but perhaps Governor Palin or Mike can shed more insight on that decision.

           I still need the following to get the Council going: contact info for Todd so we can discuss scheduling of meeting
           times/places; a list of the people who have been asked to serve on the Council (along with their contact info); and
           an updated list of all those who applied for the Council so they can be contacted to provide input and/or serve on
           sub-committees . I'm hearing rumors about who was appointed and that a press release is imminent, but I don't
           have the final list of members with contact info - and have nothing other than names for a couple of the Fairbanks
           and Wasilla members.

          All -

           FYI, the department will be launching a Health Council website to provide internet access to info on meetings of
           the Council, opportunities for public input, and ongoing work by the Council. Our plan is to have links on both the
           Governor's website and the department website to ensure stakeholders can find it easily.

           Thanks for all your work on this Council. I look forward to receiving the information needed to get the Council up
           and working - and to delivering a report to the Governor and Legislature by January 1, 2008.
