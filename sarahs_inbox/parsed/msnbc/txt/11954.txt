              Anchorage Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc., a member of the national NeighborWorks®
              network, is receiving $200,000 in flexible first round grant funds from NeighborWorks®
              America - providing a much-needed boost in support of their affordable housing and community
              development activities. Overall, NeighborWorks® organizations in Alaska will receive $445,000
              in NeighborWorks® America grants this year. Working together, NeighborWorks® America and
              NeighborWorks® organizations throughout Alaska will be responsible for leveraging $16.4
              million reinvested in the community to create more economic development and affordable
              housing opportunities for Alaska citizens.

              In FY 2008, NeighborWorks® America (also known as the Neighborhood Reinvestment
              Corporation) will provide more than $76 million in grants to its national network of more than
              230 community-based nonprofit organizations to create homeownership for lower-income
              families, produce and manage affordable, high-quality rental properties, stem the tide of
              foreclosures that threaten neighborhoods and local economies, and revitalize and strengthen
              communities. Additionally, NeighborWorks® America will provide more than $167 million in
              National. Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program grants to HUD-approved housing
              counseling intermediaries and state housing finance agencies through a special appropriation of
              funds provided through the FY 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act.

             "For every one dollar of NeighborWorks® grants, we help leverage $37 in investment for
             America's communities, resulting in a direct investment of nearly $4 billion in distressed
             communities in fiscal year 2007, primarily from the private sector. As stewards of taxpayer
             dollars, NeighborWorks® ensures our investments are working in ways that truly make a
             difference," said NeighborWorks® America CEO Ken Wade. "We thank Congress and our other
             private, philanthropic and public fenders who make our work to expand affordable housing
             opportunities,. strengthen communities and stem foreclosures possible. Although no one
             organization or sector can resolve the foreclosure problem alone, NeighborWorks® America is
             making a significant contribution to this effort."

             Established by Congress in 1978 as the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation,
             NeighborWorks® America is the original community/public/private partnership model, with
             locally-driven, efficient community development and leverage of the public investment as its
             hallmarks. Over the past 30 years, NeighborWorks® America and the NeighborWorks® System
             have consistently replicated this successful model in over 4,450 communities in all 50 states, the
             District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; in America's urban, suburban and rural communities.
