          Hello,



          Makes perfect sense to have a TV, in the kitchen; I'm surprised we

          didn't have one sooner!

          I checked and there's not a cable, but am told that it's pretty easy to

          drop one down into the kitchen. I'll proceed with GCI and getting a TV.

          Hi E! Forgot to ask if there's a tv cable in the kitchen - if so can we

          get a small kitchen tv in there? We do seem to spend a lot of time in

          that room!



          Thanks much
