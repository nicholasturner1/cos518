              Governor - the back up was due today but they have had to extend . Latest we heard is
            that we will not get the back up until the bill is transmitted . I do not know when that
            will happen but expect it within the next week to ten days . I believe the legislature will
            want you to have to act while they are in special session.

               I thought back up info was due today ? Also- when can I expect to be handed the budget,
            thus giving me the ticking 20 day clock for vetoes?
