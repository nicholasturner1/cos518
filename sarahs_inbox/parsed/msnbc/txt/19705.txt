               From my understanding Randy has incorporated her comments/tone and prepared another draft
               since then. The deadline was missed, but Sharon said she thought this was taken care of before
               she left Anchorage so I've asked her to clear up the cluster w/Rosanne (and Meg Holland). We
               will get the polished statement to Meg tomorrow. Again, sorry as I was just venting about how
               all this went down and no matter how much I tried to resolve and help - it was still a cluster.

              Rosanne- I understand adn contacted you re : the number of meetings rve had w Walt , and his claim that it was only four.
               I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception, every trip, phone call and face-to-face that I had with
              Walt. There will be many, many instances to cite.
                Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.
                Also notable is all the mtgs/conversations he had with COS, Dep COS, Special Assistants, etc. And the fact he was NEVER
              refused any request to meet with any of us . He met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG , also, in
              "communications" with me.
               Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.
              And pls pass on the Bill McA. What's his email addy?
                Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points. Thanks
