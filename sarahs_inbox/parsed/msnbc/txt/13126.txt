                   There is an attorney named Ralph Cashen who is trying to contact various people
           about his client former Nome Police officer Owen who was convicted of murder. He is
           appealing the conviction and is trying to re - open the investigation .   He called me and
           wants to get me to have the troopers reopen the case because he has a " firm belief" of his
           client's innocence and believes the Governor would agree with him. He asked for my
           support to p ush for a new investigation and absent that my "permission" to talk to the
           Governor .  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted   He is being told by my staff that I
           will not attempt to intervene in th e case and that I cannot prevent him from talking to
           anyone including the Governor . So, he may call the Governor .  He mi ht imply he has my
           p ermission to do so because I have not attempted to stop him . Privileged or Personal Material Reda
