          I didn't see your names on the distribution list for Sam Bishop's summary of Secretary
          Kempthorne's press conference, which Sam attended. Hence, the summary is attached. It
          will give you a good sense of the ebb and flow.

              Dear Sarah! Thank you so much for the card for Evangelos. We most definitely will enjoy it. I wish you wouldn't
              have spent any money on me (us) or gone through the trouble!!!
              Also, thank you for your loyal support of Joe. I think truth will prevail and he will have a chance to put the facts on
              the table for all to see his good direction.
              You are truly a great leader, I'm so proud that Joe is serving under you!
              Love and thanks again to you and your family.
