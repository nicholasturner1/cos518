               Governor:

              We have made progress getting details on costs, federal tax issues, coverage issues, impacts on Alaskans
              through deductions or setoffs that our energy program benefits would have on existing federal assistance
              programs like foodstamps, etc. (hold harmless issues) and several other misc. issues. The federal tax issue is
              one of the most important issues because if we can avoid federal taxes , we avoid losing 20-30% of every dollar
              we put into the program to taxes.

               There are a lot of rumors in the halls about these issues. Our goal is to get the facts to Steve so he can put
              to ether the best possible proposals for payments to utilities and debit cards. Privileged or Personal Materia
