               Subject: State Highway Safety Plan - Deadline for submission to FHWA

             Dear Governor:

             Sorry to bother you in the midst of a very hectic day, but I needed to ask you about this because the deadline for
             DOT to submit the State's proposed Highway Safety Plan is coming up next week. The Plan has to be signed
             (which to me means approved) by the Governor or her designee (Leo Von Scheben).

             Based on your earlier concerns, DOT amended the part of the plan saying the state will seek to pass legislation
             making wearing motorcycle helmets mandatory to encourage motorcycle riders to wear helmets.

            The only 2 other items I see that could cause major controversy:
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            I have asked DOT to hold off submitting the plan until close of business next Tuesday, so you would have time to
            consider whether to ask them to delete or amend these.

            Thanks

            Randy-
