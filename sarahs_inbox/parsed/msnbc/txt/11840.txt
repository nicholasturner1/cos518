               I just spoke with Senator Green and she wanted to pass on her apologies for not being able to attend.
               She will be in Senate Resources until 5:30pm , then a quick stop at the Republican headquarters , then a dinner
               engagement at 5:45pm.
               Thanks for the invitation,
               Ginger
