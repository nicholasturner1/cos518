             UPDATE:  HB326/SB232 concerning National Guard fire fighter pay passed out of Senate
             Finance this morning and will go to the Senate for final vote. It has already passed the
             House.  This is a Governor sponsored bill.




             I think yesterday's closure on the supplemental, combined with the ongoing internal
             pressures (from us and legislators from both sides who are invested in these bills) will
             loosen up gov's bills in S FIN. We will stay on it, of course.
