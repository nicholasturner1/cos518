MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the arrival of your son!



I so appreciate your carefully chosen words in your released statement:



"Trig is beautiful and already adored by us. We knew through early testing he would face special
challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable
joy as he entered our lives. We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has
potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed."



Of course, I do not know what special challenges your new son will face, but it is obvious that God is
a big part of your lives and with Him, you will face these challenges together with grace, dignity, and
love.


                                                    1                                 ROSTON 02190

I am so happy for your family, and for your awesome outlook on life, our Savior, and the new life He
has blessed your family with. Trig is fearfully and wonderfully made! :)




Praising God with you,



Leah Jackson and the entire Jackson family

(6 of us, and 1 more on the way)
