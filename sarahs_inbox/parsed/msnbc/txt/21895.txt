               It is almost amazing to see the big and long-term achievements that are being accomplished
               under your leadership.  You have a way of treating folks that makes them want to do
               everything they can to help accomplish your goals. I think this is it: trust. Trust
               that you have the State's best interests in mind, and aren't afraid to push forward to
               accomplish that.



               You are writing history.
