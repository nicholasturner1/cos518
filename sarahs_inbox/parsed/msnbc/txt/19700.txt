            My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is
            going to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai
            woman? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are any details I need to
            hear them- like when this will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.

               He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've
            had very good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.

            Most of the statement is in the there toward the bottom - I had switched the order of
            paragraphs to emphasize what was most important and that is the number of times that
            you've met with Walt . The main thing missing is a summary of your four trips seated
            together to rural Alaska and your days together in Bethel , New Stu ( twice), and
            Dillingham . Also , we reworked the last statement re: AGIA.



            Below is what you approved Governor - for use tomorrow by anyone who needs to reiterate
            your points.

          First, regarding the number of meetings I've had with Walt over the last year and a half,
          in addition to several face-to-face meetings, Walt and I spent

          much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety, and my
          desire for immediate action.   Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of
          discussions at events throughout the state, including four trips to rural Alaska seated
          together on the plane. During those trips to Bethel, New Stu (twice), and Dillingham, we
          also spent our days together. That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every
          reception, other trips, and phone calls that I've personally had with Walt. To suggest
          that he had four face-to-face meetings with me in 17 months to discuss public safety is
          untruthful.   Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with Walt,
          on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow Commissioners, the Chief-
          of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants, etc. There is not
          one instance where Walt was turned down for a meeting, a phone call, or any type of
          conversation.




          Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware that he had several various plans in the works
          related to staffing and recruitment and retention. I would assume those plans are the
          same ones we discussed in those events and meetings, during Cabinet meetings, and on the
          plane, among other places. Those plans mirrored my thoughts and ideas to get more
          troopers and tackle the alcohol problem. That's why the ideas remain behind Kopp - only I
          expect immediate action in this new direction, not just another reminder of our plans.
          Regarding the draft 2007 annual report.  My staff has advised that a copy of a lengthy
          draft report was provided by him for review by the special assistant and Chief-of-Staff.
          Again, though, I'm ready for results. And so are the people of this state.




          AGIA has been appropriately time consuming.  AGIA is our future; the gasline is the
          financial security for the future of our state. The revenue from the gasline will pay for
          our essentials, including public safety. However, the time spent on AGIA over the last
          year and a half has not been to the detriment of ANY department or its missions... and all
          the more reason to have high expectations that I have self-starters and results-oriented
          cabinet members.

            Per Rosanne and Sharon ,     this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland at the ADN.




            Former Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan
            Holland.  My response to those questions follows:



            Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to
            staffing and recruitment and retention . Like the legislature , I was focused and aware of
            a lack of results in recruiting and retention . Action and results , not words are the
            bottom line.  For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the
            troopers with nearly 1 in 7 positions being unfilled . There were 56 vacancies as of June
            30, 2008. I was also aware that regardless of any plans of Mr. Monegan's, no new
                                                              4




                                                                                                          PRA_GSPO1_0021418

           positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were filled, which made it
           even more important to get the job done.



          Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual report. I was aware of the
          draft and in fact, had several questions about it that Mr. Monegan never answered. My
          special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft. The fact that Mr.
          Monegan prepared a detailed draft written report of the troopers' activities in 2007 does
          not change the bottom line or lack of results under Mr. Monegan.



          Mr. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him.   This is wrong . In addition to
          several face-to-face meetings , Walt and I spent much more time together discussing the
          future and direction of public safety, and my desire for immediate action. Remember that
          Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at events throughout the state,
          including one-on-one time together on the state's plane traveling to the bush. That's in
          addition to every cabinet meeting, every reception, other trips, and phone calls that I
          personally had with Walt.   To suggest that he had four opportunities with me in 17 months
          to discuss public safety is untruthful. Also notable, are the meetings and conversations
          that my staff had with Walt on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow
          Commissioners, the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-Staff, Attorney General, Special
          Assistants, etc.  There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a

            meeting, a phone call, or any type of conversation.



          While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state's business on
          all other fronts as well, and will continue to do so.
