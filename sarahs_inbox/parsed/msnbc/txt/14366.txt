                RE: Kevin Fitzgerald - Judicial Council

                Dear Members of the ABA,

                I would like to comment on Kevin Fitzgerald's run for a seat on the Alaska Judicial Council.

                I am involved in proceedings against attorney Brent Cole & during these proceedings Mr.
                Cole called Mr. Fitzgerald as a collaborating witness. Mr. Fitzgerald committed irrefutable
                perjury to collaborate Mr. Cole's irrefutable perjury - resulting in felony conspiracy.

                I am seeking justice in this mater and I think it would reflect poorly on the Alaska Bar
                Association to elect such a person to sit on the Alaska. Judicial Council - which selects the
                judges for this great state.

                Respectfully,

                David S. Haeg
