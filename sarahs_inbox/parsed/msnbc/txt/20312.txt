          Erika,



          1. "I apologize once again that you were disappointed for not being

          recognized at the Former First Ladies' Tea."



          This doesn't even make sense. How can someone apologize for your

          disappointment? A person can only apologize for their own actions.



          2. "It was never mine or anyone else's intentions to have you feel

          slighted." Then why were all other house managers recognized and not me?



          3. "As I mentioned in the previous email this was an event to honor the

          First Ladies' and their contributions . " Same as above - Then why were all

          other house managers recognized and not me?



          Please tell me who wrote the program for Mr. Palin. Perhaps my question

         might best be answered by that person.



          Thanks.



         Sharon

          > Please clarify what the main focus was and how recognizing ALL other past House Managers
          in attendance, and not just a select few, might have derailed that focus. I seriously
          doubt that Governor Palin's Administration would tell you not to recognize me.

            Thank you for taking the time to bring this to my attention. I sincerely apologize
         that you were disappointed at the Former First Ladies Tea, no disrespect was ever
         intended.  The event's purpose was to honor the First Ladies' and their contributions to
         the House and State of Alaska. The original intent to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of
         Alaska's Statehood was first and foremost the significant contributions that the First
         Ladies have made.



         >> It would have been wonderful to have included everyone, but I'm confident that having
         had this role, you will understand that in our positions our purpose is to serve the
         administrations that we work for and ensure that the main focus of the event remains
         intact.  I do appreciate that you took the time to address this and give me the
         opportunity to respond.



         >> Thank you so much for sharing your photos from the Cowper administration!
