              Mat Maid board to Palin: No
              By S.J. KOMARNITSKY

              The Matanuska Maid dairy is still on track to shut down early next month despite pleas and
              $600,000 in already-promised state money from Gov. Sarah Palin.

              A creamery board, which oversees the state-owned dairy, met Wednesday in Anchorage
              and rejected the governor's public request that it keep the dairy open, saying it stands by
              an earlier decision to close the plant July 7.

              In doing so, board members rejected a request from Palin to use a pending $600,000
              appropriation to keep it open.

              Board members cited rising expenses, competition from Lower 48 brands and an
              economic model that simply didn't support staying in business.

              "We are being fiduciarily responsible to the state of Alaska and the people of Alaska by
              doing what we are doing... Nobody wants to be here and make this decision, least of all
              me," chairman Mac Carter said in an emotional speech after the decision.

             Staying in business longer could leave the company more than $2 million in the red by
             the end of the year, he said. Closing now means the company will be able to pay its
             debts, he said.

             The board did agree, however, to send cost estimates to the governor of how much it
             would cost to keep the dairy open and a list of factors that could affect those estimates.

             Alaska farmers said the closure will leave them with no place to sell most of their milk
             and may force them to kill their herds. Matanuska Maid is the largest buyer of milk in the
             state.

             "What am I going to do? said a clearly distraught Craig Trytten, who with his wife,

              Vicki, and children run a dairy farm at Point MacKenzie . "Am I going to quit milking cows?
              Just shut the switch off and hear them scream and scream? Where's the electricity going to come
              from to milk them?"

              Gov. Palin could not immediately be reached for comment. But in a letter to the board Tuesday,
              she criticized its short notice to farmers about the closure and asked that they use a $600,000
              state grant to keep the dairy open by running a scaled-down operation that would use only local
              milk.

              Board members, however, said Palin's plan was not feasible. Mat Maid currently imports most
              of its milk, and local farmers do not produce enough to make it worth operating the plant, Carter
              said.

              Matanuska Maid was started as a farmer' s cooperative in the 1930s . It was taken over by the
              state after going bankrupt in 1986 and operated profitably for most of the ensuing years until
              2005.

              Matanuska Maid CEO Joe Van Treeck said after the meeting the dairy has set July 3 as its last
              day to pick up milk from farmers.
