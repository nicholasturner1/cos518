               JUNEAU - Gov. Sarah Palin's budget vetoes appear safe from a legislative override.
               Several high-ranking lawmakers say the chances to get 45 out of 60 lawmakers to support an
               override are just about gone.
               Lawmakers still have until 11:59 p.m. Saturday to override some or all of Palin 's $268 million
               capital budget cuts.
               This morning, a special session hearing on a gas line proposal was delayed an hour while
               members of the House and Senate discussed their options, but they could not agree on what
               projects should be put back on the books.
               By the time hearings resumed , members of the finance committees said their best effort had
               come up short.
