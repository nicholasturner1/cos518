          MESSAGE:

           Gov, Your honest words were challenged, and ridiculed, but you speak anyway. Thank-you
          for fighting for us.I know you truly care about the terrible poverty in this state. Thank-
          you and the legislature for opening up this energy industry for all the people of Alaska.
          And not just a token few. Thank-you for your purity of intention, I think those of us, who
          intimately pray everyday for peace and food hear this in your voice. I hope your little
          one is healthy and He and your family are in our prayers, everyday. God Bless You and keep
          You safe is our prayer, Michelle Plantier
