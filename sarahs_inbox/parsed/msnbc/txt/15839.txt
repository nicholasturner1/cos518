           MESSAGE:

           Gov. Palin,




           I am writing to commend your tenure as governor of the great state of Alaska and urge you
           to unite, as the Republican Party's Vice Presidential candidate with Senator John McCain.




           There is no doubt you would be the best choice he could make in terms of a running mate.




           Thank you.




                                                                1
