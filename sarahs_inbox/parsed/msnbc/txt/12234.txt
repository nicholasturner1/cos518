           Here's the   quote from Hollis French's press release: "Testimony was provided by the
           Department   of Health and Social Services, which reported that the department has recently
           formulated   a position on the legislation. "I am here on behalf of the department in
           support of   this bill in the attempt to make health care a reality for all Alaska
           citizens,"   said Deputy Commissioner William Streur." Glad Karleen says it was taken out
           of context   and that they're working to fix.
