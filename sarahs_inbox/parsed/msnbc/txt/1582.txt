  Your mom wanted to know if she should change her flight to Monday (originally Saturday) in order to
  watch the kids?

  Hello,



  Sally paid the $3.and signed the form. I emailed Todd about sending the
  skates & helmet, and it's on the House calendar. We should be set!




  Kari is scheduling Piper's Kindergarten conference for you to attend, either
  on March 7th or 8th. It sounds like your mom is staying until Monday to
  watch Piper and Willow.



  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything!



  Take care,

  Erika
