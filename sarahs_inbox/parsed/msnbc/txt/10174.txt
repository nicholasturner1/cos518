              He's good at throwing venomous labels but were you able to identify the issue? Is it the
              underlying purpose behind RTL? Was it WAR standing up and talking about his conversation
              with you and Dan (after you were gone) about getting the two of you together at the
              speech; or was it about something you said that he identified???

              I turned it on to listen to the news on my drive to Wasilla- too bad I caught his two
              minutes before the news . He slammed RTL, the dinner, and especially my "horrible" speech.
              Yuck.

               So what was all the negative he said about my "horrible" speech at RTL? (His quote.).
