            Governor-



            For a change of pace, how about a radio interview on your fishing experiences?

            Hello,


                                                                  1

            My name is Jon Schoepke, and I am the producer of the Big Wild Radio Show



            www.thebigwild.com. We are an outdoors show based out of Madison, Wisconsin



            that is syndicated on 19 stations throughout 56different states (MN, WI, IL, NE, MI, and
            IA).




            I would like to make an interview request for Sarah Palin.




            The phone interview lasts for 13 minutes and it happens on Fridays from 10 AM



            to 1 PM Central Time.




            We would like to interview Sarah in regards to her fishing experiences! If she would like
            to talk about anything else outdoor related as well that would be perfect.




            The Big Wild has been in syndication for five years and we pride ourselves



            in being total screw ups! Unlike most outdoors shows we are NOT experts, we



            laugh at our short comings. We've had on such guests as Jeff Foxworthy, Ted Nugent, Joe
            Boucher, Charlie Daniels, Marty Stouffer, and Jim Fowler.

            Please call or email if you happen to be available and if those times don't



            work out , we can always reschedule to fit your needs.




            Thank you for your time and consideration.
