        Dear Ms. Musgrave:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        I am woefully slow in writing to thank you most sincerely for using your veto pen on that
        Loussac Library funding request. I had written you (more than once) to state my
        opposition to that particular line item, and I was overjoyed to see that you did indeed
        veto it.  From a Loussac Library employee, a great big heartfelt THANK YOU!!!




        Sincerely,

        Jackie Musgrave
