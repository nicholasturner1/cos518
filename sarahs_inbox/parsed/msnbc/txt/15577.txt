            dear governor and others. I just finished a telephone interview with Newsweek. I had
           received the referal from my staff from Sharon leighow. I tried to stayclose to talking
           points from Steve Daugherty and said we we like polar bears and favor reasonable
           development. We acted to avoid having a bad decision become worse. Talis.

              All,




              Governor Palin has been invited to be on Fox News and CNN's Glenn Beck show tomorrow to
            talk about the polar bear listing. The Governor wanted me to check with all of you to get
            your feedback on whether she should do the interviews. Also, the Anchorage Daily News
            editorial board is inquiring about the state's analysis of the science behind the listing
            - see below.




              Any feedback you can provide would be appreciated.




              Thanks

               Sharon,



                 Apropos of the story about Rick Steiner and his request for info about the state's
            analysis of the federal science behind the polar bear listing - I would like to see what
            the state's scientists said about it. If the governor is choosing not to release what the
            scientists said, I'd like to know why. Science is best done out in the open, where the
            work can be critiqued, no? This seems like a case where any "deliberative process"
            exemption should be waived in the public interest, so the public can see the science
            provided by the state's scientists, before the science arrived in the hands of
            politicians.



                  An open and transparent administration would release the scientists' analysis
            unfiltered, wouldn't it? (yes, that was an editorial statement - in case you're wondering
            where this is likely headed....)
