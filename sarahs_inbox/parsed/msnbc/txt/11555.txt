             Hi Janice- my sister is requesting a signed pic for a friend... Can we get some Vogue
             copies? And AK Mag?

            Jon wants you to sign a copy of your picture in Vogue

            and write on it, " Dear Dr . Jon-        Still working on

            Wheelerville.      Governor ......"       Sign an Alaska

            Magazine the same way.
