 Hi Todd,

 Your welcome. Just let me know when you decide what your travel plans are. I will not be at the House on Monday
 (State Holiday), but call me on my cell or my home phone if something comes up. No shoes & phone yet, so
 probably later today.

 Enjoy your weekend!

           I Goldstreaked a pair of Bristol's shoes and a cell

           phone yesterday, they should be there today, if not

           last night.

           Thank you so much for helping my family.If you need to

           get in touch with me please call my cell.

                  Hello Todd,




                  Just a quick update!




                  We ordered Bristol's shoes yesterday from the

                  Footlocker and they were

           only $79.99, they didn't charge for shipping &

           handling or tax, so that

           was a good deal! She said that she had a pair she

           could get by with

           until the new ones arrived. I tried to find that

           piece that the news

           channel did when the family arrived to the House,

           but couldn't find it.

           I found a list of different stories that involved

           the Governor and some

           of them had video clips... If you have a minute,

           would you mind

           emailing me the on-line information on how to find

           it?   I know you're

           busy, so no problem if you don't get to it.




           Just as an FYI- in your office there   is a safe in

           the closet and the

           combination is in the top drawer of your desk. You

           can put that comb.

           anywhere you want to, I have a copy taped to the

           side of my desk in my

           office just in case you misplace yours.




           Please feel free to contact me if there's anything

           you need me to take

           care of.   I can't stress enough that I /really do

           enjoy/ helping out

           with the kids when you and the Governor need me to.

           For someone who had

           4 kids herself (and really wanted 6!) and taught

           junior high (and loved

           it!) and knows what it's like to work full-time I

           really don't mind,

           *especially *while you're transitioning your family

           to Juneau and

           figuring out the logistics of everyday life. I

           sound like a broken record!




           Let me know when you figure out your travel plans

           and if you have any

           traveling preferences (window, aisle seats...) and

           I'll take care of

           getting your tickets.   I have a TA for you from this

           last trip that I'll

           put on your desk for you to sign. I have the

           Governor's mileage number,

           but if you could send me yours and the kid's then we

           can make sure that

           your accounts are credited with the travel mileage.

           I took Bristol to

           get her physical yesterday, and I was thinking it

           might be a good idea

           for you to give me information for your family so

           that if you and the

           Governor are busy and don't have access to it, I'd

           have back-up copies

           of their SSN, Insurance Group numbers, etc.... Just

           a thought, but it

           might be helpful to have a /family information/ file

           just in case it's

           needed over the next four years (or eight).




           Have a good day, and have fun training!




           Thanks,

           Erika
