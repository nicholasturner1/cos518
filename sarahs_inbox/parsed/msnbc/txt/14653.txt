           We have a couple ideas about what the announcement might be. We are drafting responses so
           we can be ahead of the curve. As soon as we hear for certain we will get with Rosanne and
           help where we can. Tom

             If press needs to grab me for statement on whatever Bowles is announcing today they can
            catch me at Sheraton - noon - Nurses Appreciation function. Or after that at Click's DOL
            graduation thing in Palmer. Or spring concert tonight in the Valley.




             And pls let me know what they announced.
