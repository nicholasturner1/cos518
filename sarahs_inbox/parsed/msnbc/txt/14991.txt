            No, I did not know it ended up in Elton's hands. Which email was it? How in the world did
            it get leaked?

            Governor as you already know the e mail you sent me on juneau access which I forwarded to
            mal menzies has ended up with sen elton and printed in his newsletter.
                                        We are trying to find out what happened but somebody has
            really jumped off the deep end here and I am going to do my best to find out what happen.
            It goes without saying I feel terrible about the situation. Leo
