News was good tonight. They talked about the new direction of the dept, annette having no idead
what monegan was talking about, frank's disappointment in waft and that he was aware of the threats
of wooten, and molly's statement that she had to call 911 last wk and wooten's threat the family was
going down. By the way, the press release was great. It infers everything that wasn't being done
under the previous commissioner.
