             Thanks. Is he saying there's new developments on pipeline that we're not yet aware of? And
             is.he requesting a meeting with me? If so, i haven't received the invite.

             Chuck, per your request, I will distribute your letter to Congressman Dingell to the
             appropriate State people.  Thanks for letting us know.

             Dear Governor:

             I missed meeting with you during your visit last November.

             Hope you may squeeze me into your schedule this week.

             I regret the embarrassment that may emanate for your

             Administration by Commissioner Irwin's improperly

             researched letter to Chairmen Dingell and Rahall.



             Another Congressional release on BP gross negligence in Prudhoe

             operations soon will identify gross, 'inept', oversight by regulators

             ADNR, PSIO, AKOSH, and the Fire Marshall.

             If you don't halt Reconfiguration of Pump Station #3 promptly
I
             90 % of Alaska's annual revenue may be in peril. You publicly

             stated that NO PUMP #3 CONSTRUCTION WOULD PROCEED

             ON YOUR STATE LAND until Pump #9 is operating properly and

             safely.     Pump #9 has serious 'identified' problems which ould cause

             disruption of the oil flow through the TAPS this winter.



             As.I told you on the phone last year ,    I have a plan for your

             oversight (along with the BP shareholders )     to protect your

             interests    (beyond your regulators ) without any expense for

             the State.
