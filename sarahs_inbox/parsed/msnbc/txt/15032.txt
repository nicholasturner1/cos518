                 Subject: E-mail

               The e-mail that has been leaked is the one that I believe you sent to Leo on Sunday after the ADN ran the article
               about Juneau Access. I believe the e-mail mentions that Juneau Access is not a priority , that the project is tied up
               in litigation and that we need more accurate cost estimates . All of which is consistent with our letter to Sen.
               Kookesh from a few weeks earlier.

               Other than the statement that the project is not a priority , I do not see any statements that are inconsistent with
               the position we took in the Kookesh letter or that Sharon provided today to Pat Forgey . It's true, the project is tied
               up in litigation and we need accurate cost estimates . Given these facts , the project should not be and cannot be
               a priority of the administration because its tied up in court by environmental lawsuits . In other words, how could a
               project that is tied up in federal court with a pending permanent injunction request and no corps permit be a
               current priority . We don 't even know if the project can be built legally.
