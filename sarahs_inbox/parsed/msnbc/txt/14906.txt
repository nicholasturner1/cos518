           Dear Governor,

           An article about you and your new baby was in our local paper today. First,
           congratulations to you and your family. Second, I wanted to share this article with you.
           In Pennsylvania, it is NOT illegal to ask a woman if she is married or if she has children
           during a job interview. Most employers won't hire mothers. Glad you got to keep your
           job!!

           I thought you might find these stories interesting:
