             Just a reminder that our DV Task Force meeting will be meeting next Wednesday. July 16% at 8:00 a.m.
             The meeting lasts about one hour. Please come prepared to share ideas about working with other
             professionals and community members to assist and provide services to victims of domestic violence and
             sexual assault, as well ideas & thoughts about holding perpetrators more accountable. Feel free to invite
             others to participate in this group.
             I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday, so please call Judy Gette @ 746-6249 if you have any
             questions.
