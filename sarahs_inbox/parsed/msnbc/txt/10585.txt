             MESSAGE:

             Dear Smart Beringian Governor,




             Thank you for your suggestions, ideas, comments and amazingly insightful contributions
             offered with generosity, in the development of the Beringia Museum!



             The Strategic mapping meeting was, as Matt Ganley stated, another important & dynamic step
             in the successful planning process of making our museum a reality. We couldn't do it
             without your partnership and support!  Thank you!




             I will be taking some time off for the Holiday Season , and will return to work on January
             14,2008.  If an urgent issue arises which needs my immediate attention, please contact me
             on my cell phone, listed below.  We are entering a critical stage of planning and
             fundraising, and I don't want to miss any opportunities, if I can help it.



             As you attend holiday gatherings, and are visiting with those who may have connections to
                                                                   1

              Beringia Museum initiative !  Your help is so appreciated by the Elders of the Bering
              Strait!



              Finally , I hope this Holiday season finds you in the company of good friends , faithful
              family members , and delicious food & drink . May your evenings be warmed by the heat of a
              well stoked wood fire, the laughter of children and the contentment that comes from
              knowing you are appreciated and respected.



              Merry Christmas , Sarah!
