                  Subject: Bill Signing Dillingham

                We're working on a bill signing for late next week in Dillingham for the family . Representative Edgemon would
                like to sign his Head Start bill in Dillingham and he 'll be there Thursday, July 31d.

                We could fly you and the girls out mid afternoon on Weds . Janice pulled flight options and I'll bring those with me
                so we can review tomorrow and discuss return if this is of interest.
