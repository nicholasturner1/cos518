             Lt. Governor: if at all possible, if we're missing any appts that are being requested by
             local officials, can we tap into your office for assistance? There are only so many his in
             the day, we're not refusing anyone an opportunity to meet with me and/or third floor
             officials, but evidently some AML members don't think we're trying hard enough. I am
             canceling more internal mtgs with staff to meet with others, but still... there are only
             so many slots in one day. Thanks

             Janice- has mayor Williams (ketchikan) even asked for a mtg during this week's visit? Has
             Tim Beck?



             Sharon/Beth- if u get the sense this gripe is growing legs (as my gut is telling me), pls
             respond with a stronger, proactive statement re: we DO rearrange scheds to make sure every
             mayor requesting does get a mtg. Thanks

            It's a scorcher . Mayor Williams' complaint (and Tim Beck's) that I won't/didn't spend time
            w/ the Mayors ... sheeeesh...



            Sharon ' s comment was great that those who ask will get time with me/our office. That's our
            committment.



            I don't want this issue to grow legs, so whatever we have to do to make sure we're not
            double-booking or ignoring Mayors who will scream that they're being ignored - we'll do
            it.



            Mayor Williams says I condemned former Govs for ignoring them - I know I have not done
            that and it'd be refreshing if reporters asked for facts to back up complaints like
            that... but anyway we'll keep trying to plug local officials into the schedule as best we
            can - even if that means cancelling other internal mtgs or outside speeches. Thanks
