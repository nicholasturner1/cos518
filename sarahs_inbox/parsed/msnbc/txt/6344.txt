         MESSAGE:

         Hi Governor,



         I saw you on the news tonight & it reminded me of a recent visit to the Anchorage
         International Airport in regards to "Welcoming our soldiers home".



         When coming down the escalator from the North Terminal at AIP, there is a completely tiny
         sign saying, "Welcome home soldiers" or similar.

         As I saw the sign I said to my wife, "Boy, if I was a soldier I wouldn't feel very welcome
         looking at that pathetic sign!"

         She agreed completely with me.

         So...my request is that you completely change the welcome sign to our Armed Forces by
         having something outstanding.

         My wife thought of something like a flat-screen TV w/a video of you welcoming home our
         troops (or something artistic, personal & unique). Attention catching is the key - sorry I
         don't have a better idea, but hopefully this email will generate some ideas to really help
         our troops feel better.

         I invite you to go to the AIP (or send an aide with a video cam) and check out what I mean
         - I think you'll agree.
                                                                1
