           I apologize as I did receive the email yesterday on adding Ben Stein to your calendar. It
           is done. I have sent out email letting staff and COS know that you will be available for
           short stop-by only on the Mayor meetings scheduled.



           I am adding the commercial flights that we have booked for you for the JNU/ANC/FBKS
           flights this weekend. I have asked that you have the King Air for the weekend if it's
           available (they have informed me I will have an answer tomorrow afternoon). We were able
           to book the Aspen Hotel in Fairbanks. Janice
