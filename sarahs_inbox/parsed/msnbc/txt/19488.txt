             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              No. 08-118

                                   Governor Lauds Oil Industry Development

             July 14, 2008, Anchorage,Alaska - BP announced today that it had sanctioned the
             development of its Liberty prospect in the federal waters in the Beaufort Sea Outer
             Continental Shelf. BP will push the envelope of technology by drilling ultra extended reach
             wells, with the largest land rig in the world. This technology will minimize the impact of the
             Liberty development on the environment.

             "I want to congratulate Alaska's oil industry and our Department of Natural Resources for
             these pro-development achievements," Governor Palin said. "Our state has the resources
             and the people to address the nation's energy needs. Alaska remains an attractive and
             inviting place for oil and gas industry investment. I look forward to more good news in the
             future."

             When production begins in 2011, the state will share In the royalties paid by BP to the
             federal government. Under existing law, the state will receive 27 percent of the royalties or
             almost 5 million barrels over the life of the project. The state and other producers on the
             North Slope will also benefit from potentially lower tariffs on the TAPS pipeline. At its peak
             in 2014, Liberty will produce 40,000 barrels per day and contribute to an increase of 6
             percent of total TAPS throughput.

             BP's Liberty announcement comes along after a string of good news in Alaska's oil patch.

              Unit. Qannik production will peak in 2009 at 4 , 000 barrels per day . With potential expansion the
              prospect may yield over 25 million barrels. On June 13, 2008, Pioneer began production from its
              Oooguruk field. Oooguruk is a 90 million barrel oil field that will reach peak production of 20,000
              barrels per day in 2010 . Pioneer is one of the new independents now working in Alaska and is the
              only independent operator on the North Slope . Soon to follow Pioneer as operator of a new
              producing oil field is the major Italian oil company ENI which sanctioned the neighboring Nikiatchuq
              oil field in January 2008. Development of this oil field is now underway.

             He's not at this conference and he's already been there (is my understanding... don't quote me on
             that I'll have Joe or Tom or someone confirm), but yes we've sent out the word that we want him,
             obama, everyone else to get up here and see the swath of land for themselves. I've spoken w him
             about ANWR but don't remember if in that conversation 5 months ago I repeated our open
             invitation for him and other elected officials to come up. Maybe I should put the invite in written
             form too?
