              Governor,

              I just spoke with one of our attorneys again. The parties reached agreement on many points but not all. I
              understand APOC is meeting to decide whether the objections the plaintiff is still raising over the website are
              valid. If APOC rejects plaintiffs remaining objections, we expect the website can go back up. If APOC finds the
              plaintiffs remaining concerns are valid, they will issue a final decision prohibiting the state from posting the
              website. Our attorneys anticipate a ruling by APOC tonight.

              Larry

              Thank you folks ...I assume they didn't rule in time for today's appeal. Thank you for your work on this.
