                Governor,

                Tom, Marty, Joe and I would like to talk to you as soon as possible this morning
                about Conoco's announcement today, and our response. We're contemplating a 3
                p.m. press conference to get our message out immediately. We'd like to talk before
                we decide on a course of action.

                Janice, please let us know if there is a time slot we can slip in. Thank you.

                -Pat
