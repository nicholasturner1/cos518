              Governor Palin,




              AK Workforce Investment Board is a 23-26 member board that currently has 20

              members.




               Cynthia Erickson has been placed on the AK Workforce Investment Board and

               Chris Hayes was removed; however, Cynthia does not replace Chris Hayes

               because Chris Hayes' seat is restricted to a person that has earned a GED or

               works in adult basic education (ABE). ABE is a federal requirement.
