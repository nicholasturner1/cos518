           A perplexing thing about all this is that (and I'm not laying blame,

           just noting the irony here) it was not my idea, I did not compile

           addresses , nor compose ( or even see the email until yesterday), yet I've

           had to answer to it repeatedly over the past couple of days without

           anyone noting that someone had to have orchestated, initiated and

           accomplished the email send .       I know the buck stops with me, but that's a
                                                                     1

           significant " miss " in all this, that no one stood up and offered to set

           Wesley straight by letting him know it was their idea and their doing

           and we're unapologetic because whomever did this (Mike?) didn't do

           anything wrong. I sure would have felt more confident about the coverage

           of this if someone had merely stood up and claimed ownership.

            He did write a story on how our political enemies thought we had done

            something wrong, but all 15 comments were on our side, I'm pretty sure.

           Will re-read them, but don't remember seeing even one against us.
