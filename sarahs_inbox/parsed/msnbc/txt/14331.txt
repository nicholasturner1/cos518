              Subject: Coeur's new proposal

             Dear Mr. Griffin:

             I am writing in support of the new SIR prepared for the paste tailings change at Kensington
             which meets all NEPA requirements. No new SEIS or EA should be necessary, given the
             analysis provided in the SIR and three previous EIS's, supported by over 1000 studies and $35
             million in environmental baseline engineering and design studies.

             The PTF will use the existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) outfall
             previously permitted after a NEPA analysis. The PTF will also use the existing water treatment
             facility which has been shown to be effective in meeting state and federal water quality
             standards.

             The Sierra Club, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council and Lynn Canal Conservation
             supported taking the paste option forward as a better environmental alternative than the DTF.
             Paste tailings require less space and allow for enhanced water recovery, reducing water
             consumption. In addition, all contact water will be recycled or treated and will meet EPA's zero
             discharge requirement. The PTF berm will only be 85 ft. high, as compared to the dry stack at
             220 ft. high. The closure/reclamation strategy is simple and straight-forward, and there are no
             long-term water treatment requirements for the encapsulated tailings.

             I support the proposed move to Yankee Cove for transportation of workers, a fully permitted
             privately-owned facility, which eliminates the opposition of the Conservation Groups (SEACC,
             Sierra Club and Lynn Canal Conservation) to the Cascade Point facility. The move does not
             otherwise substantially change the transportation effects studied in the 2004 SEIS.

             The Kensington project is very important to the economy and future of Southeast Alaska and I
             am confident that the SIR process provides the environmental analysis to allow Coeur to
             proceed with this plan and the opportunity for open comment on this SIR enables involvement
             by public as required by the Conservation Groups
             Thank you and way to go COEUR.
