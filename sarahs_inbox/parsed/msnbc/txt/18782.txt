           This is the first I've seen of the presser , but Larry's edits are excellent - is there a need to
           tweak anything else in this?

           Governor,
           I have attached DOT's draft press release that has now been edited by Larry Persily. It appears to me to be for
           Alaska media . Randy just returned from DOT and I told him I want to finalize the plan for Gravina today including
           press advisory , confirmed date and message for national audience , communication to local legislators and press
           release.

            Russ and Randy,

           Yes, DOT sent us the draft to look over . My rewritten version is attached . And here are the
           accompanying comments I sent DOT at the same time:

          John & Larry,
          Attached is draft that DOT is kicking around . I'm suspecting /hoping that it has been run through your office by
          now.
          I've CC' d Randy so he can run point for the gov's office on this issue . I know he planned to call you and
          MacKinnon regarding this issue soon.
          A quick background would best be saved for a phone conversation . Suffice to say, I'm not comfortable with DOT
          generating drafts and I never asked for them to provide one. They are being "helpful."

                Sheeeesh - I went on AK GOP website last night. Ben is STILL the GOP National Committeeman! So he
                and Ruedrich are still the faces of the party in the state and they represent the party nationally.

                It is time to call for Ben's outster from that position . A short comment on this is long overdue, and now
                that Ben's been named as one who was bribed (duh...), it's irresponsible of me NOT to call for him to step
                down.

                There's no "separation of powers" issue to respect here as there is with calling for the unindicted Cowdery
                to step down. I'm free to call for this with Ben.

                Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to do so today, in passing I will let ktuu or ap know my opinion on this.
