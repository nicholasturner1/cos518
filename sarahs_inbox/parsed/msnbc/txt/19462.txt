          FYI. Also doesn't sound like the BB111 ad ran. Heyworth' s name is still listed in the
          revision and I'll ck on what he's doing.

          I talked to Rhonda this morning. She had only gotten Walt's perspective on things. I
          talked to her about being positive and that we were disappointed that he did not want to
          consider the other position that he could have really excelled in. Anyway she seems ok
          with the conversation and was appreciative that I called her.




          The papers this morning and last night just indicated that Walt thought it was wrong he
          was let go and that the voice of support came from the union........ The article I don't think
          was damaging at all and at least the reporter did his homework and found out there was a
          similar situation that happened at the Muni. So I think after a couple of days worth it
          will be over. Time to move on.




          Hope you guys got some sleep last night.




          Mike
