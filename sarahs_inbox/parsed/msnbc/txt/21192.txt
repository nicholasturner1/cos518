            This guy is a trip.



            Good job Sharon. And I'm sure no one excluded anyone from listening in or participating in
            the teleconf with Elton. Pls make sure I'm correct on that- i would never instruct anyone
            to exclude.



            "Celebrity watching?". What a doof. Beth can detail for your our many hours of mtgs and
            interviews, and newsweek's announcement that Gov Napolitano and I will be the speakers at
            their inaugural West Coast conf in februrary. We didn't even stop to catch our breath on
            this trip- as Beth can attest to.

           Bob-



           Senator Elton was scheduled to attend the briefing in person but was

           unable to get to Anchorage because of the weather. The teleconference

           for the Senator was arranged at the last minute. The Governor was aware

           that a teleconference was not going to be part of the House and Senate

           briefings.     I am not sure she was made aware of the arrangement we made

           for Senator Elton.



           As to your claim that the administration did everything it could to

           limit the public's chance hear what the administration wanted to say to
                                                                    1




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01_0006479

            the Senators - not true .          I have repeatedly told you that the meetings

            were open to the public.



            Just as an FYI - no media attended the Senate briefings either day in

            Anchorage.     Furthermore, the only person who has complained about the

            open briefings has been you.

            Sharon,



               Thanks for the Newsweek schedule. I noticed that the governor was not

            on it as a participant ,      so is it correct that she was just part of

            whatever audience was allowed in?



               On your ACES briefings for the Senate majority yesterday:

              According to Sen . Elton's staff he had to agree to no one else could

           be present in order for him to be teleconferenced in to the session

           after his flight to Juneau had problems .           If this is correct it seems to

            indicate did everything it could to limit the public's chance to hear

           what the administration wanted to say to the senators.

               Since she's off celebrity watching, I would like to confirm that she

           was aware of and approved the refusal to teleconference this week's

           briefings anywhere.

                                                                   2

                  Finally, you still haven't given a reason for those decisions. Both

            you and Russ have only said the decision was made. I just left a reqest

            with Mike Tibbles' secretary for an interview to get an answer to that

            question.



                  I'm doing another special edition of Laws for the SEA tomorrow and

            would like any administration comments by the end of today, please.




            Thanks,
