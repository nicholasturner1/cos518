              I turned it on to listen to the news on my drive to Wasilla- too bad I caught his two
              minutes before the news. He slammed RTL, the dinner, and especially my "horrible" speech.
              Yuck.

              I don't listen? Do you?? Why?



               You did great and you were clear in your position!



               Why do you think people stood and applauded multiple          times? :)
