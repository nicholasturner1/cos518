  Hi Erika,

  Sharon and I just worked it out and we'll send out a media advisory about the event and include the CCC
  info. Please let me know if you have any other concerns, and I'll make sure we run the media advisory
  past you before we send it out. Thanks!

  Kate

  Kate,
  Capital City Celebrations wasn't included ... My fault, I should've caught that when you sent me the
  proof!! Is there anything we can do to make sure they're mentioned in the future? They requested the
  event and have invested financially to bring the First Ladies up (travel, transportation & lodging ) plus they
  funded the KTOO filming etc... The group set this in motion when they requested to have the tea; so
  they're the co-host. I sent the invitation that mentions that they're co -hosting the event with Mr . Palin, so
  that verbiage would work if anything else goes out.
  Thank you!
  Erika
