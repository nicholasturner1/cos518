           Dear Governor Palin,  I will be visiting my Sitka office to meet my staff there for the
           first time today. So I am not sure if I will remain in blackberry range. I will be back
           in Juneau tomorrow evening.  Talis

           Subject : 2nd amendment




           Dear Ms . Leighow,



                 The State of Texas has indicated it is fine we issue a limited press release
           regarding the 2nd Amendment Amicus . In light of that we suggest the following based on
           your earlier proposed statement:




                  STATE OF ALASKA SIGNS TEXAS AMICUS BRIEF




                Governor Sarah Palin announced the State of Alaska will be joining the multi-state
          amicus brief authored by the State of Texas in support of the Second Amendment right of
          individual Americans to bear arms .   On Tuesday , February 5, 2008 Alaska Attorney General
          Talis Colberg notified the Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott that Alaska would be joining
          the Texas multi - state brief . The Texas amicus brief in Washington DC v. Heller will be
          filed by February 11, 2008.



                Governor Palin , a lifelong NRA member , has long been a champion of the
          constitutional right to bear arms as well as a proponent of gun safety programs for
          Alaska's youth.



                 "I am proud to join the State of Texas in support of the Second Amendment," said
          Governor Palin .  " We need to send a strong message that law-abiding citizens have a right
          to own firearms , for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful
          purpose".




                That should be fine. Talis




                                                        2




                                                                                                    PRA GSP01 _0011743
