           The Attorney General will get back to me as soon as he can regarding our statutory limitations to participate and
           influence a ballot initiative . I will pass along the information when I hear back.

            hmmmmm - I'm torn on this one b/c i purposefully asked that I not be a focus here - my belief is
            administration should NOT attempt to sway the outcome of ballot props - that as a candidate and in a
            personal arena anyone is free to use anything I've publically said on the record about the issue, but the
            way this is portrayed officially as the Governor??? this really surprised me.

            remember we did NOT participate in writing the language of the voting pamphlet for the
            aforementioned reason - my belief that we weren't supposed to try to sway the vote once it's in the hands
            of the people.

              Hey Folks,

              Just a reminder, we told the Alaska Family Coalition that the Governor would not be making a statement
              on this issue. However, we did say that anything that was said on the campaign trail is okay to use.
              Looks like they did their research!
