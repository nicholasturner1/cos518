              I believe this day could work for her stopping in.

              Hi Governor:

              I am coming to Anchorage next Thursday, May 8, to attend the Anchorage Republican Women's
              luncheon from 11:30 - 1:00 at the Petroleum Club. I arrive at the airport at 9:30 am and
              fly out again at 3:10 pm. I was wondering if there is some time that I could meet with you
              for a few minutes within those parameters? I know you have a busy schedule and this is
              short notice but if you could fit me in somewhere for a few minutes to discuss parental
              consent, PBA ban and any other leg issues you would care to discuss, I would appreciate
              it. I am also sending a note to Lt. Gov. Parnell to see if it is possible to meet with him
              also but about his congressional race.
