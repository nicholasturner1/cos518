              Are we still looking for help in the media relations /communications area?

              Alyse came across a woman (who interviewed for a management Job where Al se is
              working) with an outstanding pedigree in that field. Her name is Privileged or Personal Ma,
            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              I've attached her resume. Let me know if you want Alyse to have Privileged or P ubmit
              something more formal.

              Hope this helps.
