            open public seat on the Minerals Commission.



            The function of the Commission is to make recommendations to the Governor and to the
            Legislature on ways to mitigate the constraints, including governmental constraints, on
            development of minerals, including coal, in the state.



            Speaking with Rich Hughes, the Development Specialist who oversees the Commission, they
            are specifically in need of experience with a Large Mine. privileged or Personal Material Red

            Of course Tom Irwin strongly recommends him as a top choice for this seat.
