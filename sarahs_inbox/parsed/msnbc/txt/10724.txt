               I haven't heard anything different or new since our Dec 6 mtg... I'm still of the belief
               we're going to find an "energy czar" to help coordinate all this.



               Unless I'm missing something, I haven't heard of any changes.

               Governor and Mike,   since we last visited on December 6 about the Administration's energy
               policy including potential comments for the state of the state, we have been spending
               time evaluating ideas to move an energy plan forward based on what we felt were decisions
               in that meeting.   We haven't heard anything directly but we are hearing rumors about
               changes in direction.   If there are changes I think we should have been involved in the
               discussions. What is expected from DNR at this time?    As always we are more than willing
               to help and I continue to feel this is a crisis. We have lots of Alaskans really hurting
               from high energy costs. Thanks. Tom
