            I spoke with Karen Olson of the Alaska Farmers & Stockgrowers, Inc. this morning. She
            informed me that the mining contributors requested that no media/press releases be
            executed at this time. She explained that the money received was allocated as follows:




                                                                  1




                                                                                                             P RA_GS P01 _0011922

            72% ( $54 , 000) of the money received was equally distributed between the 4 dairy farmers
            ($13,500 each ) located in southcentral;



            22% ($16 , 500) would be paid to SDJV to make cheese; and



            6% ($4,500 ) would be used by the Alaska Farmers & Stockgrowers ,      Inc. for advertising,
            distribution and other administrative costs.




            Please let me know if you need anything else.




            thanks
