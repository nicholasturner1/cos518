             Hi Sarah!




             Well I guess I will get strait to the point considering you are a busy women! I want to
             come to Juneau next summer and work. I have already researched several job oppertunities
             and then I got to thinking.. .1 think you need a nany for Trig :) In fact how about this
             summer because I really dislike my summer job ;) I hope all is well and although Im
             serious about being a nany I will still keep in contact with my Aunt Janice about other
             oppertunities in Juneau!
                                                                                                                            i

              Always,

              Elle
