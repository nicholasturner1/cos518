           Good ANSCA meeting - dynamic women running those corps !  (And some men ...). The group
          asked to wk w/Kris on statehood celebration - I said yes - Kris will call Sherri Buretta
          on it.



          Concern about HR216 that I hadn't heard about - they requested John Katz provide Orrie
         Williams with more info on the federal legislation dealing with AK lands. If you've got
         info, could you pass on to Orrie, Mr. Katz? They say the issue may be slipping by our
         delegation.



          I committed to attempt to " resolving to resolve" the subsistance issue - bless his heart
         Matthew Nicoli takes me at my word when I repeat that of course I want it resolved, but I
         don't have the silver bullet and won't pretend I have the answers today - but "I'll seek
         divine wisdom 'cuz that's what it will take" to deal with subsistance. I do want to work
         on it with him and the other native corp CEOs and look forward to serious discussion that
         should lead to some unity on the issue. We had great dialogue on our transition team re:
         pro and con preference be we engaged Dick Bishop and Kenny Johns as our team leaders - we
         need that continued until we find solutions.



          Kroloff loves our committment to workforce development - we need to work closer with
         native corps on training programs. They like Click. Thank God. ;)

          Always concerned about 8 ( a), thank you Mr Katz for the update on status that I could
         share w/ them re : our committment to keeping elements of program . They were thankful for at
         least that acknowledgement that it's on our radar screen.



          They want say in new Educ Commish - I said I ' d love their input, so make sure Bd of Educ
         hears it , as the board forwards candidates ' names to me for selection.



           And they promised not to ask me about cows today .         So I loved them.




           On another note,

           Kohring resigned today and I was all giddy with the prospect of selecting a wise and
          independent Valley character to replace him - got the giddiness knocked right out of me
         when I heard the state GOP leaders have their search for replacement                " underway". I'm
         asking Talis for advice on this - PrivilanPd or P _rsnnal Material Redacted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



          Also today in whitehorse Premier Fentie and.I presented feasibilty study on that $10
         billion railroad plan - felt I could take him up on his repeated offer to help present the
         findings be Alaska paid half the $5 million study that was commissioned under Murkowski.
         It was a big deal in Whitehorse , we need now to get the study in front of Alaskans for
         vetting.



           Think I covered today ' s ANSCA agenda and am seeking info from appropriate personnel to
          follow up on their issues . So, now go drink some MatMaid milk and have a good evening.

            What is the mtg this afternoon? Who

            invited me ? What's the agenda?

            I have the address and time ,      but that's it.




            I will not be speaking - I have not been told anything about speaking

            there so sure don't want to be caught off guard - they' ll be just

            presenting some info to me on what's going on with their Native Corps?

            I'm guessing.



            In fact ,   is there any way the two ladies        ( Buretta and who else?) Can

            meet me in my Anchorage office instead of me driving over there after

            Karl Clausen's event? I don ' t know what time his gig is over with.
