MESSAGE:

My deepest congratulations on the birth of your baby Trig. We have an 8 year old girl , Tuisku, with
Down syndrome . She has a 11 yo brother and 5 yo sister. She is wonderfull and just this morning
played with her cello Lightly Row with a classmate playing it on the piano . She is a great sister and
we are extremely proud of her. She loves to read and write and do her homework . She sings in a
choir and takes cello lessons and loves to swim and have playdates with friends . You will have fun
with your new baby and your lives will be fine . I am so glad that a high profile mom like yourself,
would welcome a baby with Down syndrome into your family.

Sincerely,

Anu Arsalo
