         That's my preference, if it's a possibility.



         It will certainly help a lot of people sleep at night .                    We are asked about MTAB on a
         regular basis.

         Do you guys want to try and get MTAB out the door before session ends ?            I think there are
         only a couple of things that need to be ironed out.
