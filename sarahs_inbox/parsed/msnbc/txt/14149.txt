                 Aaron- I heard about this Friday night. I. will look in to this issue Monday morning and probably call for an
                 emergency BOG meeting to deal with the issue. I want to talk to the staff first to get there reasoning. I
                 was taken completely by surprise as the BOG had no such intent. Cliff J.

                   Ted,

                   This needs to be addressed NOW! There are possibly hundreds of families that participate in this
                   hunt.

                   I am sure the normal bear baiting regulations are still on the books. They can be re-instated.
                   This may take some time and money from ADF&G to remedy the situation, but that is the price of
                   making a mistake.

                   If the state decides to have a predator program, and only a predator program for baiting in unit 16, we
                   all look like hypocrites.

                  The board and department has continuously said "predator management and sport hunting need to be kept
                  seperate" .
                  This makes the predator control the only option for people wishing to sport hunt over bait.

                  This will be a news story if we cannot fix it very soon.

                   It is not an option to wait until July.

                  Thanks,

                   Aaron

                   Aaron thanks for the attached note.

                   Actually I heard about this unanticipated ( at least to me) consequence to the Unit 16 bear control effort. I am
                   certain the board did not discus or knowingly endorse a provision to eliminate youth hunters in Unit 16. This
                   board has a clear record of supporting youth hunting not reducing it.

                   If there is any need to assign blame for this oversight it should fall squarely on the shoulders of the BOG as the
                   rulemaking body.

                   I support an effort to address this situation at our earliest convenience . Our next scheduled meeting is July 2,
                   2008.

                   Subject: No bear hunting for kids in unit 16

                   Hunters,

                   It has come to my attention that ADF&G or the Board of Game have efectively eliminated Residents under 16
                   years old from hunting over bait stations in Unit 16.
                  I have a feeling this was done by ADF&G, not the board.
                  I am confident that the board did not intend to eliminate residents under 16 from hunting over bait.
                  The traditional 'sport hunting' bait station permit has been eliminated for resident hunters.
                  The only option a resident hunter has is to get a Predator control permit.
                  ADF&G should maintain the normal bear bait registration for residents , as well as have a predator permit.
                  This is 100% contrary to ADF&G's policy to 'keep predator management and hunting seperate'.
                  Children under 16 years old are not allowed to participate in the Unit 16 bear predator control program.
                  The wolf control programs have no age limit, so it makes no sense to have one for bears.
                  This area has been hunted extensively by families with the use of bait stations for decades.

                  I have been told it is too late to change this for this year , I don't buy it!
                  Please take the time to voice your oppinions to ADF&G, your Legislators, and The Governor.
                  You can find many of their e-mails in the CC line above.

                  Thank you,

                  Aaron Bloomquist
