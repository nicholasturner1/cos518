           Thanks John . Appreciate the info - amazing that some still want to claim we ' d essentially
           turn down federal dollars if they came via earmarked projects . We're on the right path
           with our true message though . Thank you.

           Alex Kaplun , E&E Daily reporter



           For decades , Alaska's two senior Republican lawmakers built their = political careers and
           repeated electoral successes in large part on their = ability to bring federal dollars
           back to America' s largest state.

           But with a changing political climate across the country -- and perhaps = more importantly
           -- the state itself, Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young   -- may find that what has long
           been considered one of their biggest = political advantages may not be much help in
           perhaps their fiercest = electoral challenges in decades.

           Indeed , Democrats hope that the two GOP lawmakers ' once-perceived = strength of padding
           federal legislation with millions of dollars for their = home state will help lead to
           their downfall . The races are especially = attractive because Stevens and Young were seen
           as virtually untouchable = just a couple of years ago.

           Stevens has been revered as the most popular politician in Alaska = history, praised by
           local officials as being a one-man economic engine for = the state and repeatedly fighting
           for Alaska ' s. interests in the four = decades that he has held that post . Young, likewise,
           has had only a couple = of tough electoral fights since capturing Alaska's lone House seat
           more = than three decades ago.

           During their long tenures on Capitol Hill, the two lawmakers have = secured powerful posts
           that assured their home state was consistently = among the biggest, if not the very
           biggest, per capita recipient of = federal dollars -- an achievement that traditionally
           garnered them praise = in Alaska.

           But more recently , Stevens and Young have become the poster children = for anti-earmarking
           crusaders and fiscal conservatives , who have criticized = the two as being among Congress'
           biggest "porkers" in part for their = much-publicized efforts to secure hundreds of
           millions of dollars for two = controversial bridges in their home states.

           Normally, such attacks may not have mattered a great deal and political = observers say
           that no matter how much the two are criticized by interest = groups in the lower 48
           states, their political undoing will not be the - earmarks themselves. But they add that
           the state ' s somewhat changing = attitude -- led in part by the popular Gov. Sarah Palin
           (R) -- toward = federal spending may not provide the buffer that it once did for the two
           incumbents.

           "I think Alaskans in general appreciate being able to tap into the = federal largess and
           all the benefits for it," said Jerry McBeath, a = University of Alaska-Fairbanks political
           science professor and an expert = on Alaska politics . " But it was highly embarrassing for
           Alaskans to be = perceived nationally of milking the federal cow excessively."

          Democrats have recruited their preferred candidates to challenge both = incumbents, with
          former state house Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz ( D) = running against Young and
          Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich ( D) poised to = challenge Stevens . Begich, son of former Rep.
          Nick Begich ( D-Alaska ), has = thus far only formed an exploratory committee and has not
          fully committed = to the campaign , but Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman =
          Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y.) told reporters last week that he expects Begich to = run.

          A Rasmussen Reports poll released last week showed Stevens in a virtual = dead heat with
          Begich , capturing 46 percent of the vote to 45 percent for = the potential challenger. A
          separate poll conducted by Hays Research in = Alaska showed Young trailing an unnamed
          Democratic challenger, 41 percent = to 34 percent.

          Both Young and Stevens also face primary challenges , though Young's is = viewed as being
          somewhat more serious since Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell ( R) = unexpectedly entered the race last
          month.

          Corruption, earmark investigations



                                                         2




                                                                                                    P RAGS P01 _0015203
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com     Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




           The single biggest problem heading into the election for Young and = Stevens is the
           specter of corruption issues hanging above the incumbents' = heads -- in some cases ones
           related to earmarks.

           The FBI and IRS raided Stevens' Alaska home last July to investigate = remodeling work
           there as a possible link to a bribery case involving oil = services company VECO, and
           Stevens said the FBI asked him to preserve = records as investigators continue their
           examination . Stevens' son , former = state Senate President Ben Stevens ( R), is also under
           investigation.

           Young has also been embroiled in the VECO scandal as the firm contribute= d heavily to his
           campaign.

           Additionally, Young has faced questions about an earmark that he = secured for a Florida
           road construction project after accusations surfaced = that he received $41,000 in
           campaign contributions from a developer who = stood to benefit from the earmark. The
           Florida lawmaker who represents the = district did not ask for the earmark and Sen. Tom
           Coburn (R-Okla.) intends = to offer an amendment this week on the Senate floor that would
           setup a = bipartisan commission to investigate the earmark.

           Primarily because of those scandals, polls show that the approval = ratings for Stevens
           falling to about 50 percent and in some cases below 40 = percent for Young.

           Already, Young's challengers are taking aim at the long-term incumbent = over his earmark
           positions.

           In a debate last month, candidates from both parties jumped on Young = for both the
           Florida and the "Bridge to Nowhere" earmarks, accusing the = incumbent of harming the
           state's reputation. Young, however, said that he = would continue to ask for earmarks and
           that he is proud of every earmark = he has brought to the state.

           Democrats in Washington have also made clear that they intend to attack = Young on the
           earmark issue, using it to portray the lawmaker as someone = who is an embarrassment to
           Alaska voters. "People of Alaska have to be = wondering what their congressman is doing
           getting favors for an intersectio= n in Florida," Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the
           Democratic Congressional = Campaign Committee chairman , said last week . " You don't want
           someone who = is going to embarrass you in Washington , and he ' s been an embarrassment to =
           the people of Alaska."

           The Alaska Democratic Party has also launched a Web site -- RetireTed.com
           <http://retireted.com/> -- that highlights = the Bridge to Nowhere and other earmarks as
           one of the reasons why = Alaskans should vote to remove Stevens, arguing that the earmarks
           have = been used by Stevens to reward his associates and have shined a negative = light on
           the state.

          Already, it is apparent that lawmakers are responding somewhat to the = changing political
          climate regarding earmarks. Both Stevens and Sen. Lisa = Murkowski (R-Alaska) earlier this
          year announced that they would make = public all earmark requests received by their
          offices.

          Stevens ; however , has also repeatedly defended Congress ' power to - earmark , arguing that
          it represented an effective way to meet the needs of = the state and that federal agencies
          would not necessarily do any better = job of spending those dollars . " Those of us that get
          elected by Alaskans = go and listen to people in boroughs, listen to the state
          Legislature , = listen to people in the city governments ," he said earlier this year. "We =
          try to get Congress to approve what they ask for and the.only way we can = do that is
          through the earmark process."

          And though Stevens and Young supporters acknowledge that the incumbents = could have
          tougher election cycle this year than in the past, they = maintain that voters will still
          place substantial value in having = representatives in Washington who know how to secure
          money for the = state.

          "It is still important to Alaskans," said Dave Dittman, an Anchorage-bas= ed pollster who
          works for Stevens. "They don't like waste in general, but = they don't view the projects
          for Alaskans to be wasteful."

           Beyond the earmarks , Dittman argued that Stevens in particular has = built up goodwill
           among the electorate through his constituent work on = behalf of individual residents --
           something that is particularly important = for a population that feels far removed from
           the federal government in = Washington.

           "A lot of their strength and support has been not so much what they = could bring to
           Alaska but they could for Alaskans when they had problems = with the federal government,"
           he said . " When everything went wrong and you = had nowhere else to go and you had to solve
           a problem , you would go to = Senator Stevens."

           Popular Palin



           One potential problem in the arguments made by Stevens and Young on the = value of
           seniority and ability to tap into federal dollars is Palin, who = is enjoying high
           approval ratings and has called on the state to move away = from heavy reliance on
           earmarks.

           "We can and must continue to develop our economy , because we cannot and = must not rely so
           heavily on federal government earmarks ," Palin said in = her State of the State address
           earlier this year . " Let us power up and = produce for Alaska and America. We can do this
           -- we're 50 years old now , = and it's time."

           Indeed, Stevens has also said that with Alaska being a state now for = more than 50 years,
           it may have less need for earmarks . " Stevens several = years ago started telling state
           officials that it was a harder and harder = sell to bring money to Alaska because the
           state ' s development was no = longer young," McBeath said.

           At the same time , Stevens has publicly criticized state officials for = seemingly not
           supporting federal earmarks while not providing alternatives = on how to fund the state's
           needs.

           Political observers say that clash on earmarks represents only part of = the schism that
           exists between Palin and her allies -- including the = lieutenant governor that is
           challenging Young -- and the old guard that = has controlled state politics for decades.

           It is unclear at this point , just how much that division will hurt = Young and Stevens.
           Still , observers say that if nothing else the governor ' s= anti - earmark rhetoric could
           undermine at least some of their campaign - message.

           "There's a huge schism in Alaska Republican politics and that sort of = defines it right
           there," said Anchorage pollster Anne Hays , whose polls = show Palin ' s approval ratings at
           more than 80 percent . " The governor ' s = numbers have just continued to be off the chart
           and her position has been = transparency and no earmarks."
