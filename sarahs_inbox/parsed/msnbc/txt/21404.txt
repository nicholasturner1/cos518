             Governor:




             Here is a copy of your AFN speech.




             I've copied the commissioners whose programs are highlighted.



             if they have any comments or changes , I'll ask that they send them to me no later than
             noon tomorrow (Tuesday, Oct. 23) and I'll consolidate all of the edits for you.
