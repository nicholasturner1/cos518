           Dear Governor .Palin,




                 My daughter and son-in-law live in Soldotna and she told

           me of your new baby. If someone has not sent you the booklet

           entitled "A Gift called Michelle", An inspirational story of

           hope, I will send it to you. I am an ND for over 30 years and

           I do believe this story will be very uplifting to you and your husband. It will be my gift
           to you from my family in Alaska!



                                           Sincerely,



                                         Ralph Edwards
