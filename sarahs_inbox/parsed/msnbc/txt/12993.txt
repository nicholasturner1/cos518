            Todd and Willow will be visiting classroom(s) on Wednesday , maybe one day before that too.
            We'll look for bookmarks for them to hand out in the Anchorage office, and we'll need a
            load of those kid books from the mansion to be transported here so we have them to
            distribute outside of Juneau (that can wait until we can load them in the king air). Pls
            note on sched what they'll be doing for First Family event( s) this week . Thanks
