                Hi Frank,

                I was just checking if I am still on the State Medical Board . Have I been reappointed , or has someone
                been appointed to take my place. The next meeting is coming up the first week of April, and I need to
                know if I am still chairing the meeting, and if I will need to make arrangements to my schedule to attend.

                Thanks
                David Head, M.D.
                Chair, Alaska State Medical Board
