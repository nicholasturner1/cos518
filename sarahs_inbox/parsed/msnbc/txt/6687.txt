         Excellent. Let Carl know I appreciate his out-of-the-box allowance of such actions. And
         pls let the Senators know of our appreciation too.

         It would be good for someone to give Gatto the word that this was appreciated. I was in
         his office immediately following and he was kind of sheepish, realizing that he may have
         breached some protcol, but not knowing what it may be. He and Cody seemed to expect some
         repercussions, but weren't sure.

         I had it going on in the background in my office .           It was a great committee

         hearing .   French and McGuire were the main testifiers . The questions were

         extremely thoughtful and showed an intense amount of research and genuinely

         fair and unbiased reporting of information from conversations with what

         sounded like Constitutional consultants and attorneys .            I absolutely agree

         with Bitney ' s assessment that the overall impression was one of cooperation

         and assurance that everyone ' s talking and working together to share

         information about AGIA.



         Thanks for sharing what was happening in the background , too, Bitney. Would

         have loved to have seen that on camera.

         In a somewhat unusual move , three Senators testified to the House Resources

         Committee about AGIA.



         Senators French, McGuire ,      and Wielechowski testified to House Resources

         regarding their efforts to make amendments to the bill in the Senate

        Judiciary Committee.



        Their appearance was covered live by Gavel to Gavel , and created quite a

         stir in the building.



        I sat down in the committee hearing to observe . . . and it became clear that

        the event was largely impromptu .       Nonetheless ... the point here is that it

        looked GREAT !!!      it gave the appearance that the House and Senate are

        working cooperatively to get AGIA passed within the           regular session.



        Also interesting...Lyda Green came into the Committee room looking baffled

        about the incident. It was clear that this was not a planned event. She

        was fine. . .but also wanting her fellow Senators to let her know "what is

        going on here".



        Bottom line:      The three Senators and Carl Gatto did a nice thing conducing

        the hearing in this matter. The buzz in the building is that legislators

        are uniting to get AGIA passed quickly.
