         At arrival, 7pm, go to the upper ramp (departures) to United. You'll be greeted there by
         airport personnel ( and me ) to take luggage.



         From there go back around to airport again to the bottom ramp/baggage claim area to
         United. Airport security will meet you there and escort you all thru security. They'll

             I'm still going to work on Faircount. They are not very responsive - which is not anything new.

             "Conspicuously absent" were fairbanks gas and GVEA, is another rumor. Also, that Enstar was
             never on board with the Richardson route and we sprang that on them that day. And that Harold
             and Enstar hate each other... I'm hearing other speculation also I'll pass on as people are dumping

             Set up the schedule and I will adjust in Juneau . I want to get the correct word out Just get me the time and phone

             Geologically, there are 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas available in Cook Inlet. That is a 9-10 year supply if the LNG
             export at Kenai continues (its current export license is set to expire in 2011 ). Without another extension of the LNG
             export license, those reserves would last an additional six years or so.

             Undiscovered resources in Cook Inlet have been estimated by the geologists at the USGS (feds) and DGGS (state).
             The USGS is very optimistic-in excess of 10 trillion cubic feet. The DGGS and Division of Oil and Gas are much
             more conservative-closer to 5 or 6 trillion cubic feet. If it's the lower figure, then 5 trillion cubic feet would be
             more than 50 years' supply.

                I hate to
                tell you but there are a few of us who are really confused.

               We really need someone to step up and help us
               understand what is really going on right now in our state.


               When we first heard Governor Sarah Palin
               announce that she wants and will heartily support a natural gas pipeline
               from the Kenai Peninsula to Fairbanks.... we thought she must have
               accidentally got the announcement backwards and that she really meant
               support for the bullet line to bring natural gas to the Kenai from the

            Re: FW: Emailing: Think About It Radio Kenai radiokenai .com KSRM, KWHQ, KKIS, ...                  Page 3 of 3


               North Slope.
               Then we
               realized that her announcement was not backwards and she really wants to
               bring natural gas from the Kenai to Fairbanks ...not only that, but the
               idea has been blessed by Borough Mayor John Williams and many other
               people who are supposed to have their heads screwed on straight.
               And that is the
               reason for our confusion.
               You mean to
               tell me that someone is hiding natural gas in a big underground pocket
               under Cook Inlet or somewhere in our
               Borough? I hope so.
               Didn't the
               State government and the Feds just approve a ten year contract with
               Conoco Phillips to send what little natural gas we have left in
             Cook Inlet to a foreign country?
               Didn't one of
                the biggest employers, Agrium, just shut down and send over three hundred
                people packing because there is not enough natural gas to operate their
                big fertilizer plant?
                Isn't one of
                the biggest worries of government officials the possibility of not having
                enough natural gas available in South Central Alaska to heat our homes
                and businesses during the cold winter months?
                Why then would
                anyone want to take the natural gas that we do not have on the Kenai
                Peninsula and ship it north through the rail belt to Fairbanks?
                Why wouldn't
                our state government organize and get behind an effort to bring natural
                gas south from the North Slope where we
                have virtually unlimited amounts ready to go to market?
                Why would we
                even be thinking about sending North Slope natural gas through a pipeline
                through Canada to the
                lower 48 markets without demanding that, first of all, it be shipped to
             Fairbanks , Anchorage
                and the Kenai?
                What is going
                on? I hope someone knows, but to us, that certainly does not appear to be
                the case. No wonder some of us are really confused.
