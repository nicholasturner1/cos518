            I have not seen this letter nor heard of its content (from Mayor Williams), but if it's
            mentioned in the press then obviously it's out there and I'll need to see it in order to
            respond.



            Who is responding to his request for this consideration?



            Janice or Joe- if our office has received this letter may I get a copy ? And I ' ll need info
            on who ' s responding . Thanks
