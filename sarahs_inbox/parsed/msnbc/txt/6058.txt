         We love you Kari!!!



         We want this to be an invigorating and exciting time for you - not too exciting so you can
         have peace and fun in the position - but new open doors bringing new, good things.



         We just unrolled our $237,000,000 in budget cuts. Ughhhhh! Brutal!!! Karen Rehfeld is a
         master, a brilliant mind, and wonderful person and I am amazed at what she and Joan
         accomplished with this budget. I had them so wrapped around the axle on line items and I
         know I drove them crazy with so many questions - they were amazing in putting this all
         together for our press conference today. I'm wiped out - the rest of administration
         probably is too.



         I told Meg we released the budget - now she can go have her baby. (They're inducing on
         Sunday!). She's worried about missing Monday's AGIA RFA roll-out.



         Anyway, crazy two weeks - I hope and pray you will love your position. From the bottom of
         my heart I thank you for your awesome attitude and the example you're setting through this
         chapter in our administration's life and through changes in your own life. Thank you Kari.

         Dear Governor and First Gentleman: Thank you so much for the opportunity to work with you
         in your new and bright administration. I am looking forward to the new challenges and
         learning ahead of me. I hope you and your family have a wonderful and restful summer and
         I wish you all the best for the next four years. I am only a phone call away if I can be
         of any assistance whatsoever to you. Kari
