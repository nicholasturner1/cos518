                    We're on our way to Squarebanks. Pray that Todd catches the young guys.

                   Kris,

                   I asked Sarah if she was interested in attending a Korean Community golf event per the request of James
                   Shin of Peters Creek Chevron . Sarah said she would like to attend if she was in town and to schedule
                   through you. I found out from James today that the golf tournament is June 28th at Eagle Glen golf course
                   on Elmendorf AFB. I let James know I would contact you to see if it fits Sarah 's schedule . Please let me
                   know if it is a go or no go. My cell is 227-5483 and James contact number is 727-5183.

                   Thank you, Kurt
