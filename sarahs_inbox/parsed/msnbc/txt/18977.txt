                  More to come on the press conference and the legislation.

                 Call of the Wild: No Food on the Terrace , Please, When an Unusual Guest Visits Capitol Hill
                 By Michael Sandler, CQ Staff
                 The House may, at times , feel like a den of wolves . But now Rep. George Miller, the chairman of
                 the House Education and Labor Committee , believes the chamber needs a visit from the real
                 thing.
                 The California Democrat has arranged to have a three -year-old Arctic grey wolf join him at a news
                 conference Tuesday on the Cannon Building terrace to promote legislation that would restrict the
                 aerial hunting of wolves in Alaska.
                 An estimated 671 wolves have been killed by aerial hunting since 2003, according to Miller's
                 office.
                 Supporters of aerial wolf hunting say it helps maintain populations of moose and other big game
                 for indigenous subsistence hunters. Opponents say its about tourism and protecting Alaska's
                 multimillion-dollar big-game hunting industry.
                 All would-be wolves from both parties are welcome to join Atka , the real - life predator, at the news
                 conference - under one condition.
                 "No food is allowed on the terrace when the wolf is present, " Miller' s office made clear in a news
                 release about the event.
