           Governor - This request has come in for you to attend on Sunday, August 26 in Sarasota, Florida. This is with
           the "deadliest catch" group. I did not know your availability as you were going to go from Anchorage to Sitka on
           Monday, August 27. Please let me know if you would like to do this. Thanks, Janice

           Good morning Janice,

           I wanted to let you know that Alaska Brewing company has now donated Alaska Beer for our Charity event, so it
           is truly going to be a full on Alaska dinner!! Its fantastic.

           Menu will be : Smoke Alaska Black Cod Croquette, Salad, Bristol Bay Red King Crab, and Baked Alaska for
           dessert.

          We will be donating everything to the childrens Charity including proceeds from t-shirts and pictures autographed
          by the skippers that afternoon. We are closing down Main Street in Sarasota for the autograph session, and will
          have music and beverages. At the dinner we will have a live auction with the premier item being a trip for 2 up to
          Dutch Harbor on our annual Crab Connoisseur Tour in October which will be October 27 - 29th. This will be
          bringing the lucky bidder along with 50+ Chefs and Retailers from all over the country up to Dutch fro the opener
          of the 2007 Red King Crab fishery.

          Everyone would really love to see Governor Pal!n in Sarasota . Phil, Johnathan, Andy, Keith and Larry would love
          to have her attend . Senator Bennett from Florida has also asked if the Governor will be able to attend.

          This would really put the bow on the package if it is possible. Please contact me if you have any questions.
           I look forward to hearing from you.



          All the best,
