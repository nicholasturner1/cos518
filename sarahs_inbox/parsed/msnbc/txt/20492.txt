                     Good Morning Governor Palin, I want to thank you for the great news on the Permanent Fund and
                    Energy Relief. You have made many people happy with your great work as Governor. I also read
                    about somebody in Anchorage who is unhappy with you. I did not read but the first sentence and
                    thought it was a lot of garbage. You are doing great Thank you again. Clifford Johnson.
