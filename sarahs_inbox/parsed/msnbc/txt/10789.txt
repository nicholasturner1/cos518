                  Dear Marty,

                  Please see attached for press release regarding important legislation, the Sudan Accountability and
                  Divestment Act, signed into law on Monday by President Bush. The bill would prohibit federal government
                  contracts with certain companies, including Sinopec, enabling genocide in Darfur. We ask that the
                  Governor immediately reject Sinopec's bid due to concerns about its Sudan operations.

                  Thank you for your consideration.

                  Regards,
                  Sam

                  Dear Marty,
                  Thank you for your correspondence last week . We will certainly provide feedback during the public
                  comment period . However, given the nature of the situation in Darfur , we would encourage the Governor
                  to consider immediate rejection of the Sinopec bid.

                  In a recent interview, Speaker Harris indicated that the Governor has the prerogative to eliminate a
                  proposal on any basis she sees fit. A recent Channel 2 (KTUU) poll found that 80% of Alaskans believe
                  that the state should reject a gas pipeline bid from a company with known ties to the Darfur genocide.

                  Finally , I wanted to let you know that last night the US Senate passed the Sudan Accountability and
                  Divestment Act, with the support of Senators Stevens and Murkowski . This legislation , which passed the
                  House of Representatives earlier this year, would prohibit certain companies operating in Sudan,
                  including Sinopec, from receiving federal contracts.

                  Again we are happy to provide further information regarding Sinopec , its operations in Sudan, or the
                  Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act.

                  Sincerely,

                  Sam

                  Thank you for your comments . Within the next few weeks the state will complete its review of the Alaska Gasline
                  Inducement Act (AGIA) applications to determine if they are responsive to the law and the associated Request for
                  Proposals (RFA.) Once that review is complete we will place all applications on the web and make them available
                  for public review. All applications that are deemed responsive to the law and RFA will also be available for public
                  comment. While we appreciate receiving your input today , I want to ensure that you know that the best time to
                  make comment will be once the applications are available for public comment , if they are complete.

                  In the meantime we appreciate your having taken the time to write.
                  Marty

                  Subject: Open Letter Regarding Sinopec Bid

                  Dear Mr. Rutherford,
                  My name is Sam Bell , advocacy director for the Genocide Intervention Network . Please find the attached open
                  letter sent today from our executive director , Mark Hanis , to Governor Palin.
                  We are concerned about the bid from Sinopec and the company's connection to the Darfur conflict in Sudan,
                  which has been labeled genocide by the President and Congress . Sinopec is the largest oil field services provider
                  in Sudan and the Sudanese government relies on foreign investment , particular in the oil sector , to fund its military
                  and the conflict in Darfur.
                  Our organization orchestrates the Sudan divestment campaign which now encompasses 22 states, 58
                  universities, and 10 cities (we are working with Alaskan legislators to introduce Sudan divestment legislation in the
                  state next year). Additionally, the US Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives have passed
                  the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act which would prohibit certain companies operating in Sudan,
                  including Sinopec, from receiving federal government contracts.

                  Sincerely,
                  Sam Bell
