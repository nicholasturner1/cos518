               FYI, We're going to ask Kate to spend about four weeks in Juneau-late January into late February-if she thinks
               she can do it from the personal perspective . [I'm giving her the option .] Will let you know.

            What next? What a way to kick things off...



            I really cannot believe this situation. I pray that what the enemy means for evil, will
            turn out for good.
