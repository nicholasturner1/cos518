           MESSAGE:

           I just want to congratulate you on the birth of your son. I am the mother of a 26-year-
           old son, Evan, who was born with Down Syndrome. I have learned more about unconditional
           love, acceptance and life from Evan that from any other person. I won't say there haven't
           been times of "AAHHGG!!" but let me tell you the joy he brings to your life will be beyond
           measure.
