           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor,



           I read news on the internet that you were expecting a child - congratulations.



           I did not know that Alaska had a female Governor, became curious and read your bio and
           your accomplishments (on your official website) - very impressive.



           I have traveled the entire world but have never visited Alaska and want to go someday and
           experience all its beauty and splendor.



           Sincerely,



           Ernesto Calzado

           Miami , Florida
