            Thanks. If that good news can go out sooner rather than later - it would be good

            We have a conf call Monday to review a long list of items, this one included because I
            think we're up to $75k now. But, I'll follow-up w/Tom & Kristan before that to determine
            some sort of acknowledgement of our efforts.

           Did it get publicized that miners gave $ to farmers ? Tom says theyt' re staying out of the
           publicity- but I' ve not seen it acknowledged publicly yet.
