          Governor I did receive this. The reduction in business license fees is still in play and
          we should be able to get it through this session! As far as the budget impact and
          replacing the loss of business license fees with GF that might get pushed out to FY 2010.
          We will need to update the fiscal note. I will work with Mike and Russ on that! Karen
