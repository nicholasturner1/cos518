            Dear Gov. Palin:



            I, too, have the privilege of caring for a special needs child. The State of Alaska is
            very fortunate to have a woman of such character and insight in the governors office. No
            doubt you have already done much research and found support groups and information of a
            positive nature that will help you in caring for your perfect child. We have a Web site
            that points to some resources, and I wanted to share it with you in case it would be of
            any use. If we can connect you with any online groups, we would be glad to do that as
            well.



            Web site : http:// trisomykidsarespecial.com/



            Our 5-year-old has an extremely rare condition: trisomy 14 mosaic partial--there are only
            15 to 20 like her known in the world at a given time. (As you know, Down syndrome is
            trisomy 21.) But the effects are all too common , and she shares many of those effects with
            other people with an extra chromosome.



            May you be blessed by your special child, as we have been by ours.
