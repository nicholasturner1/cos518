            Governor-



            Investor's Business Daily, an influential and widely read newspaper, would like 15 minutes
            with you for an oil and gas Q & A. They will provide the questions beforehand. The
            editors would like to tape your responses and post them verbatim on their op/ed page and
            pod cast site. May I pursue this?
