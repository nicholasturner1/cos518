            Dear Sarah I am a huge supporter of yours but am having trouble swalowing this budget. Its
            entirely to much. We need to can about 40 percent of our state employees. that would be a
            good start. Privatise everything we can. You need to study New zelands reform government.
            It worked.  If I can be of any assistance to you please call me sincerly Doug Glenn.
