  Subject: Scheduling Meeting - Wed., 09.05.07 @ 11:00 a.m.
  Hello - I have added to the Governor's calendar for tomorrow, Wednesday, 09.05.07 a scheduling
  meeting with all of us for 11:00 a.m. I will have printed out the scheduling requests for September- and
  also a "mock" calendar that lists all scheduling items that we have received for September as of today,
  09.04.07. This will be easier for the governor to vision the requests for each day.

  Kris - I will fax all this up to you this evening. Todd had mentioned that he may want to come into the
  office for this - so I will include him in the email.

  Thank you everyone, Janice
