             Governor & Mike:

             I know you usually are viewing emails through your blackberry - so the

             gist of the attachment is advising ACOA that its actions with regard to

             Commissioner Schmidt bring it close to unfair labor practices. If it

             doesn't cease, I will file an unfair labor practice. This letter is

                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0016276

             signed by the Division Director, but if I file an ULP, I will sign it,

             ratcheting up the response .      Commissioner Schmidt has been provided a

             copy.

             Brad, I just tried to reach you by phone to discuss the attached. I'll
