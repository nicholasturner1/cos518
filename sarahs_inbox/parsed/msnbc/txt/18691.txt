             Good morning Governor,

             I was hoping to spend a few minutes with you while in Juneau but I know how your schedule fills and changes!
             Anyway just in case I miss out I thought I would send a quick note. I am sure you are well aware that I have
             accepted another assignment in Soldotna with the wildlife troopers, this will be something new for me and
             hopefully will offer some new challenges and re-wards. I have truly enjoyed getting to know you and your family
             and will miss some aspects of this assignment; even though I won't be around every day I will count on working
             with you in the future as I will be flying the King Air on a part time basis. I know you are busy so I will keep this
             short but please keep me in mind if you ever need anything and/or are in the Soldotna area, it would be my
             pleasure to help in anyway I can. I will remember you in my prayers and if you ever need input or some confident
             place to vent I would consider it an honor!

             I depart on the 23rd, and not sure if my phone number will change but I will let you know if it does.

             Always at your service
             Shane
