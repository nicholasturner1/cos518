                 Governor:

                 There is an issue with the Seldovia Village Tribe. The Tribe is refusing to sign the standard waiver of tribal
                 sovereign immunity that is required when receiving state funds to administer grants. I believe the waiver is
                 required by statute or DHSS regulation.

                The grant funds in this case are $30,000 for a seniors meals program. The Tribe's position is that its assets
                should not be put at risk in a lawsuit by a waiver of immunity for such a small grant In a letter dated October 29,
                2007, the Tribe asks you to accept a substitute such as naming the state as an insured, or simply quit requiring
                waivers any longer from Tribes for grants under $100,000.

                Channel 2 has contacted DHSS and been sent a copy of the Tribe's October 29, 2007 letter. I also believe DHSS
                told the reporter that these types of waivers have been required as a condition of receiving grant funds for many
                years and the requirements are in statute or regulation or both. I am not sure if this will develop into an actual
                story.

                I am meeting with Talis, Monica, and DHSS personnel tomorrow to discuss.
