               Governor- I received a call from Jim Bowles office , Conoco Phillips asking that a meeting be set up between you
               and Mr. Bowles in regards to Gas pipeline . Mr. Bowles would be available to be in Juneau on Thurs/Fri.
               11.15/11.16. Joe Balash has recommended this as Mr. Bowles would more than likely be stating what they are
               going to do and we need to hear this.

              The Lt. Gov will be attending the Wreath-Laying Ceremony on Veterans Day and will be presenting a Wreath on
              your behalf. This is located © Ft. Richardson Cemetery.

               Kris has talked with RGA today and unfortunately they do not take care of spouses . Thanks, Janice
