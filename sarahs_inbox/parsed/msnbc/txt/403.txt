Hi Kari, this is a personal request, so you won't hurt my feelings

by saying no way, no how, but I am now on the board of the local

snowmachine club and just wanted to reach out to Todd that if he is

in town and has any interest in joining our group and cause, we

would sure welcome him.

We are currently working hard to obtain some corridors to access the

out of bounds areas up at Eaglecrest and are working through the

Eaglecrest board to try and make that happen.

I think Todd would provide us with some great insight on how we may

be able to increase our riding areas in Juneau.

Our website is http://juneausnowmobileclub.googlepages.com/home2 and

if you feel comfortable relaying this information to him we would be

most appreciative. If you are not comfortable, I understand 100%

and will try another approach.

Thanks
