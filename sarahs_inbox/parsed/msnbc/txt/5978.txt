          Governor,



          One more item. I talked to Ivy about Dan Saddler. She just returned from a boards and
          commissions training session held by NGA. Of course she feels that she now has the
          information to do the job without a deputy. I basically told her no choice, we needed the
          help.  I was thinking that Dan can also work with Mark to start developing electronic
          newsletters.  I will give Dan a call tomorrow.



          Mike
