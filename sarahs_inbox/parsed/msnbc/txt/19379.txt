         Hopefully we can provide information in being proactive to show what other Governor's
         travel has been and w/family. Remember that story not long ago that compared and showed
         the large difference between Palin and Murkowski? This is so ridiculus. We're talking
         about a Governor who had the state buy tickets on hotwire saving hundreds of dollars
         rather than just going w/the norm (much more expensive ) or the fact that she often drives
         to the Peninsula or Fairbanks or the fact that her family rarely travels w/her when most
         of the invitations are for first family. Not to mention the majority of the time she flies
         commercial (and not first class!!)

          Remind him of the family travels w me that I have personally pd for, including with
          mileage. Hopefully our records very clearly show that. Also, my return of every per diem
          offer for everything related to the kids. . .and we need to be proactive in this.issue with
          reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage apartment-no
          chef... security down from 7 to 2, whatever- I'm sorry you have to deal w this w the FOIA
          even, I know I'm tired of it already. It is important to know though that probably a week
          doesn't go by without me asking if all the rules are being followed, if the Palin family
          is doing everything right with our travel, etc as First Family.

          Another significant thing here, to me anyway, was the exclusion of my 17-yr old son (now
          19) from all but two First Family events (he traveled to Juneau twice is all in these two
          yrs and I think I ended up paying for one of the trips myself), I was told it was because
          he wasn't going to school in Juneau, which never made much sense to me but I didn't argue
          the fact he is a member of the family too.

           Pis show the travels of the previous Govs so he can compare- incl the fact previous Govs
           took family vacations WITH our security guys so they could take advantage of their rental
           cars, etc (this is according to Bob and Gary), compare that to me never having done this.

          We have to be proactive on this so pls let me know if you need any further info.

          Governor-




          Linda Perez and I both spoke with Kyle today. He has filed a, public records request for
          all of your travel and your family's travel. He is really digging into the travel regs.
          He wants to know where it is spelled out where/when a family member can travel. I told him
          AGAIN that there is a certain expectation that the First Family make public appearances
          and participate in community activities as part of protocol. I am blue in the face with
          this guy! I told him that the Governor receives on average 200 requests each month and
          more than half extend the invitation to the First Family. I also reminded him that you
                                                          2

         prefer to travel by car and the kids aren 't always with you.        Somehow I don't think that
         will make it in the paper.

         I have not been informed of.any phone calls to my office. Do u know if I am to return any
         calls or do anything on this? I sure hope nothing is written that we have to react to,
         based on adn having misinformation or not enough info.

         BTW, this trip I'm taking to NGA with family is being paid by NGA because it's some annual
         family-invitation event for the nation's governors. I'm right on that, am I, Kris?

                 I just spoke with Mr. Nizich after I forwarded this to him. Hesaid I should go
           ahead and let you know directly.  He says your office has also received phone inquiries on
           travel in the last 24 hours from the ADN as well. This is just to give you a fuller

           Importance: High



           CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE



           I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially
           was looking for a copy of the 2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft. He
           had. located the opinion online just as I called back. He then said he was looking into
           the question of when a governor's family could travel at state expense and asked whether
           there was: any other opinion on this issue. I advised generally that a family member might
           travel at state expense if the member was to attend an official function (he said for
           example the inauguration), and that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this
           point.



           He then wanted to know whether there was a statute, regulation or other guidance defining
           what would be an official function or state business. I advised that I was not aware of
           any.  It would likely depend on the circumstance and the involved official's authority.
           He also asked who would decide and I suggested again it would likely be addressed in the
           circumstances on a case by case basis by the governor's office.



           He did not say or suggest whether he is looking at the question with respect to Governor
           Palin or :a former governor.
