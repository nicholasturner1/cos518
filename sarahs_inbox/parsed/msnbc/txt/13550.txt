             Foster would be happy to talk about this if Shelia wants to chat with him, per Tibbles.

             Okay-



             I am pretty sure that the Foster fundraising stuff won't make it in the ear. If by chance
             it does - we will be in there refuting it. I reminded Sheila of the bill signing in
             Foster's office WITH HIS SON. I also told her that Todd called Foster in the hospital. I
             told her that the thought of the governor refusing to do anything to help him is sick. She
             agreed.



             What is definitely going to make it in this weekend is that fact that Tuckerman threatened
             Linda Menard!  Sheila is not going to contact Tuckerman before it runs. And yes, I am
             smiling as I write this. J
