                Subject: Capitol Creep


             Good day! Next week I will be in Ketchikan speaking to the Ketchikan Rotary (Tuesday). I'm
             told a group of 15 people from Juneau will fly in for the meeting and I expect them to ask
             questions about "Capitol Creep." Can you let me know how you have been addressing such
             questions, if at all, or if you have any suggestions for me. (Particularly as it relates to the PPT
             special session).

             The only other related question I anticipate would have to do with the Marine Highway System
             headquarters remaining in Ketchikan. I don't anticipate you changing AMHS headquarters
             back to Juneau, but if asked the question do you have anything I should say or know? Thanks!

             Sean
