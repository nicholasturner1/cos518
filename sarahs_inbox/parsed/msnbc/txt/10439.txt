             Neither Todd nor I have heard of him. Ugh- both Ak industry companies (bp and cp) are
             engaging in a pretty full-scale attack. Lighting a fuse is the way to temper what's coming
             from their pr people on down to their employees.

             Thought I'd check with you to see if you or Todd know this BP employee

             before I light a fuse and get pretty strong with him??? :) Sean

             Message :                          Dear Sean,




             Many of us wonder why you are so silent with regards to the raging

             debate on oil

             and gas taxes and a gas pipeline? You appear to be following happily as
                                                                 1

             Palin

             leads this state towards financial disaster .        I have respect for you as

             a person, but

             do you realize that you are now viewed as a tax and spend Democrat?

             That ' s fine,

             but why not just join the Democratic party if that is more aligned with

             your vision?

             I think it would be more honest that trying to masquerade as a

             Republican.



             Sincerely,

             Bryce
