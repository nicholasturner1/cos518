              ironically, Andrew has used the term "glittering generalities " referring to the Admin in
              the past . Well Kurt held his feet to the fire and made him explain the points Andrew has
              used for almost a year.  Two points:



              1.  Andrew said he's heard from DC that there are other projects that the feds could push
              along, that didn't take the kind of support ours may from the Feds. Kurt asked if Andrew
              knew which projects were on the federal radar to move forwards. Andrew said he's heard of
              9 other locations to get energy, so when pressed where they were, Andre started to
              stumble.  He said "well maybe Colorado", to which Kurt replied "Colorado is very sensitive
              environmentally right now, so what are the others?". Andrew didn't have much so Kurt
              said, "okay, so you just throw things out there and don't back them up with facts. I see
              how it works, okay."



             2.  Andrew talked about how TC was probably lobbying the halls of congress for loan
             guarantees or bridge guarantees, and asked how this fit in the framework of AGIA. Kurt
             explained that they are a large company that moves over 15B of gas a day, and they're
             going to look at all options out there, but that this in no way was a contingency that the
             project rested on.  Andrew had no credible comeback.



              He also answered the piece about bullet line/in state use saying that this Governor's
              focus was moving this project forward for Alaskans to get AK's gas to market, and AGIA is
              the path to accomplish exactly that.



             He was cool, succinct, credible, and honestly talked over Andrew's head, which is
                                                                    1

               I don't think I have EVER heard someone stump and put Andrew on the defense like is
              happening right now on Andrew's show.



               Point after point after point, Andrew is flailing. For once there is someone in the room
              smarter than Andrew.
