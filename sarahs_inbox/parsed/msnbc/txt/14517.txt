            Governor,




            Fran called me with news that is embargoed until tomorrow. She asked that I let you know
            Conoco Phillips donated $15 million to the University and as such the Integrated Science
            Building will be named the "Conoco Phillip's Integrated Science Building". The building
            will be named tomorrow.  The event is at loam tomorrow, but she is not expecting you to
            attend at this last minute notice. She just you to know the news before it hit.



            She also asked that I let you know that this is not the same building that is in the
            capital budget.  That building is the health building.
