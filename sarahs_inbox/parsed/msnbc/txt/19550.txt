                      Please find letter dated July 17, 2008 that was just received via email from
          Mayor Whitaker in response to the letter he received from the Attorney General. The
          signed letter is attached.




           Dear Attorney General Colberg:



          Thank you for your letter dated July 10, 2008 . The Fairbanks North Star Borough sincerely
          appreciates Governor Palin's commitment to finding solutions to Alaska ' s energy crisis.



          Your letter suggests that your office has taken, at most, a purely advisory role with
          regard to the pricing of cook Inlet natural gas (CI gas). You state that there has been
          "no action" and "no decision." Although it may be true that the State's intervention in
          various regulatory proceedings is not the only factor behind cheap CI gas, there is no
          question that your office has consistently advocated for a non-market price under the
          public interest pretext of protecting Anchorage "domestic supply needs."



          Our point is that this advocacy, apart from anything else the State is doing with respect
          to CI gas, runs directly counter to Article VIII of our Constitution.



          But your office's regulator advocacy is not our only complaint. We also have legal
          concerns regarding 11 AAC 03.010(e), a regulation that prohibits export of royalty CI gas
          absent a finding regarding intrastate (i.e., Anchorage) demand.   This regulation clearly
          does not maximize the return on the state's royalty gas. Similarly, approval of the sale
          of royalty gas to ML&P at excessively low prices runs counter to the Constitution and
          statute.  And there are other examples where state action runs directly counter to
          constitutional and statutory requirements.



          If the State were truly committed to maximizing gas royalties, it would advocate for a
          market price for CI gas. There's no doubt that a higher return on CI gas would directly
          stimulate more private investment, exploration and production in Cook Inlet than
          artificial price suppression combined with leveraged agreements with the producers.



          You note that Fairbanks may be a beneficiary of below-market CI gas. Whether or not

                                                                  i




                                                                                                                  PRA GSP01_0021019

           Fairbanks receives such de minimis benefit does not change the legal reality that the
           State's advocacy and other actions regarding CI gas are ripe for legal challenge.



           Nevertheless, as long as there is positive movement toward a more equal distribution of
           the state's energy resources, we remain committed to working with the Administration and
           legislators on remedying the disparate impact that Alaska's energy crisis has on the
           Interior.



           Sincerely, Jim Whitaker, Mayor
