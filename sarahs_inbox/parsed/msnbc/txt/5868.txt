        Subject :    Mr. Palin's visit to willow

        Hello, I am just wondering if Mr Palin has had a chance to see if he will be able to visit
        Willow School

        on April 20. I know he is very busy and the weather has detained travel this past week.
        I am hoping you

        can call or email as soon as he knows .              I don't mean to rush, yet I will need to try and
        find a

        replacement if he can ' t make it .        Thank you ,   Erica ,   for your help and understanding. Ann
        Knobbe
