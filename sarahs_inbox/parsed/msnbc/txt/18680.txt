              Board of Alaska Home Educators Alliance:

              The Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development is going to have a one hour work session
              on September 20th on statewide correspondence schools. It is an information session for the board
              with presentations by several State Department of Education personnel, and an opportunity for Board
              members to ask questions and to discuss. It is not the intent of the Board to hammer out any
              modification or eradication of regulations regarding statewide correspondence. Therefore, we are not
              asking for any participation by members of the pubic.

              The Board is on a tight agenda, and we shall be sticking to the time allotments as closely as possible.
              There are any number of issues before the Board, and each one deserves full time and consideration.
             There will be time to testify at the beginning of the meeting as always. Testimony from interested
             parties on any agenda or non-agenda item is encouraged; however, again time will be an issue. It
             would be helpful if your organization would select two or three people to testify who would represent
             the home school community.
             Thank you.
             Esther J. Cox
             Alaska Board of Education and Early Development
             Chairg
