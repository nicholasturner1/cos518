               Subject: education remarks for tomorrow 10 06 07
               Governor:

               Barbara Thompson is helping with remarks so that you can attend the Secondary School Principals
               Association meeting tomorrow.

               We will have something to you by late this afternoon.

               Barbara will also attend the meeting. Here's the information below.
               Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals to give a welcome. This is
               the 41st Annual Fall Principals Conference.  The Conference started on Sunday
               and goes through Tuesday, 10.16.07. I explained to the Executive Director
               that you were not available to do a Q and A on the panel. They are requesting
               just a brief welcome to the group. They have given us two times to work
               with.  Either @ 10:00 a.m. right before General Session begins or @ 12:30 p.m.
               - they will break for lunch at that time. Expected attendance is 300-400.

               Location:     ANC - Sheraton Hotel
