               I think my actions will speak louder than words anyway... and Cockerham was seemingly
               stirring this up more than was justifed.



              I'm glad for this wee bit of controversy over the issue - it let's me say "no" to
              additional requests.

              AARRGGH - Sean took my comment out of context.            I never mentioned Green,

              Hawker and Samuels.

             No, despite what the paper said today, I would not be intersted in

              raising funds for Lyda, or Samuels, or Hawker... or other elected

               Just fyi.
