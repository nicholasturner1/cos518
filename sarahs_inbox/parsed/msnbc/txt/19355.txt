             Guys, I may be pretty wimpy about this family stuff, but I feel like I'm at the breaking point with
             the hurtful gossip about my family that Sherry and others get away with. Bear with me. I hate
             this part of the job and many days I feel like it's not worth it when they have to put up with the
             hate that spews from people like Sherry, and there are others.

             Below is the email Don sent to ADN. It's not much, but we were trying to bring there attention
             to this ongoing and very frustrating situation. Her comments are downright libelous. You're
             right-she's a crazy hater.

               Hey,



               Cut the body of this email and paste into a new email and send to content@adn.com.



               Dear Sir or Madam,



               I'm writing to bring your attention to the increasingly inapropriate comments posted by
               the blogger syrin. Every day she posts comments that have absolutely no bearing on
               policy. For example, today the ADN posted a positive story on the national press
               Governor Palin is receiving, yet syrin accuses the governor of having an affair or makes
               hateful comments about her young children. I don't often feel compelled to write, but
               syrin's comments are never on topic, nor are they civil as is stated in the terms of use.



               Thank you for your time.




              9/18/2009

              The state is paying for travel to NGA as is customary w/invitations to first family events such as NGA's invitation
              and agenda shows for family events. With probably 50% or more of requests we receive; they request the first
              family while I'm guessing that only portions of the family attend and do so minimally.

                  I just spoke with Mr. Nizich after I forwarded this to him. He said I should go ahead and let you know directly.
              He says your office has also received phone inquiries on travel in the last 24 hours from the ADN as well. This is

             I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially was looking for a copy of the
             2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft. He had located the opinion online just as I called back. He then said
             he was looking into the question of when a governor's family could travel at state expense and asked whether there was any
             other opinion on this issue. I advised generally that a family member might travel at state expense if the member was to
             attend an official function (he said for example the inauguration), and that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this
             point.

             He then wanted to know whether there was a statute, regulation or other guidance defining what would be an official function
             or state business. I advised that I was not aware of any. It would likely depend on the circumstance and the involved
             official's authority. He also asked who would decide and I suggested again it would likely be addressed in the circumstances
             on a case by case basis by the governor's office.

             He did not say or suggest whether he is looking at the question with respect to Governor Palin or a former governor.

         I am a high school teacher in Fairbanks, Alaska. I teach math (everything from geometry
         to calculus), am a cross-country running coach, and the father of a 3.5 year old and a six
         month old.



           I was the Academic Decathlon        (ACADECA) coach at West Valley for many years(counting my
         bride's time coaching and mine         it has been 10 years). We have been very successful,
         winning the state championship        3 of the last four years. We are having a "good bye picnic
         with students from the last 10        years at the end of July".




         I'm writing because ACADECA is an ideal way to motivate rural students for exellence.
         Unfortunately, with budget cuts, fewer rural schools are participating in the state
         competition which is sponsered by G.C.I.

          the state competition.

             I have not been informed of any phone calls to my office. Do u know if I am to return any calls
             or do anything on this? I sure hope nothing is written that we have to react to, based on adn
             having misinformation or not enough info.
             BTW, this trip I'm taking to NGA with family is being paid by NGA because its some annual
    i        family-invitation event for the nation's governors. I'm right on that, am I, Kris?

             Dear Governor Palin,

                 I just spoke with Mr. Nizich after I forwarded this to him. He said I should go ahead and let you know
             directly. He says your office has also received phone inquiries on travel in the last 24 hours from the
             ADN as well. This is just to give you a fuller picture of what may be happening in the news world. Tails

             Importance: High

             CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

             I just returned a phone call from Kyle Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News who initially was looking for a
             copy of the 2004 opinion addressing travel on the King Air aircraft. He had located the opinion online just
             as I called back. He then said he was looking into the question of when a governor 's family could travel at
             state expense and asked whether there was any other opinion on this issue . I advised generally that a
             family member might travel at state expense if the member was to attend an official function (he said for
             example the inauguration), and that I could not recall other opinion or guidance on this point

             He then wanted to know whether there was a statute , regulation or other guidance defining what would be
             an official function or state business. I advised that I was not aware of any . It would likely depend on the
             circumstance and the involved official 's authority. He also asked who would decide and I suggested
             again it would likely be addressed in the circumstances on a case by case basis by the governor 's office.

            He did not say or suggest whether he is looking at the question with respect to Governor Palin or a former
            governor.
