            Mike, Gov . Palin spoke with Congressman Young this morning about her concerns regarding funding for the
            Minneapolis bridge tragedy . Please inform the Gov. that Congressman Young's friend and colleague and the new
            chairman of the House Transportation Committee, James Oberstar of Minnesota, rushed a bill through the
            Committee today that would take $250 million from the general treasury rather than the Highway Trust Fund to go
            towards the Minneapolis bridge reconstruction . Coincidentally, when Congressman Young was the chairman of
            Transportation, he and Congressman Oberstar made an emergency account for situations like this in the
            SAFETEA-LU highway law. Unfortunately , tragedies like the bridge collapse in California have drained the
            emergency funding from that account. So, please let the Gov . know that Congress will be sure that the folks in
            Minnesota will be taken care of.

            Thanks,

            Jeremy
