        I am so incredibly proud of everyone on this Alaskan team. Thank you all for everything -
        the work ethic displayed by eveyone is incredible and admirable - and surely unsurpassed
        by any other admin team.



        Hang in there! I'm anxious for the session to wind down (w/no desire for special session -
        but if legislators believe one's warranted for agia approach then we'd conduct it in
        anch.), and then we will start conducting a chunk of continued administrative work out of
        southcentral Ak, where it will be easier to all stay connected.



        I appreciate everyone's sacrifices made here - especially w/time/travel logistics that are
        so difficult. It will become more practical and less costly soon!



        You, and those working w/you, are an amazing team of true Alaskans w/servants hearts.



        Thanks so much,

        Sarah



        Sarah Palin

        I would like to echo that! I was at dinner last night at Consul

        Uchiyama's.     Gov Rickel & Ermalee, and a number of other folks were

        there.     Everyone was so proud of this administration and the wonderful

        job our Governor is doing. And, they specifically mentioned Meg &

        Sharon and the great job they are doing as well.




                                                                1
