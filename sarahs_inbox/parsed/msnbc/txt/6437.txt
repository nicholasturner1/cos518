              Subject: Bridge Builders

            FYI, Elsa Sargento (formerly of the Alaska State Community Service Commission) is the President of Bridge
            Builders and Angelina Burney (from Commerce) is the Vice President. From what I learned today, you will be
            sitting at Elsa's table. Also, Reverend Patterson from Shiloh will be performing the Invocation. He is sifting with
            Malcolm Roberts.

           Janice told me that she spoke w/you and it is not necessary that I staff tomorrow evening's event. I did want to let
           you know that I (and Clark) will be there, although at a different table. Pastor Thomas Davis invited us to attend.

           This afternoon Sharon gave me a copy of the event overview and speech for you. I'll drop off at your house
           tomorrow early afternoon.

           Also, I will not be in the office on Monday. Tibbles is aware . I will be back in the office Tuesday afternoon. While
           out, I'll be connected via phone and email.

           Thanks,
           Kris
