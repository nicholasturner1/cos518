         Hope you made it home ok and enjoyed South Carolina ! Attached is the letter I mentioned
         your Governor wrote opposing the amendments to the Airborne Hunting Act . Excellent
         letter . I have also invited Governor Palin to join us at the NRA Firearm Seminar during
         our NRA annual meeting in Kentucky next year . Thanks for the idea . She will be a breath
         of fresh air ! You should plan on joining us for lunch during the Law Seminar ( Friday) and
         sit with her . We would love to have you join us . Best, Carol
