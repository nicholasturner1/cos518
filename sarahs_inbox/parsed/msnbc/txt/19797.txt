               It sounds like the questions relate to distribution formulas by the PFD.

               Director of PFD or Jerry Burnett?

               Subject: From newt a question

               Someone recommended to me that we study the alaskan model of revenue distribution back to the citizens and get
               bills introduced in the state legislature in california florida and elsewhere that if they do go to offshore drilling they
               should split the revenue stream with a specified amount (maybe half) going to the citizens as a direct benefit
                How much does each alaskan get?
                What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the citizens?
                Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me?

               Would you be interested in writing or talking about this?
               Thanks
               Newt
