             Burke ' s going to hit this this afternoon .         He's got some good lines of thought on how
             ridiculous this is.

             What ' s the beef Fagan is supposedly making over my 6pm speech ? AP told me Lyda is fussing
             about it , said she may not come , Harris ( er, John Bitney ) reportedly wants a detailed
             explanation . AP asked if I really had a plane to catch - (how would they even know this?!).
             I explained the speech has been set for a month - and-a -half, no one complained back then...
             and my flt to travel to attend my son ' s graduation into the Infrantry was made AFTER the
             speech time was set.
