              Governor,

              I'm a little confused about the luncheon. When Todd was in Jnu. He selected a date then
              changed it to possibly Fri. 3/28; I have emailed him and am waiting for him to confirm a
              date.  I have everything lined up and ready to go (invitations and addresses). Will this
              be something more then a lunch with round tables and floral center pieces?

              Thank you.

              Erika

              I still think a legislative spouses' luncheon is a good idea - I'm happy to host it, and
              Ivy and Kris can help entertain (!). Kris may want to work the day in the Juneau office
              anyway on a variety of things.



              it could go a long way in building Leg relationships.



              Who wants to take this and run with it? Doesn't have to be a big darn deal, and I'd like
              it sooner rather than later. Thanks, all.
