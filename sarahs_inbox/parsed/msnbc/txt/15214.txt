             If this was another leak Annette, DOA needs to do something. I may be asking you to Track
             it down today- this was an internal email from steve to all commissioners. It ended up in
             reporters' hands. Not good, again.

            We've had a few emails end up in reporters and leggies' hands this past week. Anyone know
            how the press got ahold of Steve's email from Friday, asking for input on energy plan?
