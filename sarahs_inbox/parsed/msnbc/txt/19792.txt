            Governor:



            I just got off the phone with Meghan Stapleton.   She is sending an addendum about the
            rural trips that mentions those trips we know occurred that she has been able to confirm.
            Do you want to see this before I send it on to Megan Holland? Or, as Meghan has
            suggested , can I send it in anew seperate e-mail to Megan?

            Thank you . Best if has mayor porter and manager koch with him. He MUST be candid , honest
            and must ask to be held accountable because he has nothing to hide as he tells truthfully
            of the situation... is my opinion based on what I've been told. I have no reason to NOT
            believe him based on info I am aware of... now Alaskans need to hear clearly why he is to
            be believed. Solid and strong and truthful. (I hope he realizes how bad some folks want to
            crucify us - he needs to be strong. )

           Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at public
           safety.



           It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a
           memo from the City of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when the
           allegation/complaint came into the department the city removed Chuck from all supervisory
           duties. They made it quite sinister as you can expect like there is still something that
           he and the city was hiding.



            I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk
           through this with me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on the.
           phone with the City of Kenai attorney's office working on a strategy.



           The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human resource
           response when you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to
           sexual harassment, you remove immediately the person from the any of supervisory duties
           (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this woman) until you can substantiate or
           unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the claim and
           eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.



           Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with
           what he can and set the record straight. He will have the city Mayor by his side and she
           will attest to the situation in favor of Chuck. Privileged or Personal Material Red acted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


           That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call
           me in the morning with some more follow up.

            My understanding , just based on short convo with Kris , is that Kopp got an attorney and is
            going to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai
            woman ? And the kenai mayor will be standing with him? If there are any details I need to
            hear them- like when this will take place , what prompted this new action, etc.

               He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've
            had very good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
