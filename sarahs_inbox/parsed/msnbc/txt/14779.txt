            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            My wife and I wish to congratulate you on the arrival of the latest member of your family.
            We read the news article relating that your son Trig was born with Down's. We understand
            and appreciate the situation as our daughter Kelsey was also born with Down's - Kelsey
            will soon be 10 months old and is the greatest joy in our lives that we could ever ask to
            have happen for us.



            Trig will teach your family and you much about yourselves and more about the rest of the
            world - may that knowledge serve you all well in the years to come.



            You have our sincere best wishes and we hope that you will continue to serve your state
            and should the opportunity present , the nation as well.



            Sincerely,



            David and Cindy Rhodes
