            Mr Allen was at our recent board earlier this month and shared their desire in person. We
            are in the process of getting an appraisal on the Palmer property so that we can move
            forward . I agree it would be nice if they were to get it and also agree they need to bid
            on it accordingly

            Met with Palmer officials - they sure want MatMaid property in downtown Palmer . I said I
            knew that - and it ' d be great if they got it, I promised to pass this along to Kristan...
            and that they should bid higher than anyone else on the property in order to secure it!
