           Subject:                 Letters


           Do we know if someone's keeping up with thank you letters and acknowlegements? I haven't
           seen any lists for, it seems like, months. Is there a better way for me to know what
           constituent relations work is being done - like acknowledgement of citizens excelling at
           something, citizens taking the time to write letters to the editor, etc? I'm still trying
           to clip newsworthy items, incl letters, to send to whomever has time to acknowledge tham -
           but I know I'm not keeping up and I never know if anyone's followed up with the citizen.
           In Anchorage I ask Tara and Colleen to help me with some of it, can the new gal in the
           Juneau Comm office also take this on? Pls task her with that if it helps me keep up with
           constituent work. Thanks

          Also, with so many emails that we get re: citizens who are ill and their friends or
          families pass on the news, I hope they're not just getting that general reply re: "Due to
          the volume of mail we received, the gov can't respond to everyone..." I hope they're
          getting something more personal/thoughtful in reply. Is there any progress there?
