                            The Governor does not think that the state should have to pay for the costs associated
                            with the BP shutdown and the replacement of pipes that were not properly maintained.
                            We have been concerned about this issue and it is something that we are weighing very
                            heavily.

                            Thanks,
                            Meg

                          Hey Meg:
                          BP has informed the Legislature today that it plans to seek tax deductions and credits (totaling
                          about $ 11 million, I believe ) for the cost of repair and replacement of leaky Prudhoe Bay pipelines.
                          Any reaction from the administration on this? I'm all ears!
