                  Governor and Lt. Governor:

                  AP report from February 21 titled "Economists: Health care expenses to grow" cites Federal
                  Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt as saying "The only force strong enough to
                  change the course of health care is a marketplace where consumers have the information and
                  incentive to choose quality and keep costs low."

                  This is consistent with revising/removing CON restrictive, monopolistic trade practices and
                  transparency in medical billing/costs.

                  Alaska needs a change.
