            Good. And know that I am willing to work with wagoner and the other folks who have shown
            reasonableness through all these months... those who have good ideas and don't want to kill a
            proposal just because it came from us, vs considering it on its merits. Thank you!

             The supplemental application deals with those who do not request a PFD or who are living in Alaska but
             do not yet qualify for the 2008 dividend . After watching this morning 's committee meeting, it looks like the
             committee wants us to draft new language addressing some of their concerns : fiscal impact of sending
             out an additional checks, and working the application process , the fact that the funds are not subject to
             garnishment, the issue that the check doesn 't deal with the energy crisis but is a resource rebate...

            And, I do believe Wagoner understands the way to get to Roads to Resources and is actively working on
            it.

            We will all work on the package of legislation and try and find a good compromise on the bills.

            Well if they'd support our mission of building roads to our resources then I'd believe the
            legislature recognizes our desire to build infrastructure during this time of surplus! But...
            Their leadership hasn't supported our agenda the past two years so we had to adjust until that
            leadership which controls everything changes.
            And also, what's the supplemental application he doesn't agree with?

              Yesterday I visited with Sen Wagoner for a little while. He wanted to share his strong concerns with the rebate
              legislation. Since this will be front and center next week , it is important to pass along his comments.

                  1)       He'd like to see any approved payment apply to a household only and not to all residents . In fact,
                          he'd like to see the payment go to a person with a utility bill; possibly passing through a utility
                          company.
                  2)       He adamantly disagrees with the supplemental application.
                  3)       If it goes to the floor for a vote as it was introduced , he will not be able to support it and believes
                          others will not as well.
                  4)       His main concerns are the potential entitlement the check creates and he thinks there are other
                          ways to spend the money to assist all Alaskans i.e. infrastructure via roads etc...

              We will probably come across others who share this general opinion.

              Thanks, Kelly
