          senator murkowski issues statement on the shutdown of the gravina island bridge project



         WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senator Murkowski today issued the following statement regarding the
         State's decision to shutdown the Graving Island bridge project:



         "The community of Ketchikan has made safe and reliable access to the airport a priority
         for over 30 years. When the State of Alaska requested resources to build a bridge, the
         Congressional Delegation worked hard to secure funding.



         it is unfortunate for the people of Ketchikan that the State has chosen to reprioritize
         its support of this project.



         I look forward to working with the State to provide the people of Ketchikan an opportunity
         for economic growth and safe and efficient access to their airport."
