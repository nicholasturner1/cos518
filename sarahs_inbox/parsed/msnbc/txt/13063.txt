            Great. Pls see if she can come down here sooner rater than later. Monday? If she's good,
            she's got to fill the role of the Comm boss, and Privil can still come on bd too in the
            Anchorage office if that's still her plan. We reduced Security to 1.5 hourly, on call as
            needed (keeping Bob and Tom part time) - that's confidential until Nizich tells them all
            so we have the funds for beefed up Comm staff now.
