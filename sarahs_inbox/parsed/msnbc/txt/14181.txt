             Sharon- gasline team is very disappointed that someone contacted ADN                    to spin the "PR" firm
             story into something negative. I need you to discreetly find out who                    talked to Sean C
             about this and released it as a negative story. I have a feeling who                    may have done it, to
             make the gasline team look bad, but I need proof of it so I can deal                    with it.

            How did Sean C. think to do a story today in ADN on your solicitation of outside PR firm?
            And are all local firms excluded?



            Wondering how it became a story today, who called him.
