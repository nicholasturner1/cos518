            I thought we already formed the subcabinet with the AO... if it still hasn't been signed then pls
            set that up for a signing to take place in Juneau on Friday. is the AO ready to go?

              Governor,

              I didn't get Kate's email referred to in Tom's email. I suspect she wants a more agressive schedule for the
              State's response to climate change.

              Currently , we are forming workgroups who are advising the subcabinet in particular areas , including.what
              are the most immediate needs in terms of threats to villages and state infrastructure.

              I am currently on my way to Seattle for the Pacific NW Clean Seas (Oil Spill Prevention) conference. I
              will be back in Anchorage late Friday afternoon . Please let me know if you would like to discuss our
              Climate Change actions and opportunities further. I would appreciate this opportunity.

              Larry

              Governor, I thought a lot about whether I should pass this on but decided you would want to see what the
              conservation side is thinking . I don't agree with all the comments but a lot matches our thoughts and I respect Kate.
