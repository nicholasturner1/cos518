                Marty,

                Yesterday I rec'd a phone call from Director Mark Robinson of the Office of Energy Projects w/FERC (he was
                referred to me by Karen Knustson, COS w/Murkowski's office). He, along with Chairman Joseph Kelliher and
                Commissioner Phil Moeller, are planning a trip to Alaska the week of July 21st. He would like to schedule
                meetings with the administration and gasline team for Monday the 218t. He also would like to meet with
                legislators and mentioned contacting Ralph Samuels to facilitate but will hold off until he hears back from us.
                Their plan for the week is that on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, they will visit projects across the state and
                on Friday they will meet with industry folks.

                I mentioned this to the Governor yesterday. We'd like to find out how they will be accomplishing their travels
                across the state as this would be a great opportunity for the Governor and/or gasline team members to
                accompany.

               Director Robinson's phone number is 202-502-8700. 1 told him that either myself or someone from the gasline
               team would get back in touch with him in the next day or so. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to
               assist, otherwise just let me know when he has been contacted.

               Thanks,
               Kris Perry, Director
               Office of Governor Sarah Palin &
               Office of International Trade
