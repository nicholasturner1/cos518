            Subject:                 Dyson


            Sen. Dyson wrote a pretty scathing letter a week or so ago re: no progress on his Native
            Elders Roundtable idea, a year after presenting the idea to the Gov's office.



            Pls provide a copy of the letter to Rhonda, and others who need to see it. Dyson's idea is
            great, but I had assigned the idea to Bitney so he'd work with Dyson on it, and Bitney
            must not have communicated anything on this to Dyson.



            Between Rhonda, the Lt. Governor, and others who think this is a good idea, I'm sure we
            can see something come to fruition on Dyson's idea.



            Thanks



            Alsp- I need DPS letter from Aniak and their response to Aniak re: no troopers wanted in
            the village. Thanks
