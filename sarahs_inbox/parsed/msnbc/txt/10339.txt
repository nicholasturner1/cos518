                Governor.
                I've attached a copy of the Word document with your remarks for Monday , with changes tracked as there are
                some small things that need some attention . I've pasted a few things here that should be changed.

                Thanks so much- I'll get on to reading these asap. Love the title: Slow Govt Growth... that's got to be the silver lining in the
                increased budget message.

                Governor - attached are talking points that Mike and I have been working on today along with two new charts for tomorrow.
                 Beth, the charts are ready to go! There is also the 2-page fiscal summary - it will be one of the handouts that I will go over
                but too much for a chart! Let us know if you would like to walk through this information tomorrow. I flu be here early
                afternoon until I get on the plane! Karen
