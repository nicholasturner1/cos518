         The interview was excellent. She said that the means by which the PPT percentage was
         established neededyo be revisited by both the legis and the administration. She did not
         say outright that was inherently suspect, but that it should be revisited. When asked if
         yesterday's events affected AGIA, she said that this "sad day for the state" ought not be
         used as a form of political expediency to advance this distinct piece of legislation.
         However, she continued, one could not help but recognize how AGIA distinguishes itself as
         a truly open and transparent process.

         I could not find the link. What were the comments ?                Hopefully, you didn't say how much
         you LOVE the net tax in PPT.

         Meg- pls make sure Pat, et al, know of my on-the-record remarks re: PPT that were
         broadcast on KTUtJ last night. Verbatim should be available on KTuu's website? That way
         we're all on same sheet of music. Thanks!
