        Kari,



        I need about 30 minutes of the Governor ' s time Wednesday morning to record

        an interview with Energy TV. The answers would be pre-recorded and we would

        feed on the satellite . Does the Governor have time Wednesday morning?



        Thanks,

        meghan

       Energy TV would like an interview with the Governor and I thought this

        Wednesday might work - the questions are below. What we need to do is simply

        book the Governor's time, provide the answers to the questions below, use

        the prompter and have her look to the side and answer the questions for use

        by the TV station. I just need help on the answers . It needs to be very

        conversationally written. Needs to be on 3:30pm Governor's feed Wednesday -

        could record according to Governor's schedule on Wednesday morning and would

        need answers by tomorrow. Possible?



        Thanks,

        Meg




        Energy-TV is an independently produced television program based in

        Calgary, Alberta, Canada.         The show focuses on the energy sector,

        primarily oil and gas; it began broadcasting in October 2006. Energy-TV

        currently airs in the cities of Calgary, Edmonton, and Red Deer, Alberta;

        it can also be viewed on-line at www.energy-tv.com.



        As of April 7, 2007, Energy-TV will begin airing in Houston, Texas on

        Saturdays at 11a.m., on ABC, with American content. On April 7th,

        Energy-TV will be the lead-in for the NBA play-offs. This first episode

        will be about natural gas; we would very much like to interview Governor

        Palin for this episode.



        The interview could take place at the Governor's office in Washington,

        D.C. and we would need approximately 20 minutes of her time. Given the

        scheduled air date, we would like to conduct the interview by March 28th,

        if at all possible. The questions we propose asking are as follows:



         1)   Can you explain why your government is strongly supporting the

                                                             3




                                                                                                       PRA GSP01_0000729

         development of the North Slope Alaska Pipeline that will carry Alaskan gas

         to both the U.S. and Canada ?         What would the economic losses be for Alaska

         if this project does not proceed?

           2) How important is the Alaskan gas to the future supply equation for the

         U.S.?

          3) Recently ,    the government of Alaska wrote into the Alaska Gasline

         Inducement Act, a capital investment of $500 million ,            for the successful

         applicant or group of applicants to reach regulatory certification. What

         was the reason for including the monetary incentive ?             Has the incentive

         been helping in the regulatory certification process?

          4) What progress has been made so far with the Alaska Gasline Inducement

         Act?     How will that progress assist in the final outlook of the North

         Slope Alaska Pipeline?

          5)    Even if the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act proceeds , what is the

         overview for the project ?        How long would it take for regulatory

         completion ,    construction , and tie-in?

          6) What do you see as the major stumbling blocks in pushing this project

         ahead?

          7)    is your government watching the Mackenzie Valley pipeline application

         in Canada to see what the best strategy is in dealing with so many

         stakeholders ?     If Mackenzie gets a green light, many think that it will

         open the north for both Canada and the U . S., and that the Mackenzie

         project will become the pathway for Canadian gas in the Canadian pipeline,

         soon followed by a U . S. pipeline that would carry U.S . gas.             Is this

         statement correct?       Why or why not?

          8) How would your project tie into Canadian infrastructure?

          9) where would the final destination be for Alaskan gas?

         10) Is there anything else you would like to add for Energy-TV viewers?



         I hope this note provides you with the information you need to respond to

         our request .    Should you have any questions or concerns , please contact me

         at (403 )   444- 5779 or e-mail me at tracy@energy - tv.com.



         Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.
