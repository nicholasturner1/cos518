             MESSAGE:

             Ms. Palin,

                 Just a note to wish you and your family a great 2008 even if I am late. Rush Limbaugh
             mentioned your name today and I was reminded of the fact you are a lifetime member of the
             NRA, a mom and a pioneer first woman governor of Alaska.

             Keep up the good work there. We have Gov. Perdue in Georgia to keep the Democrats in
             check.

             Milton Broome

             Snellville Ga.
