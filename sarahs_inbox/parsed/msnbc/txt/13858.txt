            Pls let them know that. Remember some in Revenue thought we "hijacked" the Perm Fund
            announcement because it came from us instead of them? I tried diplomatically to explain
            that to them.

            As a general rule -- good news comes from the governor's office, bad

            news comes from the commissioners!

            Good news from NYC. The state's bond rating has been upgraded by S&P,

            the first upgrade for the state since 1992. We're preparing a press

            release from DOR. Let me know if you want it to come from the

            Governor's Office.
