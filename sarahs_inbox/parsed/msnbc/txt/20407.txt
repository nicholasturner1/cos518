               Governor, I've contacted the Armed Services YMCA, Army Community Service at Ft. Rich, DMVA (only
               via e-mail - no one answered any of their phones) and Pete Mulcahy, formerly of Armed Services YMCA
               - and he's going to blast e-mail it out to all of his many, many contacts in town.

               I am happy to staff you for this event unless you already have someone else in mind.

              Proceeds from the event will benefit the Family Ties Foundation. The foundation is a non -profit
              organization created to provide immediate support for the military families of wounded service

              event is being hosted by local morning radio personalities Bob and Mark from 106.5 KWHL.

              "My family has been so blessed by the arrival of Trig. It is my honor to share that blessing with
              our men and women in uniform through this event ," Governor Palin said. "I invite all Alaskans
              who'd like to support our wonderful military families to participate."

              The event will take place at Romano's restaurant, on Fireweed Lane at C Street, on Monday from 5
              to 7 p.m. The public is invited. Romano's restaurant will donate a portion of the sales from the
              evening to the Family Ties Foundation.

                                                                   ###
