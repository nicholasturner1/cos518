              Hi Erika- look what I found: and I've been looking for one. Todd is

              permitting me :) to forward to you. Can we get our guys to pick it up,

              if I call them back and say I do want to buy the one with the new bulbs?

             The Juneau Ak Club has a $300 sunbed for sale - with new bulbs!!!

             Please?!    For the Juneau house?! They're standing by to hear back from

             me - our guys could pick it up! Gail @ 789-2181 x 305. She met us at

             Inaugural Ball. They have three of them for sale, but one has the new

             bulbs.




             If "yes", we pay for it ourselves and could you forward to Erika so she

             could help hook us up?!
