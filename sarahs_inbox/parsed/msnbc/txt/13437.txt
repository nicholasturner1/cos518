            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                             I wish lawmakers would
            have adopted more relief measures than PCE funding and weatherization measures. We·'ll keep
             you in the loop on what where we can go with all this for rural and urban areas.

                Dear Governor Palin,
                First, congratulations on the birth of your child. Aren't they amazing! Please do not veto the
                money for the Fire Island wind project. With a gasline still a few years away and demand
                always on the rise, renewable sources are a great way to bridge that gap and diversify our power
                sources for the future. If its the bottom line you're worried about, taking money from the
                controversial Juneau road extension would more than cover this broadly-supported project.
                Thank you, and best wishes for your family,
                Mark Gnadt
                Barrow
