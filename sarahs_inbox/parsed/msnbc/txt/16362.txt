             Sure. Don't know how they figure their guests "compete", but whatever!

             Governor-



             After much debate with their corporate execs, CNBC has asked us to put the interview that
             was scheduled for the afternoon, back on the schedule. Please let me know if this is okay
             with you.



             If so - it was be CNBC at 2:10 ish and FOX News about 2:40 ish.
