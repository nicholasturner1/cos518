             What's not helping is (allegedly) Rep. Young traveling the state asking for a "show of
             hands for those who appreciate our earmarks" in different community settings... Then
             seeing the majority of hands raised - to respond "Tell that to you Gov, she says we
             shouldn't provide earmarks".



             Now, granted, this report came back to me from Homer's Mayor Hornaby- and I don't think
             he's a fan of Young's (and I know he's not a fan of mine), but the mixed messages from
             anyone is causing confusion on all this. Just fyi.

            I agree with you about the mixed messages coming from the delegation.   On the one hand,
            they have encouraged us to reduce the number of earmarks and to provide matching funds.
            On the other hand, they seem to be saying that we no longer have confidence in their power
            and credibility when we do this.



            Regarding your second point, we have been working with Randy Ruaro to make sure that the
            Congressional delegation understands the reasons for DOTPF's proposed earmark policy.



            Concerning your third point , many of the local communities will soon make their annual
            pilgrimage to DC , and we will have an additional opportunity to talk with them about
            earmark policy .  In my opinion , they really aren ' t adversely affected by what we're doing
            in DC.

             Thanks John - the discussion over earmarks is going down several tracks here -

             1.  State legislators want WRITTEN guidelines from the governor on what is acceptable
             under "state earmarks ", the criteria the governor will use to evaluate projects, etc.I
             have been asked on the record - twice now - to produce such a document

             2.  Mayors from all over the state were here with AML and fussing about the DOTPF's
             revised earmark policy that was sent to the Congressional Delegation in draft form
             regarding those community requests that are not sufficient to fund the project and what
             the state ' s role is in that; and

            3.  The State of Alaska ' s federal funding requests and our desire to link state and
            federal interests and priorities in narrowing the number of requests we submit to the
            delegation.

            And, I think there have been some confusing messages from the delegation about what the
            state should be doing versus what communities and organizations should continue to do in
            terms of seeking federal funds directly from them.

            So, I expect there will be resistance to virtually anything we are trying to do - KJR

             I don 't think that there will be a moratorium on earmarks , but the attached statements,
             which are still evolving, provide additional impetus to the Governor ' s federal earmark
             policy.




             In particular , the President ' s demand to reduce earmarks , the need for greater
             transparency, and more intense interests in matching funds all rebut the comments of Karl
             Marrs and others who appear wedded to past practices.
