          I really want to do absolutely everything I can to help push these things forward so you
         don't have to. I used to be afraid of getting fired , but what the hey I can always make
         latte ' s. Seriously tho, if there ' s any way you see for Kris or I to push forward on these
         items ( and I ' ll watch as well )- don't hesitate to point me in the right direction if I
         don't pick up on it.
