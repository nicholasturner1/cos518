              You speak at 10:00 am at the Sheraton. Harris is at 11:30 and McBride at 1:30. These
              latter meetings came up yesterday afternoon when Janice was out so we'll get them added
              today. She'll be here this morning.

             Also, i still need to see any tentative events /invitations so i can start picking and
             choosing what I can attend, to allow me plenty of time to prepare for events, esp the
             speeches . Thanks.
