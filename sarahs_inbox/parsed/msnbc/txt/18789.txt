          FYI.     Don't know what kind of wiggle room you have in the schedule.

          Joe,



          Any interest in having the governor visit the terminal or SERVS while she's in Valdez
          tomorrow?  Mainly an inquiry from some of our employees in Valdez who heard she was coming
          to the Civic Center to make the big PFD announcement.




          Let me know if there is interest. We'd be happy to show her around.




          Mike
