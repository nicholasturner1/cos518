         J - pls put on sched in case i can tune into their strat sessions also.



         also, bristol said she called you         about First Daughters/First Family events next week in
         juneau? i want them to be able to         come with me - can bristol do that Teenage Safe Driving
         thing that she was invited to do?         maybe willow too, as she'll get her permit in the
         summer? there may be other first          family things that are due for them in juneau next
         week...



         it's a shame we have to seek reasons for the kids to get to be with me at the Governor's
         House ... i wish that rule would be more understandable.
