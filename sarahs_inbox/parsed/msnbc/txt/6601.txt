           Dear Mr. and Ms. Simon:

           Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging response
           to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.

           I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
           under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.

           I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget
           goals to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.

           I appreciate hearing from you!

                                                  Sincerely,

                                                  Sarah Palin
                                                  Governor

           Dear Governor Palin. Kudos to you and your staff for the cuts to the budget. You kept your word and
           maybe the Legislature will wise up. Your courage should inspire True Alaskans to consider whats good
           for our state. We look forward to the same review next year. We wish you a safe and enjoyable 4th of
           July holiday, its time for a break. Greetings from the Nelchina, Herb & Jackie, Nelchina
