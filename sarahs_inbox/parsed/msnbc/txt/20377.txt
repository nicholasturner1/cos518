           Governor -




           I just received an email from RNC. They have confirmed your speech for Thursday,
           September 4, 2008 (evening).  They are not able to confirm the time as of yet - approx.
           8:00 or 9:00 p.m. So, that will mean some changes to the flight schedule I had just
           emailed.  We will have to return you on Friday, September 5, 2008. The flight times
           remain the same. You will then be out of state from Monday, 09.01 through Friday,
           09.05.08.  Janice
