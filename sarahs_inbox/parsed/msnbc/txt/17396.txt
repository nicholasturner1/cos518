                 SUBJECT: Briefing paper regarding Alyeska meeting 3/28/07

               The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company was established in 1970 and charged with
               designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the Trans Alaska Pipeline System,
               commonly called TAPS.

               The consortium of companies that own TAPS today includes:
               BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc.                        46-93%
               Conoco Phillips Transportation Alaska, Inc .      28.29%

               things stand with regard to their strategic reconfiguration project which began in 2001.
               The program goal is to position TAPS for more efficient operation while maintaining or
               enhancing safety, operational integrity and environmental performance . In 2006, a
               decision was made to focus on converting one station at a time . Pump Station 9 near
               Delta junction was selected as the first station to upgrade . It will be followed by Pump
               Station 3, Pump Station 4 and Pump Station 1.

               Attending the meeting will be Kevin Hostler , President & CEO. He is the ninth
               executive to lead Alyeska since the company was established. Prior to joining Alyeska,
               he served as the Senior Vice President for BP 's global human resource organization. He
               has had a diverse 29-year career in the Oil and Gas Industry , including 26 years with
               BP. He has had leadership assignments in the United States, England, Scotland, and
               Columbia.
