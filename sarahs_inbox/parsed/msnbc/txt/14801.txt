            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governer Palin,



            Congratulations to you and your husband on your new son. I saw a picture and he is
            beautiful. The story I read about it was so wonderful.



            I just want to say thank you. Thank you for taking this stand, seeing that there is a
            purpose in this child's life and doing what was right despite what others may say.



            I pray the Lord's richest blessings upon you and your family. You are a true inspiration
            all the way across the country in Virginia. if only we had more role models like you in
            office.



            For truth, life and hope,
