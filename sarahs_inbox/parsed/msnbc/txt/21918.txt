                FYI, I think the S Floor Session could be delayed b/c Lyda is not happy about the standard deductions and the in-
                state only purchase of materials (or something like that ). You probably already knew that...

                 FYI. We were expecting this sooner or later . All questions from media should be referred to the litigating attorney,
                 Mr. Givens , who is handling the Terry Clark case.

                It's unbelievable, but within minutes of being told of the lawsuit by our attorney ' s, the Anchorage Daily
                News was on the phone to me . Wow, wonder how they knew so fast? That's a rhetorical question by
                the way. Kristan

                As the representative for the shareholder (I know the Deputy Commissioner is out of town), I wanted to
                make you aware Mr. Ginder received a summons and complaint today from Mr. Van Treeck's attorney.
                He is contacting Mr. Givens our litigating attorney so he can respond.

                Also just an FYI in case the media were to contact you about this, please refer them to the Creamery
                Boards litigating attorney Jon Givens at 276-1711.
                Mr. Givens has instructed us before to not discuss any litigation and refer inquiries to him. Kristan

                Jon, I understand Pete received a summons and complaint from Mr. Van Treeck's attorney today. I
                assume you will have your office respond if necessary while you are on vacation. Also, Donna Edwards
                our controller is on vacation. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                I have copied Donna, Joe Austerman and Pete in on this email in case we need to do this while you are
                away. Not sure who notified them in the Terry Clark matter. Kristan
