          MESSAGE:

          Gov. Palin, I urge you to keep the Legislature in Special Session until they reach an
          agreement on the resource rebate. It is frustrating beyond words to see Lyda Green use
          her power and lack of concern about re-election to force her plan upon the House. There
          is no reasoning with her and it appears most of her decisions are now based on spite.




          Thank you for the awesome job you've been doing, and please continue to lobby for the
          average Alaskan by making the Legislature do their job before winter comes . God bless you
          and your family.



          Appreciatively,



          Jennifer Hall
