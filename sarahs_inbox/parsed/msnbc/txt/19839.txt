                  Thank you, Secretary Leavitt, & welcome! I am happy to accept this award on behalf of the
                  State of AK. I want to welcome also Region 10 HHS Director James Whitfield, & extend my
                  heartfelt thanks to Comm. Hogan & Ann Potempa with the Dpt. of Health & Social Services
                  - thanks so much for your hard work promoting this worthy program in our great state! Dr.
                  Butler, thank you for being here, for working to promote healthy lifestyles in AK, & for
                  practicing what you preach! I am SO proud of AKns for stepping up in such a big way
                  during this Nat'l fitness challenge . The Challenge kicked off on March 20 , & we got off to a
                  running start with more than 2,800 AKns signing up & adding at least 30 minutes of
                  running, biking, walking & dozens of other activities to their day.

                  And we received strong support from inside the state system, too. The Dpt of Health &
                  Social Services challenged our other depts to participate, resulting in hundreds of our state
                  employees engaging in a little healthy competition (no pun intended)@ - & with life-
                  changing results.

                  We are privileged to live in such a beautiful state, & AK offers endless opportunities to be

                 active, both indoors & out. Our people being our most precious commodity, it is
                 important that AKns not only live LONG in the land, but that they live WELL in the land.
                 Starting out adding just that little bit of activity to each day - just 30 min. - is so important to
                 our overall physical, mental & emotional health & wellness. And when combined with a
                 balanced diet, this can help lower the risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, &
                 numerous other health problems.

                 AK's 1st-place finish shows that we are definitely moving in the right direction - in a
                 healthier direction - & that's GREAT news for the future of AK! My thanks again to Sec.
                 Leavitt for the presentation of this award; please give the President our best & thank him for
                 promoting healthy lifestyles in America; & again, congratulations to all the AKns who
                 participated in the program! Your longevity & healthy lifestyle truly is the best reward.
                 Thank you!
