Hi Erika,




                                                       1                 ROSTON 01312

With the Governor returning to Juneau on Friday, just a reminder that unless there is an event taking
place all staff, plumbers, general services maintenance personnel, etc., need to leave the House by
4:30 each day. Any other exception that requires you or staff to be there past 4:30 needs to be
approved by me or Mike Nizich.




Thanks



Linda
