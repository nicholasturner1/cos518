          Governor,  I couldn't say this to all but when we get a chance to review more of the
          findings with you, we will show a path forward where all can win. I appreciate and agree
          with your feelings about Hickel and various options. It's in the PLAN :) God bless. Tom

          If I finish up something here I'm re-writing in short order I'll be able to get over to
          Cpt Ck before you leave- don't wait for me but I'll pop in if I hustle. (I'm still in
          Wasilla).



          Hickel is our friend, I know you know that... I want him to understand we only have AK's
          best interest in mind. I wish I could wave a magic wand and allow for an AK line to be
          built. If he can be made to understand our position would he attend our presser on AGIA
          next week? It may take a miracle to get him there and get him understanding that AGIA
          isn't a mistake - but it would be huge if he could show support after we reassure him that
          the door isn't closed to a bullet line, to exporting overseas, etc... all this within AGIA
          even.

          We are meeting Hickel and Malcolm at 8:00 this morning and we're planning on listening to
          them about the trip. We will continue to tell them our process but we won't give them any
          idea where we are going since our decision can't be.made until all the documents are
          complete.  You would be more than welcome especially with the KTUU flap (but not
          absolutely necessary depending on your schedule) and I know they would appreciate your
          interest in them and their trip. When asked today you could say that you had already seen
          Hickel.



           Marty and I were going to meet near Fletchers in the Captain Cook.



           We are going to meet with them again right before the announcement and discuss our AGIA
          conclusions.  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


           If you are going let us know and we will give Hickel a heads up. Also would you want us
          to meet you at the Cook or the Atwood building? Tom

           Hickel (according to ktuu) is basically saying it's just a huge mistake and China's
          markets are the wave of the future. Should I attend that mtg with hickel?

            Governor, we hadn't heard of any request in our area to make comments about Gov Hickel's
           complaint and didn't hear the news. Non stop AGIA reading.     However,  as part of
           continuing outreach to Hickel, Marty and I met with Hickel and Malcolm just before their
           trip to China.  At that time we asked if they would share what they learned when they got
           back.  They agreed and Marty and I are scheduled to meet with them early tomorrow
           morning.  We will share with you what ever we learn as soon as possible.



             Can anyone give a few word summary of the complaint so we know ahead of time? Thanks
           Tom

             It was reported tonight on ktuu that I wasn't available for the interview they requested
           today. I.did not know they had requested any interview to answer Hickel's complaint about
           AGIA. If I wasn't available then perhaps an AGIA person should have complied with their
           request. No doubt I'll be asked by them tomorrow to comment anyway - so I'd rather have
           spoken to them today so we didn't have that "no comment" response.



             Also, Kris: are Joey and/or Kristan and/or DNR folks familiar with MatMaid going to
           respond to Samuels' and other leggies' audit findings of today?
