               Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event information for today's bill signing and proclamation (September is Energy
              Efficiency Month). Worth noting is the pronunciation of the homeowner's name whose house we will be signing in
              front of Mrs. Carol Geczy is pronounced "Gate-SEE." Also, Kelly has invited Sen. Bill Weilechowski and Rep.
              Max Gruenberg to attend, as the home is within their district They are trying to rework their schedules and will
              attend if possible. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns . Thanks so much!
