               Mike, I received your update newsletter yesterday and am disappointed that the
               appropriation for upgrades to the safety and functionality of this road was vetoed by
               Gov. Palin. I will try to further the issue with her office and see if something can't be
               done to correct the dangerous deficiencies present on this road.

               I have been working with two of our Assemblypersons, Chris and Sheila, to keep this
               problem in the spotlight (see forwarded message trail) and I will be attending the LRSA
               board meeting on the 9th (next Monday evening). Hopefully we can get this corrected
               before we see an accident involving a runner or a bicyclist.

               Thanks for all your efforts.


               Ted
