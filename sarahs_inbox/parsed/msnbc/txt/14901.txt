           Trig is absolutely beautiful.  I was very blessed to read the articles regarding his
           birth, and you positive statements. I also thought it was pretty cool that you delivered
           at the hospital in Wassila because our close friend is a pastor at the Assemblies of God
           church there.  Anyway, I also have a son with Down syndrome. His name is Keaton, he is 8
           years old and he is the light of our lives and has molded who we are individually. He has
           3 big sisters age 23, 22, and 20. Our son is fully included in a general education 1st
           grade class and doing very well there. We were encouraged to treat him just like we did
           our other kids. Not to treat him "special", but to expect much of him and allow him to
           show us what he can do. We have lived that way for 8 years and he never ceases to amaze
           us.  I would love to send you pictures of him playing soccer, singing the National Anthem
           (which is his favorite), and receiving the "Terrific Kid" award at his school.

           God bless you!
