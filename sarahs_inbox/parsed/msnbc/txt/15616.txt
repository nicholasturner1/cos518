           Message :I again request that you and your staff consider the concept of forward funding
           for the state budget. You've seen the bumper sticker, promising not to (waste) the next
           pipeline windfall; do not forego the chance to get the state on solid financial footing
           with the current surprise windfall.



           Thank you,
