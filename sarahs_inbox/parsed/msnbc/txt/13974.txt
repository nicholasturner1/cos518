            Governor - Senator Huggins office just called and would like to have the 1:00 p.m. meeting
            today.  We had taken it off due to being to late in the afternoon. They stated that if
            the 1:00 p.m. time slot did not work that they would then cancel all together. They have
            no other openings as they will be on the floor. Janice

            Today's schedule is going to be packed again, without much room for budget. Janice and
            Mike- pls let people know I can NOT spend much time in these other meetings away from the
            budget- remember I fly out tomm night and I'll be making the budget decisions today. We
            need to make the rounds asap with lawmakers to communicate the pending vetoes, I'd think
            Russ will have to tap into others to help him cover everyone today and tomorrow.
