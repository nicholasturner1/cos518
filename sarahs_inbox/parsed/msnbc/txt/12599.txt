             Your name was mentioned on Rush. I looked you up on your website. I hope if asked you will
             accept John McCains invitation if offered to join his ticket. You are what the party needs
             to stop Obama. Obama has to be stop or this is the ruination of this-country. Thank You,
             Arnold Nass
