               I've heard that Lew Williams Jr., former publisher of the Ketchikan Daily News , Wrangell and
               Petersburg newspapers , former Wrangell and Petersburg mayor, and son of former Alaska
               Secretary of State Lew Williams , died this weekend . He was also a University of Alaska regent,
               served on many state boards and commissions over the years , and was active in everything
               Alaska (a contemporary of the late Anchorage Times publisher Bob Atwood and the late Fairbanks
               Daily News-Miner publisher C.W. Snedden). He had been writing a column for the Voice of the
               Times for years.

               I have not seen confirmation of his death in the news, but I've heard it from two people close to the
               family. i expect it will make the news later today.
