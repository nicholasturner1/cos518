              Sandy and I went to two ceremonies on Ft Rich and I read portions of your proclamation.
              Jay is on his way to Palmer Pioneer Home and will read the same portions of your
              proclamation on your behalf. At some point about 300 warriors return to Elmendorf (within
              next three hours). Sandy and I plan to meet them. Hope your day is well--we remember you,
              Todd, Trak and family. Thanks for your guys' personal investment of your lives and that of
              your son.
