           MESSAGE:

           I just came across an article in today's email that mention that John McCain may consider
           you for his VP. After extensively reading information from your site and relating news
           articles, I wanted to write to say that I would be very excited to see you accept that
           offer if it comes your way. You are what America needs and have much to give to the
           Republican Party. We need "new blood" and "change we can believe in" and I feel confident
           you can provide both.




           Good luck in all future endeavors, whatever they may be.
