         Also, there are a couple of events the week of the 11th. The Arctic Parliamentary, etc.
         Janice will be giving those to you tomorrow. Also, just an FYI, I'll be up in Fairbanks
         for state cup soccer that week (the 11th).

         Since I'll be in Nenana on Friday for the bridge ceremonial bill signing, I can get up
         there the day before to meet with Mayor Whittaker on his energy issues.

            Possibility in getting out there to meet with Bernie (at Chena) to hear his geothermal
         ideas too, during this Fairbanks visit.

            Remember part of the purpose for the Nenana event is to honor AK Native women w/naming
        .the bridge... so besides Britta and Kelly staffing me for that (and Joe needs to get to
         Fairbanks so we can talk energy, too), I would think Rhonda and/or Tara Jollie would want
         to participate? And if Kris wants to staff up there, then great... If not, that's cool
         too.
