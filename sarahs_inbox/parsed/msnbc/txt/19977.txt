               Subject : NGA/Resource Committee Priorities

               Russ and I spoke today with representatives of Governor Schweizer, = vice chair of the Natural
               Resources Committee, and NGA staff concerning themes and priorities for the committee.

               Subject to each of us obtaining guidance from our respective = governors, we tentatively
               identified energy infrastructure as our major = theme. In turn, this issue would be divided into
               the following components:

                      · Natural gas and oil pipelines
                      · Transmission lines
                         National electricity grid, including smart meters and storage
                      · Funding of infrastructure, including public-private partnerships
                         This theme extrapolates from the NGA chair's emphasis on infrastructur= e generally. In
                         addition, Russ and I figured that it would be a good = way to marshal additional bipartisan
                         support for an Alaska gas pipeline to = the lower 48.

                         Before proceeding further, it would be helpful for us to know whether = the foregoing
                         makes sense to you. Thanks.
