              Hi, Kris...



              Sorry if I've been incommunicado.           I've been working a graveyard shift

              --   11:00pm to 8:30am ... filling in for Sheila Balistreri. She had a

              death in her family and is down in the Lower 48. Appreciate you and

              your staff giving me some space.


                                                                      2

              I've had all kinds of a-mails and phone calls from people offering me

              their good wishes .      All of them seem so excited about this opportunity

              to work with the Paliln administration.



              I didn't get to hear Governor Palin' s speech announcing that she was

              bringing me on board, but folks said it was so gracious, that she

              really did a nice job of introducing me.          Please convey my heartfelt

              thanks.



              In my current state of sleep deprivation,         I sometimes wonder if it's a

              dream .... and I'll wake up and John Tracy will be assigning me stories

              through January.



              I have had a few calls from folks in the administration ,             thinking I

              was going to start right away.          I hope they'll be patient.



              Just to confirm,      I plan on coming to work on Monday, December 10th.

              Perhaps the week before, I might be able to bring some boxes of stuff

              in...and get semi -organized.



              I hear you    carry a heavy load, when it comes to shouldering the work.



              I don't want to add to your burden ...        but at this point, who should I

              direct my questions to about all the details ... like where do you park?

              cell phone use?



             Thanks,



             Rhonda
