 Todd,

 This week I need to take Thursday, March 6 and Friday, March 7 off for         ^2-cdat to            Jn
 Seattle. Next week I'll be gone from Tuesday, March 11th through Monday, March 17th for Kectati,") I in
 Seattle. I might not need to take all of the requested dates, so I'll keep you posted in case things
 change. I will have my Blackberry with me, so if you need to get a hold of me it won't be a problem.

 Thanks,
