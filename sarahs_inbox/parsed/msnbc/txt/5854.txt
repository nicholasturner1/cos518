           Hello Governor,

           Mayor Shirley Marquardt of Unalaska dropped off 8 pounds of King Crab at the House 3/29. Its in the freezer
           downstairs, and Stefani will use it for a family meal or a lunch or dinner event..., unless you have something else
           you'd like to use it for.

           Thanks,
           Erika
