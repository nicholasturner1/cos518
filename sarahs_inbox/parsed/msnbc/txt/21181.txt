         They may need a new purchase of tickets be these fits are all messed up with weather. And
         i cant stay another night here or in MN, which sounds like the only other option. Pls let
         linda perez know - i cant miss my packed day of mtgs tomorrow inlc sen.Stevens and trip to
         fairbanks.

         Your connection will be 30 minutes - enough time to make flight .                   If you change , not arrive
         til 2 am
