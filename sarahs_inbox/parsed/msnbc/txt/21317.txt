               Did he say it publicly, on record? Hopefully media picks up so Alaskans know of Kelly's

                Mike is right on tonight . He said he doesn't want the ghost of pedro and daniel hanging
               around all special session so they should specifically say what they don't like about your
               hybrid plan . Daniel didn ' t answer and pedro said it's not a real hybrid plan - not very
               convincing . Mike said , I think we have a trust issue here ...or words to that effect. I
               love it!
