             Just someone pls find the coordinator - I approached Privileged or about the position, he
             doesn 't want it. And I will tell Tibbles I do not know why the change in plans, but it's
             nonsense.



             In the meantime , pls find a coordinator. I don't know many folks in the business and would
             be perceived as having a conflict if I asked my father in law for input on this.

            I agree , you should not be saddled with a soap opera . You should be briefed on the
            recommended choice after your team has reached consensus .  I actually thought that already
            occurred and we were awaiting your decision.



             If the board has initiated some other course , that is news to me, and , it would seem,
            unnecessary and inefficient . I an copying Frank , hopefully he has more Intel.

              I don't understand.  I thought everybody was on board with           (all 3 commissioners,
             Frank, Marty, me, Mike Black ). Does this need to be so comp icate      Why would the board
             proceed in this inefficient way without consulting with the workgroup?

                The AIDEA/AEA board voted to hire a search firm .          They put out a quick

                RFP.    The contract should be signed this week and names should come in

                soon.
