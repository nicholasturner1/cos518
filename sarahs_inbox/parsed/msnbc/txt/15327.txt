          Governor, an individual I have known for several years came up to me and asked if.I would
          give you a message.   He is so appreciate of you wanting to help Alaskans. He knows many
          people who are really hurting and it gives hope when someone cares for them and is looking
          out for them. Thank you! God bless. Tom
