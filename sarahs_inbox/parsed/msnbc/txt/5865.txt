            My understanding is that once the whaling season begins , residents are not around to host a
            town hall meeting . Certainly, it is an honor to be invited . Perhaps a town hall meeting
            during the week of the 16th and then ask to be there the following year for the opening of
            the whaling season . Additionally, I have been told that search and rescue has been called in
            more often than most can remember because the ice is breaking up differently than in the
            past and is stranding whalers who are setting up camp right now.

            The Governor has been invited by Mayor Itta to see the Whaling event firsthand between April 23 and
            May 6. Would that be a better time to go?

            Governor,

            Before I begin looking at your schedule , do you want to try and get to Barrow In the next
            two weeks - before whaling season begins ? Or shall I just try to send Tom Irwin?

            Please provide guidance.

            Thanks,
            Meghan
