MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin: I just want to send my warmest congratulations to you and your family on the
birth of your son. As the mother of a son with Down syndrome, I just want to share your joy as you
welcome your son to your family. As you already know, you truly are blessed and I hope that your
son has good health and your family much love. On a personal note, I also applaud you for your
ability to balance the joys of motherhood with the triumphants of a profession, espcially one of such
grand public service. It is not often we see a woman so able to "do it all" and I think you are an
inspiration to women everywhere. Good luck in all your endeavors & God Bless.



Best Regards,

Rebecca Daugintis

Massillon, Ohio
