What was Harris thinking?!?! How inappropriate! It's a shame some think that we still don't need to
work hard for Alaska and for Alaskans to trust us. The economy and resource development are
important too, but upholding the highest ethical standards in state government is just as substantive
an issue.

Kelly said the governor expects ethics-in-government reform to resurface this year as there's a need
to continue to restore Alaskans' faith in their government.

" It seems silly to try and pretend as if it doesn 't have a huge affect on how we do business as a state.
To think that we aren 't going to do something about it legislatively is probably not realistic ," Kelly said.

Harris said the sweeping ethics reforms achieved this session were enough, and that more could
discourage people from becoming lawmakers.

"What more is there to address that wasn't addressed already?" Harris said. "I don't know what the
hell they've been smoking if they want to do more ethics reform. I want to get down to some
substantive issues to deal with the economy."
