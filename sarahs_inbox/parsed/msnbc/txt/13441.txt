             Dear Governor Palin,

             Hi, I am Suzie Smith, the state president of the Utah Down Syndrome Foundation.

             I was just sent an email stating that you had recently given birth to son with Down
             syndrome. First, I would like to say congratulations on the birth of your child. Second, I
             would like to offer you one of our Utah Down Syndrome Foundation Newborn Booklets. I don't
             know if Alaska has a support group with a booklet like ours. I know I have sent our's as
             far as Japan.

             You can learn more about our organization at www.udsf.org. Please feel free to contact me
             at either mom24-7@comcast.net or suzie@udsf.org.

             We have a poster that states "A baby first..." Enjoy your new son he has just opened up a
             whole new world for you and your family!

             Sincerely,

             Suzie Smith
