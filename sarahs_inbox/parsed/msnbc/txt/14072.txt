             She submitted one for non exempt paybill and we have a back up plan in the house if the
             senate doesn 't follow thru.



             I know you talked to meyer a million times-very frustrating ! In our liaison mtg today russ
             and mindy didn ' t realize studded tires was scheduled - they were pleasently surprised. I'll
             send studded tire info to get this expedited.



             Kris , I    think biz license fee will get some traction in sen finance if emil will call
             stedman     directly and his liaison submits a formal hearing request-the liasion hasn't been
             getting     any traction so this is a good place for a cabinet member to step up . Could you
             talk to     emil about that? I think we can get this scheduled.

            I talked with Annette last night about something separate and she mentioned was submitting
            her new ones for DOA bills . This is step one in getting bills on the slate ...I've got to
            believe they know the requirement to submit the letter.



             It'll be interesting to see what they say.

            these.

            requesting.

             is when we realized that we didn ' t even have a hearing request for it.            Anything you all
             can get us would be good!

                    Suzanne,




                  Thanks for the email. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Rep Meyer-he's one
            of my favorites. I wouldn't reference his name without first talking to him about it.




                   Would Rep Meyer hear HB 106 if he received a hearing request?

                   Ivy,




                  Thanks for the phone call yesterday . We appreciate it. The funny thing is, I went
            back and looked at hearing requests that I have received , and we haven ' t even received a
            hearing request from the administration for HB 106.
