           I'll be there!      Thanks!



           Janice- let's reserve Sept 21 for Kurt's grand opening. And let's do a congratulations
           letter to him for opening this business and helping to revitalize Anchorage.

          Gov. Sarah,




          If you are interested in a tasty Johnsonville Stadium Bratwurst, Chedder Cheesedog or an
          outstanding F'real Milkshake we are planning the Grand Opening for Friday, September 21st.
            I have prepaid for a "Post it" ad in the ADN and that is about the only Friday available
          in the foreseeable forever. Fridays are good days for us and Coca Cola will provide a
          BBQ.  I need to have it before snow flies.



          Later, Kurt




                                                                 1
