        Right on! Don't you miss Kerm and the crew? I do. Frank can think of some names, and IN
        HER SPARE time Kris can think about this and maybe delegate to Frank the task of inviting
        the crew - maybe he still has contact info for the war room group of workerbees that got
        us here. Thanks!



        If after the Miner's game is too late, how about before it? (Now I'm really inviting
        myself.)

        I think he would say, "the more the merrier." I'll send him the info.

        Fun.

        Ivy:     hate to invite my own ideas on to someone else - but here's any

        idea: what if Don invited some of our crew to his bbq after the Miner's

        game - wouldn't it be great to get back together with Kerm and Glen and

        Bruce and other awesome workerbees that helped get us here? I can't

        find many available slots in this summer's sched to have a shin dig with

        our peeps - could we do it at Don's that evening?

        Hi guys!



        Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



        Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name ( s) to me for selection, then

        on to the legislature for confirmation.



        We need innovation in that seat. Both your names brought forward are

        great. Not sure why Ed Bd thinks it needs a nationwide search, which I

        heard recently. I'll ask Lynne Smith to check the status on that and ask

        what my input is worth in terms of their method of soliciting names.



        Thank you guys. You're awesome. Keep up the great work - I miss (six

        months later) our of rag-tag team of hardcore workerbees. Maybe the

        crew can get together for a shin dig soon? I know Kris and Todd miss

        the campaign folks too. Six months zipped by - I'd love for us all

        together . Don Benson , Mark Fish ,    Perdews, Mary , etc, all of usl
