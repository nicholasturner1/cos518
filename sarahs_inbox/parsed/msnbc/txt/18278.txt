          Dear Ms. Hodges:




          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

          State does not need to pay for Community items/projects. As far as Churches/camps;

          1. It is NOT specific to the color of the person.

          2. We sent our own children to camp, without financial assistance.

          3. Churches should turn to their own menbers for support.

          4. Communities, as you have said, have their own tax base.



          Sarah, can you have more of the Legislator meetings in Anchorage or Fairbanks? Until the
          Capitol is moved!!!!!



          THANK YOU, Governor Sarah Palin!!!!!!!!!!!
