           I met with Talis on further concerns about sub-cabinet idea. I'll have Talis call you re:
           our conversation. He and I are on the same page with concerns about promising any kind of
           big announcement at AFN this fall. Thanks

           Governor makes the final call of course. We recommend which we will be doing soon. The Gov
           has already asked me to make sure we include Gen Campbell and John Katz on the federal
           side should be included as well. Commissioner Bishop is a great resource in rural issues
           as well and should be considered a participant in this.

          I have more thoughts on what Talis has shared about how he 'd like the Rural Sub -Cabinet
          formed,  but  I am attending a Rural -Urban conference today -- so I will make a few
          points and follow- up with more later.

            If I may, to learn more -- raise a few questions and make a few points on the make-up of
            the Cabinet.



            Doesn't the Governor always make the final choice in selecting sub-cabinets?                We make
            suggestions.  She decides.

            Thanks to.all for their input and enthusiasm.



            I look forward to more discussion -- perhaps done over the telephone on Monday.

           I agree with Talis with the exception of the date June 5th, DPS will be graduating
           Troopers and police officers from the Sitka Academy that day, and I have been asked to be
           the keynote speaker.

           What are the email FOIA requests that have been received, besides the polar          bear issue
           that was requested quite some time ago, evidently?
