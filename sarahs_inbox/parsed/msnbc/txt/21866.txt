             Subject: Exxon Valdez /Amicus Brief




            A staffer in behalf of at least one member of the Alaska Congressional Delegation, and
            perhaps all three , asked whether it would be possible for the delegation to join in the
            state's amicus brief in the Exxon Valdez litigation .  We were non committal but promised
            to ask.




            Any guidance you can give us would be appreciated .              Thanks.
