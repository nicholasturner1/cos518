           MESSAGE:

           Recently I heard Governor Palin interviwed by Larry Kudlow on CNBC, and I think that she
           would make a first-rate running mate.for Senator John McCain. Please encourage her to
           accept if asked! What can we do to encourage Senator McCain to put her on the ticket?
           She is clearly a very winsome political leader. Congratulations to Alaska for choosing
           such a governor. Go Sarah!



           Sincerely,



           Fr. William Paul McKane
