                   Governor.

                   I just got off the phone with Meghan Stapleton. She is sending an addendum about the rural trips
                   that mentions those trips we know occurred that she has been able to confirm. Do you want to
                   see this before I send it on to Megan Holland? Or, as Meghan has suggested, can I send it in a
                   new seperate e-mail to Megan?

                  Thank you. Best if has mayor porter and manager koch with him. He MUST be candid, honest
                  and must ask to be held accountable because he has nothing to hide as he tells truthfully of the
                  situation... is my opinion based on what I've been told. I have no reason to NOT believe him
                  based on info I am aware of... now Alaskans need to hear clearly why he is to be believed. Solid
                  and strong and truthful. (I hope he realizes how bad some folks want to crucify us - he needs to
                  be strong. )

                  Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at public
                  safety.

                  It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a
                  memo from the City of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when the
                  allegation /complaint came into the department the city removed Chuck from all supervisory
                  duties. They made it quite sinister as you can expect like there is still something that he and the
                  city was hiding.

                   I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through
                  this with me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on the phone with the City
                  of Kenai attorney's office working on a strategy.

                 The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human
                 resource response when you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it
                 relates to sexual harassment, you remove immediately the person from the any of supervisory
                 duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this woman) until you can substantiate or
                 unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the claim and eventually
                 Chuck returned to normal duties.

                 Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he
                 can and set the record stra' ht. He will have the city Mayor by his side and she will attest to the
                 situation in favor of Chuck. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                        I

                  That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in
                  the morning with some more follow up.

                  My understanding , j ust based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going
                  to hold a press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman ? And the
                  kenal mayor will be standing with him? If there are any detailis I need to hear them - like when this
                  will take place, what prompted this new action, etc.
                    He does need to take all action , solidly, to dispel any untruths out there , asap. I've had very
                  good Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
