           MESSAGE:

           Dear Ms. Palin,




           Never having been much on the political watch, your endeavors have increasingly captured
           my attention over the years until recently, I'm pleasantly astounded! Your recent
           demonstration showing dedication to the State, commitment to family and God, and
           exceptional concern for humanity has brought me to my knees! Congratulations on your
           fifth successful childbirth!  I share with many Alaskans in awe, pride, call it whatever,
           but YOU GO GIRL! You're an awesome woman and we are proud to call you our Governor!
