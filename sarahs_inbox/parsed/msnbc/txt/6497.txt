       Governor -




       I have added all commissioner's to a distribution list in your Outlook account. So, if
       sending an email to the commissioners from your blackberry select Commissioner's from your
       contacts.




       If sending from your desk top computer from Gov Palin account you can use
       gov.commish@alaska.gov <mailto:gov.commish@alaska.gov>




       Please let me know if this does not work for you and I can walk you through it. Thanks,




                                                           1
