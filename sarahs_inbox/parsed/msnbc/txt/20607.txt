           Hi Bill- thanks for attending the luncheon today!

              Also, I spoke with Marion Ramano last night at the fair. Interesting that she decided
           to leave the borough and is now looking for a new challenge. I like her enthusiasm. She
           said she spoke to you and will be speaking with you again in the future about possible
           opportunities to serve the state. I told her I'd let you know that wespoke - we have a
           good relationship over 25-plus years.
