             I am checking flight right now. I am at the office and am calling the

             supervisor of the JNU Alaska Airlines counter. Janice

             Janice- if he doesn't make it in I'll need the morning to get kids

             registered in classes and line up rides after school. Is the AP editor a

             firm committment at loam? Maybe she can't make it in either.

              Weather's horrible. Would someone check on Todd's flt's chances tonight

              so he doesn't drive into Anchorage and have to turn around again? Pls

              cc all w/reply so there's no duplication of effort. Thanks
