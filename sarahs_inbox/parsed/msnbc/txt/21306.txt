              Ugh. My beef was considering all the good women running this state - including YOU!!!   I
              ran it by Bristol- she says he wouldn't have even used the term whore if he was talking
              about men.

              I know what I'll be working on tonight--thanks for the head's up.



             As an Alaskan, I don't need Fagan weighing in on how you are governing

             the state--we (Alaskans) can see for our selves the great job you're

             doing.

             Fagan's going off the deep end with his intimation (that we're "whores")

             in yesterday's rant. I didn't believe what people told me he said until

             I heard it myself.



             It was almost   "good" to hear it though - it allowed me to put a nail in
                                                                  1

             I heard the "...bunch of crack whores running to the sugar daddy"

             comment from Fagan this morning.

             Unbelievable.



             What's the difference between what he just called the State's team and

             what Don Imus called the basketball team when HE said the women were

             "nappy-headed ho's".



             Fagan was talking about resources and budget spending - and calling

             those in leadership "whores". That' s me, Kris , Karen Rehfeld, Marty

             Rutherford, Sharon, Annette, Karleen, Tara... etc.



             He is sick and should not get away with this one.



             This one is unbelievable.
