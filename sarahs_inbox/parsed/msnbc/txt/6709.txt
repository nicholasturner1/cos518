        It's the Charter guys. They are not happy and seem to have the ear of the

        secretary's office.

        Tib - what front group would be threatening litigation over our NPFMC

        nominees?

         I am writing to request that your respective principals communicate = their

        support to the Secretary of Commerce for Governor Palin's nominations= to

        the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council.




        The Secretary is receiving pressure from recreational groups = which are

        insisting that one of the Governor ' s appointments have a = specific

        recreational perspective .        Apparently ,    they are now = threatening litigation

        if this does not occur.



        We have previously apprised the Secretary of the rationale for the =

        Governor ' s nominations .      In addition , we have enlisted the support of =

        various Alaska fishing groups ,        some of which have already sent letters.&nbs=

        p%



        I don't think that the Secretary will disapprove either of = the Governor's

        appointments .     There is no precedent for this, and one = or more members of

        the NPFMC have a recreational perspective.




        Further, we doubt that litigation would be successful. = However ,                   federal

        officials sometimes become risk averse when litigation = is threatened.



        In these circumstances ,      strong expressions of support for the = Governor's

        nominees could go a long way in averting unnecessary conflict                  = between the

        State and the Department of Commerce.



        Thanks for considering this request .            If we can provide any = further

        information , please let me know.




        Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is

                                                                 2
