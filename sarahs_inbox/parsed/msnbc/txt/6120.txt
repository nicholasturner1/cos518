         MESSAGE:

         We all knew what a lousy job Murkowski did as governor.



         But one thing that he did do --- is that he actually responded to e-mails and did not
         justs end out one automated message after another.



         We (every single hockey player in Anchorage) would like an answer.



         Why did the Governor ask for our vote; indicating to us that she supported hockey?



         ***Thank you for NOTHING Palin***



         You've let everyone in the hockey community DOWN.



         SHAME ON YOU.


                                                                 1
