              MESSAGE:

              I just wanted to reach out and say hello to a fellow mom. My Jacob was born Feb 6, 2008,
              and he too is "chomosomally enhanced", as we say at our house. I grew up never having met
              one of the angels on earth (aka someone with Down Syndrome) and was frightened and
              depressed when I learned the diagnosis in my 4th month of pregnancy. I sincerely hope
              that stories like yours will get more press in the coming years, so the general public
              will come to understand that our children have drive and potential, just like any other
              child.  I want to shout to everyone who gives me that worried, sympathetic look that my
              baby is a blessing, not a burden, and he always will be. Thank you for being open about
              your family and your choices. God bless you.
