           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin,

           I respect your brave and honorable decision to allow Trig to be born. My wife and I faced
           a similar situation 15 years ago when prenatal genetic testing determined our daughter,
           Faith, would have Down Syndrome.  She has brought untold joy into our lives, and now out
           other daughter, 24, works at Johns Hopkins Hospital with people with developmntal
           disabilities.  My wife volunteers at Capernaum Ministries, a Christian organization
           devoted to bringing happiness to children with disabilities. In other words, Trig will
           change your life for the better. May God bless your decision to do the right thing.

           Sincerely,

           Steve Pasko
