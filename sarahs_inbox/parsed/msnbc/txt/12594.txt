            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I'm writing this to find out how I can support you in a bid for the Vice Presidency with
            the Republican Party.  Since hearing about you on Rush Limbaugh today, I've done a lot of
            research on your political views and feel you would make the ticket strong. The fact that
            over 80% of Alaska supports you after two years, speaks very well of you.



            How can I help you get on the ticket?



            Sincerely,



            Joe Fournier

            Pensacola, FL
