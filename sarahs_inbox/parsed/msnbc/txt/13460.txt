            DEAR GOV. PALIN: CONGRATS ON THE BIRTH OF YOUR FIFTH CHILD, AND YOUR EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR
            HIS FIRST NAME. I HAVE MET VERY FEW PEOPLE WITH THE FIRST NAME OF TRIG, IT IS VERY
            SPECIAL. I WAS BORN ON 11/7/1951 IN LAWRENCE KS, AND WAS NAMED ALF TRIGVA HAUFF OLESON II
            AFTER MY FATHER. I HAVE ALWAYS GONE BY TRIG, AND EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS CALLED ME TRIGGER. I
            KNOW YOU ARE VERY BUSY, BUT I HOPE THIS E-MAIL PUTS A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. BEST OF LUCK TO
            YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, AND IF YOU EVER COME THROUGH EUDORA KS, STOP BY AND LET ME MEET TRIG.
            HAVE A GREAT DAY. TRIG OLESON 504 E 7TH ST EUDORA KS 66025 785-542-3350
