            Thank you for the information. I'll contact them and we'll schedule a tour for the Junior
            Girl Scout Troop for one of those days.

           MESSAGE:

           Our Junior Girl Scout Troop is planning a trip to Juneau in March from Ketchikan. We will
           be there Monday , March 17 and Tuesday, March 18, 2008 .  They are very interested in
           touring the capital building and the Governor ' s mansion if that is a possibility as well
           as meeting some of our government officials .   I could not find anywhere that had
           information about how we contact someone to arrange this. Could you please have someone
           contact me?
