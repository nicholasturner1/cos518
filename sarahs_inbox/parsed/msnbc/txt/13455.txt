            MESSAGE:

            I saw a piece that Glenn Back did about your family last night on TV. 20 years ago my
            husband and I welcomed our sweet Brian into our lives. He too has Downs and yes, you ARE
            truly blessed.  There has not been one day that has gone by that I haven't been truly
            grateful and humbled by the gift God has given us.



            It brought tears to my eyes to hear your press release and I wish much peace and happiness
            for your family!



            God Bless!
