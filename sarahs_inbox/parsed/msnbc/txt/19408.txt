            Is unscripted, although interactive so there may be questions - general             in nature and
            there will be oppotunity to weigh in on some polling (anonymously). The             seating.is as I
            explained, but Susan said Governor's can come and go as necessary. Both             centennial
            sessions are recorded by CSPAN. The Gov's lunch tomorrow is for you and             any family, no
            staff and security. Clinton will be at lunch.
