              Subject: Phone call with Sen. Lisa Murkowski

            Good morning! I spoke with Lisa today (Murkowski, not Parker :)) and learned an interesting piece of information I
            didn't know...

            Apparently, the Sierra Club (?) recently filed a petition under the ESA requesting that Lynn Canal herring be listed
            as endangered-they spawn in Berner's Bay . According to Lisa , this could be a shot at Kensington Mine or the
            Juneau Access Road (or both). The question is whether there really is a threat to the herring run (science) or is it
            a ploy to stop development.

            Just thought you'd like to know if you hadn't heard at this.
