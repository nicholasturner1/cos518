                 Governor,

                 Great job today. I wanted to forward an email I received about your early learning speach.

                 Unfortunately I missed most of the 5:00 pm news regarding the savings plan. I did catch the last 10 seconds
                 where Bill stated Rep. Meyer was concerned about the PFD deposit and the potential impact to the dividend. We
                 left $2 Billion in the earnings reserve so there would be more than enough cushion to pay next yea's dividend.

                 I look forward to the 6:00 pm news.

                 Mike

                 Hi, Mike. I wanted to drop you a note after attending today's lunch at the Governor's Summit on
                 Early Learning. The Governor was outstanding. She commanded the room, gave one of her finest
                 speeches and seemed extremely comfortable and confident with the subject matter. Certainly you
                 hear plenty of compliments and deservedly so, but I was particularly struck by the Governor's
                 comments today and wanted to pass my thoughts on to you.

                Dear Governor Palin,
                      Nice speech at the education summit Your brother introduced himself to me. He was very nice in his comments.
                      For all it is worth, Speaker Harris called me on an environmental case and the Dyson letter. In the course of the
                conversation he said he was not too thrilled about your plan announced today to make the deposit to the PFD. That was not
                the focus of his conversation. However, I thought it might be of interest to you in your consideration of the steps you might
                take to follow through with your plan. Talis
