            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov. Palin, Todd, and Palin family,

            I just wanted to let you know that we think you're wonderful! God bless you for your
            strength and your wonderful outlook on life. Congratulations on your newest family
            member.  I love the part of the ADN story that tells of your email to close family and
            friends, signed by "Trig's Creator, your Heavenly Father." what a wonderful perspective.
            May God richly bless you all!

            With blessings and prayers,

            Francie Martin

             (I'm a 47 year old mother of six.... yes, children are a blessing!)
