             Importance: High

           The Governor is agreeable to a bill signing with the finance co-chairs today, but out in the sun! I told her we don't'
           have Andy and Jason so she wonders if we could get Channel 2 news or someone? Please advise!

           Good morning, y'all.

           I always like to make my favorite OMB director happy.

           One way to do that is to have my favorite Governor sign SB 82, the Governor's must-have, time-sensitive oil and
           gas supplemental bill, as soon as possible.

           Shannon is poised to run the bill down to the Governor at the drop of a hat.

          We don't need trumpets, whoopla, and whatnot to mark the occasion. A simple bill-signing in her office will do,
          followed by a press release.

          For good measure, I suppose we could ask the finance co-chairs to be there. I defer to greater minds than mine to
          address this.

          Karl: how does the Governor's schedule look today for a bill- signing?
          Chris
