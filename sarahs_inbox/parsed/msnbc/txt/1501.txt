   Todd,
   You did not travel to Juneau the month of November 2007. Please let me know if you need me to check on anything else.
   Thanks,

  Erika,

  Jay Ramars is spreading rumors that last fall during the special session for oil taxes (ACES) I was walking the halls of the
  capitol with Sarah pushing for new oil taxes.

  Please check my travel for that November month, I think I was never in Juneau during that time.

  Thanks Todd

  Todd,
   Linda thought it was a great idea to have Karen Newton and Connie Stewart at the tea due to the vital role that they played in
  the House's history. The state can pay their expenses and they also have Governor's office miles.
