              we made significant progress toward our ultimate goals of repealing
              Tier IV,. Military buy-back; and Presumptive Liability. Rest assured
              that these fights are far from over - we will continue the pressure
              until we prevail. We have scheduled a PR planning meeting for May 22nd
              during which we will frame our long-term PR and political strategy for
              better funding, work conditions and compensation packages statewide.
              There is a real disconnect between the Governor and public safety and
              I believe that she doesn ' t know that she doesn ' t know - I think it is
              called unconsciously incompetent . As we partner with AFSCME personnel
              and resources and create structure and consistency to our approach I
              encourage all to be ready and willing to. participate as much as
              possible. It is up to our collective body to insure that our agenda is
              heard, acknowledged, and properly addressed. Naturally, we will be
              carefully examining Federal, State, and Local political candidates and
              their positions on our issues. We will also be visiting regularly with
              these politicians between now and the 2009 session. As we provide
              updates on our findings and assessments please be unafraid to let your
              voices be-heard.   Rob Cox, President of PSEA

              It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the
              DPS budget and contract results... especially in light of how hard you
              all worked to increase funds and provide tools that DPS claimed they
              needed to do their job. Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have
              been overlooked by some.
                There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union",
              and this is unfair to you, to the whole administration, and most
              importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth. Please share
              your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on your
              work product and our committment to public safety can be countered
              with the truth. Thank you
