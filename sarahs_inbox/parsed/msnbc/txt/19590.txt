          Proof that today's PSEA/Wooten presser had nothing to do with Walt's dismissal: on Sunday,
          Wooten refused to follow court order to hand the kids over to Molly after his visitation.
          One of Wooten's sergeants had to call him and tell him he must obey the court order. He
          handed over the kids and promised Molly, "Get ready for a show. I'm going to bring you and
          your family down". From there he riled up the union and then had the press conf. I just
          found this out tonight.

          As confirmed in Molly's attorney file (Bobby Irwin), there have been NO complaints filed
          by the Heath or Palin family. Jason Moore stated we filed 15 complaints and only three
          were substantiated. KTVA claimed we filed 36 complaints! And John Cyr stumbled on that
          question with dead silence when he was asked about it... There have been no formal
          complaints.

             If Walt tries to go there, my response is "nice try", he can try to deflect from the
          reasons he was let go by blaming it on the Wooten issue, but he knows it's not true and
          perhaps he doesn't want a public discussion about his administrative skills being made
          public.
