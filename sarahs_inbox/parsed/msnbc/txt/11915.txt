             Why the change in recruitment plans tho? And was it concluded by commissioners or board
             members that Privile had an actual conflict, thus he couldnbt take the job? I'm cc-ing in
             everyone so you guys can work on this together, then someone pls contact me with the
             recommendation of who the coordinator shall be.



             I don't know as many people in the energy biz as our commissioners do. I'm asking them for
             reco's rather than going through a bureaucratic system of recruitment.

             The AIDEA/AEA board voted to hire a search firm. They put out a quick

             RFP.     The contract should be signed this week and names should come in

             soon..
