Janice,



You'll have to ask her when she returns to Juneau. Please remind her that it's about a 20 mile ride in
the sled to Cambell Airstrip.

Todd - I remember this request coming in awhile back and you were going to check with the
Governor to see if she was interested in doing this? March 1 - Iditarod start (Just a note: the
Governor needs to be in Los Angeles on that Monday, March 3 ). She would be riding Sled 2 from
4th Avenue to Campbell Airstrip . Thanks , Janice

The other option is an Iditarider which rides in the sled but is chosen by the highest bidder.all

proceeds go to Iditarod Please let us know ASAP and we can get into specifics or I can choose

some one other than yourself if you are unable. Lance
