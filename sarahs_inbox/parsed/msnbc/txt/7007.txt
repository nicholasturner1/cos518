           Should I tell her no? Or should she meet with Joe Balash?

           Hi Karl, I know that you and Tuckerman are playing phone tag. I'll try to wrap things up with this
           email. Tuckerman and I would like to see Governor Palin as early as possible to discuss the Railbelt
           Energy Fund. I'm currently in Juneau, and Tuckerman will schedule his flight according to the
           Governor's schedule. My cell number is 841-7212.

           Thanks,
           Lorali Carter
           MEA Manager of Government and Corporate Communications
