               <<YOUR PRESENCE IS REQUESTED docxmas 2007.doc>>

              Hi Sarah,

              I know you are busy, but ............... wanted to forward on an invitation sent to the
              commissioners office.  We would enjoy a visit from you, and I am sure the staff would
              appreciate a quick visit as well- as Ag has had a lot of negative publicity of late, and
              nothing like the smiling face of the Governor to lift everyone's spirits! :) If you can
              spare a few minutes a visit to the main office would be greatly appreciated as well.

              Thanks for the Christmas card - it is amazing how big all your kids have gotten. Ayslan
                                                                     1
