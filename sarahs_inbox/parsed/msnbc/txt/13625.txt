           Exactly. That's what I mean when I say we've had such few "asks" of the legislature -
           they've all been good for Alaska, yet we end up with so little after essentially
           conceeding so, so much . They constantly "one-up" Alaskans/us. A change in tactic must
           occur or special session and next year will just be another repeat of us working our butts
           off and only being able to take the tiniest of baby steps towards reform... and we'll need
           very impacting messages to be publicized about all these shenanigans. I've cc'd Comm.
           Dept.

           I missed Wesley 's but will check it out.



           Don't know why we pussyfoot around these guys who are 1) asking for millions in capital
           projects and 2) refusing to lift burdensome fees on the backs off Alaskans, small
           businesses.  Let alone refusing to address the slanted playing field killing the state's
           smaller medical facilities.

            Frank- did you see wesley's blog on biz lic? Shoot. Don't know who's idea it was, but it
            was all about transparency! Letting alaskans know who was sitting on important bills(s).
            Stedman's comment was the email shouldn't have been sent, instead the chairman should have
            been requested to move it! What a joke. How many times was he asked to move it? Well maybe
            the blog/story will give the issue publicity and the follow up can open a door to also
            speak about tire tax and other good bills they're still trying to kill because they're
            either greedy spenders and/or they hate to see our name on anything that could pass. I
            wish Mike wouldn't have given a "no comment" comment in reply to Wesley's questions on
            this.

            Hilarious!



            Reminds me of the Homer Library luncheon where Lt Gov Leman's lunch barely fetched $200,
            and Candidate Palin's lunch fetched $650 for the Library Foundation.



            John and Nicole?     Harris is married??

            Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items
            was a package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch
            w/Binkley and his wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one
            bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500. :)
