            Subject: Draft Press Release for Possible Use on Monday




            Sharon:



           A draft press release that could be used on Monday when / if the Governor's CAPSTONE bill
           passes the House on Monday is attached. Feel free to use or not use or edit as you see
           fit.   (If we decide to issue a release, we will need to watch the vote count on Monday to
           make sure it passes unanimously on the House side)



           Randy



           Everyone:



           If you have edits, please get them to Sharon Monday morning.



           Randy
