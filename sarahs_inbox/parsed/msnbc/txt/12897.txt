                      Ballots cast in the SU contract ratification vote were counted tonight in the
             Anchorage Field Office of the APEA /AFT. The majority of the members who cast ballots,
             voted to ratify the contract.



                       NEARLY 85% OF THE ENTIRE SUPERVISORY UNIT VOTED!!!



                       Thanks for all the participation and support throughout the process.



                       Your negotiating team.
