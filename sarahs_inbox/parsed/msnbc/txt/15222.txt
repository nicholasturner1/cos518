                 Subject: Thursday

               FYI, spoke with Balash this morning . He is taking a break today from the gasline discussions and will focus in on
               details related to the energy plan for Thursday. He'll be working w/Steve on it today and will coordinate also
               w/Rosanne & Sharon . So, hopefully we'll have more info this afternoon.
