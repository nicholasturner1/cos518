MESSAGE:

Just want to Congratulate you and your husband on that sweet little baby boy. I adopted a little girl,
age 2 , from California that has Downs Syndrome, about 5 years ago. She is now 7. She was also
born drug addicted which added to her issues, but she is coming along, and the light of my life. I am
sure that your new son will bring you much happiness.

Mary and Ebonie Santos
