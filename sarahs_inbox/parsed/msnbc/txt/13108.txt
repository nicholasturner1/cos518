                Subject: Owen Appeal and Atty. Ralph Cashen

              Dear Governor Palin and Randy,
                   There is an attorney named Ralph Cashen who is trying to contact various people about his client former
              Nome Police officer Owen who was convicted of murder. He is appealing the conviction and is trying to re-open
              the investigation . He called me and wants to get me to have the troopers reopen the case because he has a 'firm
              belief' of his client's innocence and believes the Governor would agree with him . He asked for my support to
              push for a new investigation and absent that my "permission' to talk to the Governor. Privileged or Person alI
                                                                                                                         al A!
              Prp. He is being told by my staff that I will not attempt to intervene in the case and that I cannot prevent
              him from talking to anyone including the Governor . So, he may call the Governor . He might imply he has my
              permission to do so because I have not attempted to stop him . Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
