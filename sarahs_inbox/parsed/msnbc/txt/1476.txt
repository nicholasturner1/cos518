Todd - I know you're swamped - just wondered if you 'd seen this email yet and if you or the Governor

Todd - I would guess that this person is asking for a letter of recommendation from the Governor.
Please let me know if you would like one sent and I will ask that it be written by Cody. Thanks,
Janice
