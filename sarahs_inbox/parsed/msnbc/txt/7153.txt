        Subject:                   Sp session


        Interviewed by Donaldson just now (pls add to schedule, Kari) and told him again "yes" on
        ppt special session once we get logistics wkd out, but not intending sp session on Sr Care
        unless/until Rep Harris talks to us about what they want to do to fix the problem they
        created by not funding our request in budget for this nor Longevity Bonus. In meantime
        we'll keep finding the money for Sr Care continuation, plus be clear about asking for
        supplemental next yr to cover costs be we WILL keep funding it somehow even if we dont
        have sp session on it.
