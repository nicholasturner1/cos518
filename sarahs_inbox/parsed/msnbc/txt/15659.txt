                  Subject: Jack Wheeler piece

                Thought you might want to see this. Its a short piece from Jack Wheeler "to the point" report.

                One politician deserving of HFR praise this week is Alaska governor Sarah Palin. To get an idea of
                what a hero she is, here's the demonizing headline of today's (5/23) London Times: Protecting Polar
                Bear Gets In The Way of Drilling For Oil Says Governor. She actually has the guts to sue the Federales
                for ludicrously listing polar bears as "threatened" when their population is exploding.

               The whole entire purpose of the phony listing is to use the fascist Endangered Species Act (ESA) as a
               rationale to prevent oil drilling - and Gov. Pallin is exposing it. As columnist George Will notes, with
               this polar bear ruling, the enviro-fascists are now in a position to use the ESA to regulate anything.

               So let's all toast Governor Sarah - not only the hottest governor in the US, but also the gutsiest. No
               wonder a lot of folks want her to be McCain's running-mate.
