                Subject: Bill signing at Richard Foster's office

              You might know this already... but Rep. Richard Foster's son, Neil, was in my office with Andy Baker as they are
              co-chairs of AWIB (Alaska Workforce Investment Board). Neil said he plans to show up at your bill signing in his
              dad's office.
