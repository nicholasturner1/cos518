Good morning,



No problem canceling your flight, sorry you couldn't make it. I'm

sure Track's happy to have you home!



The schools, city and state are closed, so the staff won't be at the

House today. I will call and let the Governor know at about 8am. or

so... I'll check in with them to make sure they have enough food,

heat, etc...



I can book flights from here, and might go into the office when the

roads clear up a bit. We can try to jump the Jetta if you want to at

least let us give that a try. Just shoot me an email or give me a

call if you need anything.



Take care,

Erika
