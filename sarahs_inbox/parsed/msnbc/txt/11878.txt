           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin




           On KBYR the other day they mentioned that you had not endorsed

          a presidential Republican. You were waiting to hear from Gov Huckaby and Sen McCain.. This
          concerns me that you would not endorse Gov Romney..I cannot help but feel that the
          national press is lining up behind Sen McCain..The only reason this would happen is if
          they are afraid Gov Romney would be a formidable opponent but that Sen. McCain is
          immensely beatable and set up the stage for a clear Democratic victory in November. Sen
          McCain has not been a friend to Alaska. A strong opponent to opening Anwar. Gov Huckaby
          has some good ideas but lacks the experience , especially in dealing with Islamic
          Terrorism. The single most important obstacle facing this nation and for that matter the
          entire exhistance of civilization as we know it-This is my opinion of course , but I feel
          that Gov Romney possesses the necessary qualities for the job. I would be interested in
          your thinking on this subject. I met you when you were on the campaign trail at the Aspen
          Hotel in Soldotna. You were preparing for

            a radio appearance on KDLL. You asked me how you

          should respond to the question why you would be a better Governor than Tony Knowles. I was
          impressed that you would ask.

          Keep up the good work as our Governor

          Sincerely..Cal Bowen
