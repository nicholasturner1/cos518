            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin and family,

            Congrats on the good news of your baby on the way !  One of the radio stations here in
            Anchorage , were talking this morning about baby names for you .  I thought I would email
            you my name suggestion .  I think Agia would be a cute name for a girl .  One of my co-
            workers took that one step further and said how about Agiavonnie ( Agia for short). I wish
            the best for you and your family and congrats again!   Becky Priddy
