         Thanks so much Kris. This is excellent progress.



         Thank you, also, Leo and Emil. I know we're doing the right thing here to finally get
         going on putting together a comprehensive energy plan for Alaska.

        Subject: Follow-up



        In follow-up to this afternoon's meeting:




        I spoke to Mike Tibbles and he wil be talking with personnel. I will be sure to follow-up
        in the morning.



        Secondly, I verified - as suspected - that the claims regarding Jim Palin are false. He
        was asked by Jim Strandberg, Project Manager w/AEA, to serve on an advisory committee. The
        committee doesn't sound as though it is even finalized as they have not even met yet and
        the members haven't been solidified. Further, I verified that Jim Palin is not consulting
        for anyone.




        Needless to say, it is unfortunate that these false claims were even brought up in the
        first place.



        Thank you for taking care of this and I'll be sure to follow-up with each of you tomorrow
        on the documentation.



        Kris
