         MESSAGE:

          Ms. Palin,




          I wanted to send you a quick note to request that you accept if John McCain were to select
         you as his running mate. I realize you have considerable responsibilities at the moment
         between being a good mother and governing a state larger than some countries, but the
         nation needs someone like you to lead us in these trying times. If John McCain does not
         win the presidency, I fear for the economic and political trouble that we may face, and
          some say you might be the last hope in a dismal Republican year (having a 90% approval
         ,rating as governor of any state is simply astounding).




         Although I am 26, I have never given money to any campaign. If it is a McCain/Palin
         ticket, however, I will donate as much money as I can reasonably afford to the RNC (it is
         my understanding that because Senator McCain will accept public funds, he will be
         ineligible'to receive donations for a General Election).




                                                               1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0018723
