            MESSAGE:

            Dear Sarah,

            Congratulations to you, your husband, and family on the birth of little Trig! You're in my
            prayers for all the best for Trig.



            I'm also writing to ask your continued support for the University of Alaska. Our capital
            budget promises to bring advances in health care education with the new Health Sciences
            building and general wellness with plans for a new athletic center.



            Thank you for making UA a priority among many.



            Best wishes,



            Annie Route

            Anchorage, AK
