        We just notified the sponsors of the water-mining initiative that I was

        denying certification of that initiative (Tim McKeever is their lawyer that

        we notified).      We got good input from Sharon on the press release and have

        made changes there, but have not sent that out yet. We will send press

        release and talking points soon, I believe. (We haven't notified the press

        yet.)
