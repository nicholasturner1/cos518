             Bob or Randy: When did the AST organization begin (how long before statehood)? And what
             are the.three adjectives printed on the sides of their patrol cars?

                 Kris- pis schedule another in-person meeting between me and Mr. Kopp today. I'll call
             Talis when I need him there.

                 Mike- Mr. Kopp said you only met with him 20 minutes last week, others have insisted
             it was closer to two hours. What's your recollection?
