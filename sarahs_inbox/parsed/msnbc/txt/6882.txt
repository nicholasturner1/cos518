            Governor,

           We've had several phone calls from people complimenting you on your selection . Congratulationsi

           Jeannie Phillips from the University called also to say that most of the student regent and student commissioner
           nominations called to ask when the announcement would be made for those vacancies . I let her know those
           appointments would be coming soon . Besides the student regent decision , there are also two students
           nominated to fill one seat on the Post Secondary Education Commission . Below is part of my observations from
           my interviews with them . I've copied the information on the regents that I sent you last week also . I'm sorry this
           is so much information-could be good reading for the flight : )

           Alaska Post Secondary Education Commission:

            Robert Bell, UAA: He's the current student commissioner and has applied for re -appointment. Privileged or PO
