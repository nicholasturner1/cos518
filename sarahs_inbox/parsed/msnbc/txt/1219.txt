MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of your 5th child. I am also a mother of five. I was 42 when my
youngest was born and my oldest child was 16 and the time. You will find that this child will bring out
the best in everyone. Life will be anything but boring, I promise you that. I don't even know you but I
have the greatest respect for you. You say he has special challenges, I believe that will only make life
better. God Bless all of you. Sincerely, Katie
