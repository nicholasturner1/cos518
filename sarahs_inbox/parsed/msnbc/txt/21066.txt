            Thought it was great that you could cover the state's direction and policy as governor and I
            could take it to a personal level. Kate commented that was one , of many things, that worked
            well for us in the duo speaking arrangement ... and you , again , blew me away with your kind
            remarks . Thank you.

            I'll be in Nome and surrounding villages Monday and Tuesday with Larry Hartig.
