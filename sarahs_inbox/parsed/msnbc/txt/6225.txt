         Subject :                 Bitney


         Bitney finally cleaned out his Juneau office, and upon hearing who he had gleefully
         assisting him with the task, a few more pieces of a puzzle come together. Kevin Jardell
         was his guy - and its making some sense that Kevin has been kept in some loops that harm
         administration's mission to clean up Juneau politics.



         Don't waste your time reading the ADN blog, but know that entries there provide fodder for
         the media to write stories around - Kris and I looked at it recently and have been
         fascinated by one blogger's turn-around from his support of administration to his slamming
         of us the past few weeks, all because of Bitney's departure. The blogger is Paul Fuhs (he
         told us his pen name months ago) and he's done a one-eighty. Another blogger who all along
         has sounded like an "insider", but has been on a constant anti-AGIA rage, has got to be
         Jardell. And he knew and posted AGIA info before things were made public, and has been
         extremely critical of ethics reform and AGIA, posting in advance info that we talked about
         internally, but of course spinning it negatively.



         Anyway, as more is revealed, more makes sense about some of the internal problems we had
         with communications.



        Thanks guys - hope the weekend is refreshing for you:
