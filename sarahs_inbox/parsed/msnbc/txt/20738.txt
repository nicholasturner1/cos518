              Hey Trig. Boy, did you luck out. Somebody up above must have pulled some strings to get you borned of the
              greatest family in Alaska and America ; On the other hand , your parents got the best kid too . So, I guess it's just a
              good match. Hang in, Buddy ! Ron Martin, GA.
