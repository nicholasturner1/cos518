           Subject: Veto



           Folks, I was out of town logging for the last week and when I got

           home I found out Monday from Lyman Hoffman's wife Lit (he was out)

           that Governor Palin did veto the $2 million on Friday.                 Needless to

           say I am deeply disappointed.         I hope all of us will contact the

           governors office letting her know that you too are disappointed by

           this action.       Despite the setback we move forward.              For the last

           30 years it has broken my heart whenever there was a drowning in

           this area and that will continue as I know if folks get water safety

           training and the opportunity to learn how to swim the number of

           deaths by drowning will decrease and I wonder why this is so

          difficult to see.        I have cc'd this to Lyman, Mary & Governor Palin.
