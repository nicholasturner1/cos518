                 Subject: Beginning today...
                Our Alaska Native Sisterhood Camp 2 sisters have been extremely busy organizing a
                Southeast Alaska Native Women's Conference that begins today; $25 registration -
                there are limited scholarships! I am forwarding you a copy of the wonderful program for
                the next three days featuring speakers such as Florence Sheakley, Laird Jones, Ruth
                Demmert and panel: Alberta Aspen, Corrine Ragu and Micalyn Kunz McGhee, Iva
                Graywolf, Healing Ceremony, and a number of others. Iva will be speaking about
                suicide prevention. Hopefully our local Native organizations will allow interested staff to
                participate in this conference and support our local ANS Camp 2.

                The theme for the conference speaks for itself, "Making a Difference : Knowledge of Our
                Mothers keeping our Culture alive". The conference pays tribute in many different and
                creative ways ; something you don 't want to miss out on ! Please see the various forms
                that come with the packet.

                If you know of any person who would be interested in attending this conference please
                share the news ; we need community support . There is a welcome dinner planned this
                evening ; we are going to cook: Grilled King Salmon , Roast Pork, rice, buttered corn,
                salad and a dinner roll. Dessert too! Come and visit; bring those special people in your
                life; grandmother , mom; tell your family! Let's make a difference together.
