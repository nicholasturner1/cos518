             Annette- I'm not quite clear on what you're asking- were you told that someone appears to
             have logged on to my computer- I need to know who because no one is authorized to do so.

             Governor:

             I understand through Wyatt-Kevin Brooks-Mike Nizich that you want to be sure no
             unauthorized person signed onto your computer in your Anchorage office.



             Because of the protocols you and I discussed for viewing anyone else's computer (let alone
             the Governor's) I need to confirm with you that this is your request. Once I hear from
             you, I'll request it be looked at with unauthorized or attempted unauthorized use the
             focus of the investigation.

                                                                     1
