          Thank you very much Governor Sarah for trying to help us with out high energy costs. I,m
          a senior and having a hard time to pay my gas bill plus utility bills. Your ideal about
          debit card is great I hope our repersentetives will past this bill and not try to add
          there spin on it.



          I think you are doing a great job .        I,m so glad I supported you.




         Congratulations on new baby '!!!!!!!!!!
