            Governor - we did not confirm an appointment until we know when we can do this per your
            schedule.  Janice

            Did the previously scheduled 6:30pm appt get canceled tonight, due to my travels to
            Fairbanks after the funeral? Hopefully, as I won 't be making it into Anchorage to meet
            with the scheduled individual.
