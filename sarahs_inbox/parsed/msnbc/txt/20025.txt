              Kyle Hopkins filmed a little over 4 minutes of the Gov 's press conference with Stevens three weeks ago. Here is
              the link: http://community adn com/adnfblog/24417?page=5

              Here is the transcript of the opening comments:

              KB: Governor, your appearance here was kind of a surprise today. Can you tell me
              about how that came about and whether we should see that as kind of an endorsement
              for Sen. Stevens for re-election?

              Gov: Well, it's um...I'm on the clock and we're in a Federal Building, so we won't
              talk about campaigns or endorsements, all that comes later , but I support the
              Senator's proposals here and his passion to again allow Alaska to be heard and to
              lead with an American energy policy that has been - I believe - sorely lacking.
              And it is time to step up, work together, others are looking to us, to see how we
              are going to work together through this energy crisis and from here, forward, so
              I'm honored to get to be here and certainly an entire team working with us, we are
              going to be able to create the best solutions all working together. So, I'm
              honored to get to be here with him.

              Sen: No, no, no announcements will be made here about - political announcements
              won't be made in this room.

              Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

              Kate

             I can't find that reference from Baldino. Pls find her specific quote so you can
             give to Sharon so she can (again) correct the 10 pm's mistake.

             Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll askSharon to
             check on what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check. I
             said weeks ago "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate.
             Those who were with me at the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

              don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote
              you from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth
              coming.  don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try
              to further shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
