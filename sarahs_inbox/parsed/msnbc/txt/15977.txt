           Security said they did not know I was going to NGA, I told them I was sure I gave the word
           that I'd be attending many months ago. Pls let whomever needs to know that I will be
           attending. (National security guys needed us to rsvp, evidently). I don't know on these
           travels who knows what or who needs to know for arrangements to be made... Who else should
           I inform before big trips like this one coming up in July?

           Also, any word on First Family tickets yet so we don't wait til last minute and pay
           outrageous prices for tickets?
