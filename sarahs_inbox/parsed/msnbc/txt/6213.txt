         OK.  For some reason, they require that I sign and have notarized a form that states I
         have talked to you about the case.



         A new request just came in regarding a case from Oregon. A man has fled on charges of
         burglary in the first degree and violation of his terms of parole. If you are OK, I will
         sign that one as well.

         Subject : Extradition




        Governor,




        I have two extradition orders here that I should sign. One is for a fugitive in Alaska
        who committed multiple offenses in the State of California including 2 counts of selling a
                                                                    1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 0003151

          controlled substance , possession and operating a vehicle under the influence of a
          controlled substance .  The other order is for a fugitive from Washington that has been
          charged with burglary in the first degree , malicious mischief in the first degree, theft
          in the first degree , felony harassment , possession of explosives without a permit, and
          possession of a short-barreled shotgun.



          To authorize the extraditions, I do need to sign an affidavit stating that I have
          personally talked to you by phone and you authorized me to sign the orders. I was unable
          to reach you on the cell but if we could touch base briefly , I can get these back to the
          criminal division for action . Thank you.



          Mike
