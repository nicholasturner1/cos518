                 Subject: Rep. Lynn's HB 287 - Divest from companies doing-business in Sudan

               Governor:

               At your request, I reviewed HB 287. The bill would place a number of new obligations on the
               Alaska Permanent Fund, including divesting from companies that do business with Sudan.
               (The Sudanese government is accused of sponsoring genocide against civilians in Darfur) The
               bill's prime sponsors are Rep. Lynn and Rep. Gara.

               The bill has been heard once this session in House State Affairs. Mike Burns of the Permanent
               Fund testified against the bill ("we do not believe that investment decisions made for social or
               political reasons are in the best interest of the permanent fund.") The permanent fund also
               produced a fiscal note estimating costs at nearly $11 million for FY 2009, and about $8 million
               a year for every year thereafter. The permanent fund attributes most of these costs to fund
               managers raising their rates for having to change how they handle their portfolios.
