           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin,

           I have been combing through US Governors and Legislators searching for a good fit for John
           McCain's VP.  I think you are it! I love your pro-life stand, economic conservatism,
           (loved what you did with the plane!), equal rights for gays without sanctioning their
           agenda, congeniality win, and I suppose youth and beauty doesn't hurt either. I think we
           will see more of you in the future. Keep up the good work!



           Sincerely,



           Laura Gibson
