            MESSAGE:

           Just read an article on Yahoo about the birth of your new son.  Congrat!!  You have just
           been give the greatest gift!! I have a son with Down's Syndrome. He is now 26 years old.
           He has always been the light of my life. He can make a person smile in a minute and has
           done so in stores all his life. Use your experience to make like better for the
           differently abled persons of this country. My family and I have had to fight every step
           of the way to get Chris where he is today. We continue to fight now for him to have as
           close to a "normal" life as possible.



           Just wanted to drop you a line and tell you to enjoy the new years as your son grows.
