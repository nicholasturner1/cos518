             My take away from the story was that you are pushing for what is right for alaska
             regardless of what party or who the sponsor is. Lyda did get a cheap shot in saying that
             you have been gone for several weeks but your response was very good about having cell
             phone and regular phone access . An unbiased view from my Aunt watching my daughter was
             that you looked great, especially holding up the phone saying that you are very
             accessible.  She was very convinced.



             We will play nice for a while but I am convinced that we did the right thing sending a
             message that we are not afraid to play hardball, especially as we get into gasline
             hearings.



             A little off of what we planned for the day but I think you did a great job.

             Shoot - ktuu's coverage of the ethics issue made lyda look like she was on the high rd by
             basically claiming I was inaccesible and we just don't understand the process ...
