          Governor,



          Kami Clark (IT) came over on Monday, 8/4. My understanding is that this had been
          coordinated by Mike Nizich with the Governor's Office IT staff. Susan merely answered the
          phone call that day and notified me when they were to arrive that morning. As far as staff
          was concerned they thought it was regular maintenance.



          I apologize for not notifying you of this; I thought you were aware that this was taking
          place.



          Thanks,

          Erika

          If anyone has an answer, pls let me know asap:

         I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House
         offices to get emails from computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my
         bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were the reasons given and
         responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it
         was that this occurred. Thank you
