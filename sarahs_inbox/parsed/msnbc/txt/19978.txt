            Wielechowski should be fine tomorrow morning when you get to talk with him.



            Donny Olson is in Nome tonight but will be back tomorrow in time for a meeting. He
            suggested 1 or 1:30. I told him I will check in with his staff at Noon to coordinate
            location and the specific time.



            See you at 8:00 am.
