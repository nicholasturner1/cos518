            If the Governor agrees, can we work Vic Fischer in the next two weeks? She told him earlier in the year
            she would meet with him. Karl.

            Hi Kari -

            I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with Governor Palin in Anchorage to talk about
            appointments to the Local Boundary Commission and implementing Alaska 's constitution with
            respect to boroughs.

            My cell phone number is 907-351-6359.

            Thank you,

            Vic Fischer
