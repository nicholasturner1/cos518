           Privileged orPer Let me know your thoughts, otherwise let's form this asap mw an                        ee   an y
            I'd like to work w you guys on this as Sharon announces the intention.

              Also, feedback over the weekend was that this issue of me supposedly "firing Walt for
            personal/personnel reasons" has taken on a life of its own. Frustration over not just
            being able to sit down with reporters and repeat the truth, and/or get the message
            directly to Alaskans about the whole issue was shared with me by many. Amazing how the
            misperceptions have really grown legs and now people (incl legislators) are running with
            them.

               We need to do all we can to get the truth out, I would hope the press would be fair in
            giving me opportunity to speak to the issue. This controversy - and Senate's rumored
            investigation   is suspiciously overshadowing AGIA and Energy work- please help get that
            back on track but also help me get truth out surrounding the desire to move Walt to a
            different position so DPS could see action leading to results, versus merely talking about
            crafting more plans to deal with public safety challenges.

               Between the FOIA's last week (and the public still doesn't understand it's been a
            ConocoPhillips employee FOIA-ing emails) and Walt's stirred-up controversy, the whole AGIA
            issue was overshadowed and attention shifted from.that to other things. Please assist me
            in helping Alaskans realize the importance of the pending legislation on the lawmakers'
            plates today. Thanks
