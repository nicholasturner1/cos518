            Karen:




            I    followed up on 3 budget items:




            1.      KAKE SEARCH AND RESCUE BOAT -   Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


            The $1.5 million for a search and rescue vessel in Kake. In comments to

           the public at a Native Issues forum, Rep. Thomas said this appropriation

           was justified for two main reasons. The first reason is search and

           rescue in the vicinity of Kake. Thomas mentioned that a few years ago

           there was an emergency and fish and game gave the rescuers a 16 foot

           boston whaler to go out in bad weather and everyone was almost lost.

           The second reason he mentions that is that with all the cruise ships
                                                                  1




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01_0017923

           going by, the vessel needs to have oil spill response capability to

           deploy booms, etc.

           2.   ALASKA SHIP AND DRYDOCK - DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -         Privileged or Personal

        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted                       Sara FisherGoad said

           she checked with her folks and this is for corrosion control systems at

           the shipyard that will help preserve a state asset from damage by

           saltwater.



           3.   STUDY FOR IMPACTS OF CRUISE SHIP VISITORS - $350,000 I talked to

           Sally Saddler.     The study results would be used to defend appropriations

           in the budget of cruise ship tax funds. If the study shows impacts of

           cruise ship visitors are felt in areas off the coast, it could help

           support use of the funds for projects off the coast. The main reason

           for the high cost is that Commerce intends to conduct actual interviews

           instead of mailing surveys with hopes of getting very high quality

           responses.    Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                                                                                                          PRA_GSP01_0017924
