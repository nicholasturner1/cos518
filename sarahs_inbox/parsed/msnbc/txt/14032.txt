             Lt. Gov Parnell,

             Your office and that of the Governor are the very ones that MUST

             weigh-in and ensure that the safety of the Alaska Citizens are provided for.

             Sir, your office and that of Gov. Palin must direct the Dept. Of

             Administration to meet the needs of the Dept. of Public Safety. Contact

             Comm. Kreitzer immediately and direct her to meet the needs of the Dept.

             of Public Safety and make them competitive in the work place so that the

             citizens of Alaska may obtain the BEST law enforcement officers available.



             As for "a positive outcome to negotiations", your administration has

             already shown that will not occur. The DOA has stood fast on their

             substandard and insulting offers to our association.              YOUR

             administration has attempted to take away rights and benefits YOUR State

             Troopers DESERVE forcing these negotiations to the drawn out arbitration

             phase.     YOUR State Troopers and the safety of Alaska's Citizens will

             continue to suffer even longer because YOUR administration has failed to

             obtain a "positive outcome to negotiations."



             Lt. Gov. I'm saddened by your response and the lack of action by your

             office and that of Gov. Palin. You are a true politician. All talk and

             zero action.     I think Don Young is one of the most arrogant individuals

             I've ever met.     And I met him, in D.C., in his office. But he says what

             he means and does what he says. A few weeks ago I welcomed the

             opportunity to vote him out. But I'd rather have an individual say what

            he thinks rather than post on his web site how important safety is to

             the citizens of Alaska but not follow through with it.                As I write this

             letter Lt. Gov the very co-worker, who sits next to me, is leaving State

             Service due to poor wages, benefits, and public perception of the Alaska

                                                                   1

             State Troopers.     Just another body we have to try and replace and spend

             countless dollars to train.



             I think Don Young would find your position and the crisis DPS faces very

             interesting as the race for HIS seat heats up .      I wish I could stand on

             your "corner" carrying your "sign."



             Best Wishes,
