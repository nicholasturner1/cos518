             I believe you are doing a great job as our Governor of Akaska!

             I support your decision on the 25% profit oil tax....i'm hoping the Senate will quickly
             approve like the House and finally adjourn-so all can enjoy Thanksgiving!!



             I also support you in having meetings around Alaska to do Alaska' s business and to learn
             firat hand about each locations needs, etc.
