          Thanks ivy. I want to make sure talis and others know I'm blessing your efforts here.
          Otherwise Mike will try to put a stop to these good efforts I'm afraid. So cc me in when
          .you email the guys or I'll cc you in when I'm talking to them about the efforts they need
          to hustle on to get this done. Thanks

           A <<Georgia Exec Order suspend gas tax .pdf>> G/ Commissioner:




          Upon further review, Georgia suspended the state' s gas tax in 8 days. Governor Perdue
         issued an executive order on September 2, 2005 and the Legislature ratified the order on
         September 10.

           I've attached two Georgia executive orders for your review.  One suspends the state's gas
          tax for 1 month and the other lowers the state sales tax on natural gas for home heating
          for 4 months.

           Just a few thoughts for your consideration.




          Have a good weekend,




          Ivy
