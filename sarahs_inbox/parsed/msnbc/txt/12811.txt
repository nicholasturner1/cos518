           MESSAGE:

           Hello Mrs. Palin,



           I recently watch your KTLA interview online. I was very impressed with you answers,
           specificly those regarding your looks. You handled them with grace and conviction.



           As a young woman I felt inspired, and I certainly wish that you are selected as the Vice
           Presidential candidate!  You give hope to all young, working mothers. Please call John
           McCain and "apply" for the job, if not for yourself, for us.



           Lauren.
