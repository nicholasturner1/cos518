             It will be Q&A with you and Gov. Napolitano.              Moderator is Karen Breslau    ( Newsweek San Fran
             Bureau Chief who interviewed you).



             In the binder that we sent up this evening, which should be in the Anchorage office
             tomorrow, we have a full agenda including list of those on the agenda who will provide
             welcome remarks.



             Included is this information from my conversation with Karen:



             Karen Breslau will be the moderator. She will visit with both governors before taking the
             stage to discuss the conversation and how she anticipates the event will unfold. Karen
             said it would be a "conversation" between two "such accomplished governors from very
             different places on the political spectrum." She said, "Two governors just dishing!"



             "Tell her (Governor Palin), `Just bring your brain ,," Karen said . She anticipates that the
             conversation will include:



             ?      Notion of partisanship - how you've         overcome it as you ' ve served in public office.

             ?     How both governors have managed to be very successful in taking a non - partisan
             approach to problem solving ... discuss particularly in light of presidential campaign.

             ?     Talk about governors' impressions - of the presidential campaign, Napolitano has
             come out for Obama - will ask if Governor Palin is going to endorse.
