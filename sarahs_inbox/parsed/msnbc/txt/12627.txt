            The State of Alaska contributes a significant amount of funding to rural Alaska in areas
            funded by the Denali commission on an annual basis.  What we have not done a good job of
            is connecting state resources with those of the Denali Commission. As the governor's co-
            chair designee, I have been trying to figure out how best to accomplish that in terms of
            conflicting budget cycles and processes.

            Absent a direct appropriation of state GF for Denali Commission projects, there will
            continue to be criticism that we are not "partnering" with the commission. DCCED has been
            recommending that we take a pretty strong stand on rural policy issues and drive the
            discussion with the commission. I continue to say we are making progress and believe that
            we are.

            I also know that George intends to work with the legislature to add funds to the state
            budget - don't know what that looks like yet and I have asked him to let me know what he
            is advocating for - KJR

           I wanted to make sure that you had seen this. Implicating the State is not fair or
           accurate, but I'm not sure how many of these we can respond to.

           Denali Commission on shaky ground . Sen. Ted Stevens says the commission he created that
           has been responsible for pumping tens of millions of dollars into Alaska projects , most of
           them rural , faces an uncertain future , according to an
           <http :// www.alaskajournal . com/stories / 030208 / hom_20080302002.shtml > Alaska Journal of
           Commerce story . Federal funding cuts and slim contributions from the state are putting it
           in jeopardy , he told the paper.

           The commission has about $ 110 million to spend this year , down from $ 130 million last year
           and $150 million three years ago, the story says . Gov. Sarah Palin has said she backs the
           commission but has made no commitments so far , according to co - chair George Cannelos, co-
           chair of the commission.
