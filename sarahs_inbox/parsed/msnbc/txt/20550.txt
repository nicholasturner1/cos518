               Good quote, thank you.
               Regarding another aspect of all this recent APOC complaining issue on both predator control
               AND the mining initiative:
               If you want to personalize my quotes more (if you believe it helps), say: "Alaskans expect me to
               give an opinion when asked, which is what I do in exercising my First Amendment rights when
               I'm asked about important issues affecting our state," Patin said. "I haven't hesitated in giving my
               personal opinion on predator control and the mining initiative, for instance, because Alaskans
               know by now I'll take a stand and share my opinion if they ask to hear it."

               "I'm pleased that APOC's commissioners understood that the information we prepared was
               non-political and that we never intended to take sides in the debate on the ballot measure, "
               said Denby Lloyd, Commissioner of ADF&G. "There has been a huge amount of public
               discourse on and public interest in predator management , and we knew, as did the Board of
               Game, that Alaskans would need factual materials about these important programs at this
               time of the year."

               Governor Sarah Patin agreed . " It is part of the mission of our state agencies to inform the
               public and to make sure they have access to the facts," she said. "When both sides of a
               political debate are making claims about an important public policy issue, our experts must
               be free to explain these programs to the public."
