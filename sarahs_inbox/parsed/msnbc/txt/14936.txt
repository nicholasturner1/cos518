           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:



           I first wish to congratulate you on the birth of your new baby. I read with interest that
           your infant was born with Down Syndrome.



           I too have a now 29 year old son with Down Syndrome who is the subject of a newly
           published book I have written about parenting Thomas.



           I too have four son and have been happily married for 39 years.



           At the risk of being presumptuous, I will mail you a copy Of Granite and Tigers: The
           Parenting of Thomas.



           Once again Congratulations, and I do hope you see fit to accept my book.



           Sincerely,




                                                                1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0017169
