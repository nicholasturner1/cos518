                  FOUR VERY IMPORTANT THINGS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

               1. Chugach Electric should not be controlled by the IBEW union.

               4. Your Chugach ballot is worth thousands of dollars to your family in better cost control at
               Chugach. Don't throw it away! It's well worth your time to spend a few minutes voting.




               1. If you haven't voted for your representative on the Chugach Electric Board of Directors,
               please locate your large white envelope from Chugach Electric, and use the ballot to vote
               for Uwe, Rebecca and Liz. If you can't find your envelope, another will immediately be sent
               to you by calling 566-1700. Call now, 566-1700.

               2. If you have voted, and were misled, it's too late for you to change your vote. But you can
               spread the word and encourage others to search for their Chugach envelopes, or request a
               duplicate, and vote for Uwe, Rebecca and Liz.

              3. If you have voted for Uwe, Rebecca and Liz, you will be rewarded by an independent
              Chugach Electric, free from IBEW control and providing the best, most reliable electricity at
              the lowest cost possible.

                                                           Thank you!
