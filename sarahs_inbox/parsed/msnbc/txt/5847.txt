             what does it cost - who pays - for sponsorship?

              Pete and Denise Christopher (managers of the Miners ) called regarding the upcoming season.
              They are working on putting together a "Governor Palin Day at the Park " in June . They said
              Rep. Stoltze was working on organizing it, but thought we all should be in the loop . Also, there's
              a Miners baseball clinic for Valley kids that the Mat -Su Delegation usually sponsors. They
              haven' t shown as much interest as years past. If Governor Palin is interested in sponsoring the
              clinic it could coincide with the "Governor Palin Day at the Park " game . The kids get shirts and
              other things that say something like "Mat-Su Miners Baseball Clinic sponsored by Governor
              Palin."

              If this is something we want to pursue I can pass the contact information on to Karl . Just let me
              know how (if at all) you want to proceed.

              Thanks,
