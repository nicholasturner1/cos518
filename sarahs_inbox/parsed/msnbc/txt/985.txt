Thanks. I had let him know it was all taken care of also. I told him he didn't need to fly in early to pick
us up- we'd find a ride.

       Done deal, Talked with Gary this morning . Dan Rohrer will pick us up, take us to the debate,
then drop us back off immediately after . You've met Dan at Kodiak Chamber of commerce and his
parents Dick and Sue Rohrer , good solid small business owner... no controversy.

               Frank- if u can find someone already in Kodiak to pick us up at airport (or we could take a
cab), let me know so security doesn't have to travel early in order to get us to the school for the two-
hr event ... I talked to Gary about that this morning . Thanks. It'll be a ride for the four of us , a neutral
person not M or anyone too controversial to pick us up . Thanks!
