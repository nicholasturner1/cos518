  William T. Taylor

  William Thomas Taylor, 77, passed away at home into the arms of Jesus on Friday , Feb. 23,
  2007.

  Bill was born in Kinston, N.C. on Oct. 1, 1929, to Kate Smith Taylor and Guy Taylor.

  Growing up in tough times without a father, he learned to fish and hunt to help feed his family.

  Bill's mother gave permission for him to join the Army at 17 to serve in the 82nd Airborne
  Paratrooper Division. After basic, he switched places with another soldier once he learned that
  every other person was being sent to Japan, so he could come to Alaska in a combat rifle team.

  Alaska was not as sweet as he thought it would be and he had his mother write the territorial
  governor to get him out of here. But it didn't take long for him to take a liking to Alaska. When
  he was discharged in 1949 in Montana, he used his $600 separation check to return to Alaska.
  Bill loved Alaska and its people.

  In the early days, Bill used a dog team as transportation around Fairbanks. He worked at the base
  power plant, as a cab owner-operator, fought forest fires, delivered coal for Johnny's Express,
  and joined Teamsters Local 959 around 1959. He worked for Green Construction Co. for many
  years and retired from the Teamsters in 1978.

  Tanana rivers.

  built a fish processing plant in Manley Hot Springs, Yutana Fisheries.

  In the 1960s Bill put together a team for sprint racing. He won many races but was proudest of winning
