       Yes, you're right, and that is how we've been presenting the issue at the hearings. The
       article takes the perspective of comparing AGIA's legislative review process (veto) to the
       one in the SGDA (approval), and then characterizing it as a loss of legislative power.
       From the quotes of legislators in the article, that also seems to be how they are trying
       to frame the issue. During our hearings, we've reminded legislators of their discussions
       last year over whether the SGDA's required legislative approval was constitutional; we've
       pointed out that the veto structure of AGIA would have a stronger constitutional
       foundation, while protecting their ability to make sure the commissioners don't make a bad
       decision.



       AGIA provides the legislature with the role as a safety valve to prevent a mistake by the
       commissioners before we set off with a licensee. It does not require the legislature to
       meet and discuss what will hopefully be a well supported decision by the commissioners.
       SGDA required the legislature to convene and approve. AGIA gives them the option whether
       to convene, or just let it go.



       In all honesty, given what we heard at our legislative briefings before AGIA was
       introduced ("that will be our FIRST amendment"), we've had less push back on this so far
       than I expected. I think our approach has merit, and some legislators recognize that.
       We'll see...



       - Pat

       Not sure what juneau empire means as it writes legislature is asked to give up powers by
       merely blessing agia partner ... It's a sensible tactic considering speaker john harris
       said early on that I didn't have to, nor should I, bring it before the legislature for
       approval, no?

         Governor,    We will look at the tax credit suggestion, and see if there is some aspect of
         it we can use . On first blush, there are a few problems with the idea, though. Privileged or Pe

         folks looking for ways to try to solve this problem. It shows the public wants to provide
         something, but is struggling with us to figure out what is constitutional. -Pat From:

        Subject: gas tax Pat, et al: Here's a sound suggestion, it seems, from a friend. (Please
        see below.) May this be pursued???   Date: Sat, 17 Mar 2007 08:04:42 -0800 To:
        spalin@mtaonline.net Subject: Gas Tax Sorry to bother you. I know how many folks are
        trying to get your attention, but I couldn't help but write over the latest flap by the
        legislature regarding a possible Constitutional problem with your team's proposed 10 year
        gas tax exemption for pipeline builders. The solution seems obvious to me and is in the
        control of the legislature if they wish to support pipeline construction and avoid a
        Constitutional issue.  They can pass tax legislation now that says any company that helps
        build a gas pipeline will still calculate the tax an

        d file a return, but once gas flows they get a 10-year gas tax credit to be taken at the
        rate of one-tenth of the amount spent on construction each year or the amount of the tax,
        whichever is less. It would have to be carefully worded, but by passing it now it becomes
        a general tax credit provision that avoids constitutional problems and is not limited to
        any particular company or companies as part of a contract or agreement. It might be a
        good idea for your team to consider drafting proposed legislation and laying it on the
        table of the legislature. You could then say, "Here's a solution. Do you want a pipeline
        or not?" Good luck. By the way...you're doing a great job and from what I hear you're
        still getting a positive response from most state workers. --
