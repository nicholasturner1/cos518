              Lawren, from Vogue, wrote a real nice note of thanks... but also apologized if the shoot
              was such a negative experience as they read about in the press. :(     She said "they" were
              shocked to read the negative coverage of the experience. I jotted her a quick note back
              saying it was awesome and a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but if you could call her/them
              and reiterate that it was an honor to get to participate in this, maybe that could un-do
              some damage. Thanks:
