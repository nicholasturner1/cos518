           It would be helpful for wesley and other reporters to note who's not here again today
           (leadership), and who is here AGAIN today (for instance: lyda's competitor in her race,
           linda menard, is here again today).



           I can not believe sen prez and resources committee chairman arent here - esp after charlie                            I
           spent all that time in China recently to learn about a competing project - but won't spend
           time here learning about TC Alaska?
