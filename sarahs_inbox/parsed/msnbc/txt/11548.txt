             This is awesome . Very good, very supportive, very "right-on". I don't know if Joe will
             have edits... I think it's 100percent right on. Thanks! Have fun up there!

             Subject : CONFIDENTIAL : Fairbanks Chamber Speech tomorrow ( Tuesday)




             Joe,



             Would you please review this section of my speech for tomorrow at the Fairbanks Chamber
             and tell me if there are any "Oh my gosh , don't say that " parts to it . I recognize that
             John Ringstad is going to introduce me, Rick Solie is the Chair of the Chamber -- so I'm not
            exactly walking into an audience that will welcome this message . privileged or Personal Material
            RdvilpnPH or        I Material Redacted
           Privileged or Person if you have any suggestions, please me now.



            I'm also covering elections and education in the same speech so this is just an excerpt
            from a current draft . ( I don't really want to circulate it to the whole team at this point
            since I can ' t deal with email edits from 6-8 people plus my staff -- I'm just counting on
            you as the barometer here for message alignment with the team.)



            Thanks,



            Sean
