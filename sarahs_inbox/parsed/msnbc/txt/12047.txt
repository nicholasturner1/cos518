                Governor,
                The Upper Cook Inlet Board of Fish meeting is going fairly well so far, with only slight adjustments being made.
                The biggest issues are yet to come, and should be addressed tomorrow and the next day. See the e-mail below
                from Denby giving details so far . The Mat-Su folks should be happy about declaring Susitna River sockeye
                salmon a stock of concern . The eastside setnetters should be happy about extending the fishery until August
                15th, which will give them additional opportunity when runs are late . I will provide a more complete summary for
                you when the meeting is over.
                Cora

               Cora:

               We are in the meeting right now , and it will continue at least into or through tomorrow. Highlights thus far include:

               1. Prohibition of personal use fishing for sockeye in the lower Kenai River (which occurs in July) from boats
               powered by 2-stroke engines (other than direct fuel injection engines ); this parallels action recently approved by
               the Governor and DNR for the middle Kenai River.

               2. Susitna River sockeye salmon have been declared a stock of yield concern , in answer to requests and
               proposals from the Mat-Su region.

               3. Extension of the Upper Cook Inlet eastside set gill net fishery from a previous closure date of August 10 to a
               new closure date of August 15, with only two regular ( 12-hour) open periods allowed during the Aug 11 -15 time
               period.

               4. Liberalized sport fishing retention for early Kenai River Chinook salmon (for fish 20 -28 inches only).

               We have not gotten to the meat of the central Cook Inlet drift gill net fishery , nor to the escapement goal vs.
               closed windows dilemma for the eastside set netters.

               Let me know if you need more, DL.
