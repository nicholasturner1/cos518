            Subject : BOF draft ress release
            Delo is a o. Privileg we are waiting on. Mike and Mike want to talk to the governor one more time
            about Privilege

            The paragraph about the function of the board is the same one that was in the press release for Larry
            Edfeldt. Just a heads up incase you don 't want it the same word for word . Also, the last paragraph was
            changed by the governor . She wanted the region the prior board members were from , not the city. One
            more thing , she mentioned a quote saying all fishermen/gear groups/regions need to work together on
            this board . You may want to follow up with her on that.

            The governor is at Willow 's basket-ball game for the next hour or so , but should have her cell if things
            change.

            Thanks,
