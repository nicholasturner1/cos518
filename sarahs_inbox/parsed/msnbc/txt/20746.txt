           I received a phone call that was from a different citizen but said almost the same thing!
           Yes, I think we need to make Randy aware of what is being asked out there. Thanks, Janice

              Dear MrJMs. Ombudsman

              Very sad when I can do 20 min worth of Googling and call the Alaska OMB directly to get the complete story on
              this topic reported here

              h       vol         hinatonao   Go      e- ua   Q4 8109/02/oaiin   shed

              Mr. Kane doesn't put in context the Governors veto, but instead calls a first time $3 .9 million dollar capital
              contribution a slash . There was no prior year funding and since this is a one time item, there may not be any
              future funding of this capital program.

              Here's the back up on the original request

              SB 53 as signed had no funding for this program for the 2008 FY

              The current budget DOES and was signed by the Governor . Going from $0 to $3.9 is a SLASH? C'mon. Is that
              good journalism? No context? No comments from the people receiving the grant? No comments for someone in
              the gov office in Alaska? How lazy. It was easy for me , I Googled the Alaska OMB , dialed the number and bingo
              got to talk to someone who could confirm what I was seeing in SOURCE DOCUMENTS online. Gosh the Internet
              is amazing (THANKS AL Gore !) heheheh....

              If a woman sitting at a computer in Texas can ask the right questions and find the answers online , what does that
              tell you about the quality of reporting in this case?

              Is this symptomatic of what I read on your website? I presume Mr. Kane is not a blogger and that the quality and
              standards of what I read from him and the other writers/reporters under the banner of the WP meets the

               traditional standards of journalism, right?

               I guess the WP will now doing a story noting Palin's strong support for the expansion of the programs at Covenant
