              No prob at all, in the end. We certainly didn't need security, just a parking spot. Gary
              didn't respond very favorably about advising on the parking- no big deal tho cuz we're
              here now!

             I had assumed that this was taken care of. I should have checked to confirm. Gary asked me
             for details yesterday and I told him that Sharon was staffing and coordinating and that I
             didn't think security would be necessary at the event (since they have their own) but I
             wasn't thinking of parking and thought he'd ck w/sharon. I apologize for any
             inconvenience.

                We're at the iditarod start - we've been kicked out of the two parking spots we thought
              we could park in- did the invitors of this event tell anyone where we're supposed to park
              for this bill signing?

              Thanks.  It will be an intense, important week. I am home today and then headed to
              Anchorage tomorrow. Thanks for letting me be part of your team. Kay Cashman, Petroleum
              News, treated us well about the rumors.



              As soon as time allows it would.be good to review the town meetings - a real success.



              Have a great day!      God bless. Tom

              their discussion on gasline would lead to PTU discussion also. Thank you

               As you all know, the Point Thompson remand hearings will start next Monday 3rd and
              continue through Friday 7th from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm. To help in everyone's thinking: in
              my opening comments I will be stating that I will be interested in the proposed POD, how
              it compares to the previously denied POD, what makes this different, what are the
              protections in this 23rd POD that progress would be made, how can this POD be trusted with
              22 previous POD's, that I have not been influenced by the Governor or others, that the
              decision is solely mine and that I have the full responsibility to make the correct
              decision on the information provided.



               It will be an important week and I will have great support with Nan, Marty, the legal
              team, and our DOG technical team . Hope this update helps.   Tom
