 I think she's willing for National Review, Boston Herald, and Novak. However, when these things come
 to fruition I need the contact info for the specific folks who will interview so I can pass it on to our
 communications department and they can set something up. When you get me the names and deadlines,
 I'll set them up with Roseann Hughes and Sharon Leighow, our great press folks.

 And, thanks so much for your help! ! Think we can get something on your blog today?

            Holly,

            Do you think you could help shed some light on this issue? We're trying to get this
            out to as many websites, blogs, organizations as possible.

            Thanks,

           Ivy

             Friends,

             As you know, Lyda Green killed two abortion bills in the Senate
             a few weeks ago when she refused to allow the full Senate to
             vote on whether or not to waive it from the Senate Judiciary
             Committee. Lyda has voted in favor of pro-life/anti-abortion
             legislation since being elected in 1994. It's very disappointing
             she would set her personal beliefs aside, as well as those of the
             majority of her constituents, to favor "protocol."

             Now, Lyda wants to derail the gasline special session by
             expanding the call to include more bills because of her lack of
             leadership and inaction during regular session. It's absolutely
             unacceptable Lyda favors the will of her bi-partisan caucus over
             the will of her constituents.

             Governor Palin yesterday outlined her willingness to consider a
             separate special session to include the abortion bills Lyda killed
             in the Senate; however we ALL must join Gov Palin in calling on
             Lyda to show Alaskans a path to success.

             Governor Palin wholeheartedly believes the abortion bills are
             important enough to be handled independently, outside oil and
             gas deliberations. As we all know, Gov Palin is pro-life and has
             never once wavered in her belief in the sanctity of every human
             life.

             I'm humbly asking each of you to get on the Alaska Politics blog
             and counter some of the nasty, hateful, heartless and inaccurate
             comments that are on there. Also, if you can encourage anyone
             in your own email distribution lists to get on the blogs. We need
             to spread the word that Gov Palin is effectively and efficiently
             doing everything she can to build a gasline AND support
             important abortion legislation.

             Also, if you could write letters to the editor showing support for
             our governor it would be appreciated. I've attached the letter
             she sent to Lyda Green, as well as our media advisory that went
