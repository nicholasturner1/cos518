            Start - even in lean budget times - is a commitment to our

            children and an investment in our economic prosperity, and we

            cannot afford to pass up these opportunities.



            Thank you again for your leadership on this important issue. I

            hope I can continue to count on your support for Head Start in

            the future. Our children's future demands nothing less.



            Sincerely, Charles Freeman, M.A.
