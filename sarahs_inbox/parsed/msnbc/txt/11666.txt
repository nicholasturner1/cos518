                 Capital Notes
                www.alaskachamber.com                                      Tuesday January 29, 2008

                Legislature and Governor begin shortened (90 day) session in earnest
                The legislature just entered into its 14th day today with many committees operational in the first
                week of the second session of the 25th Alaska legislature. Finance subcommittees are already
                scheduling meetings hoping to complete early budget work for later deliberations. Realistically,
                there are only a few issues that are considered must pass for this year's legislature. Importantly,
                the legislature must pass an operating budget as directed by the constitution. The legislature
                should pass a capital budget, which helps correct and fund deferred maintenance backlogs and
                important transportation projects.

                Other issues worth noting that will likely consume much of this legislature are: PERS/TRS
                retirements, Constitutional Language allowing for long-term contracts between the state and a
                private entity, stockpiling budget surpluses in varying accounts, funding education on a two year
                cycle, and funding a municipal dividend.

                State of the State
                Governor Palin highlighted the state operating budget as her top priority in dealing with expected
                surpluses. The Governor believes $7 billion should be saved in the Constitutional Budget
                Reserve, in the corpus of the Permanent Fund, or by forward funding education and relieving
                debt for PERS/TRS. Likely, the legislature will have some input, as they are the only folks
                under the constitution allowed to make appropriations. The Governor will likely be forced to
                veto or negotiate heavily before any final budget crosses her desk.

                Gasline
                Currently, the state of Alaska has entered into negotiations with TransCanada, the only
                application acceptable under the AGIA (Alaska Gasline Inducement Act) process. As you recall,
                AGIA took up considerable time and energy during last year's legislative session.
                ConocoPhillips has also submitted an application for a natural gas pipeline project that falls
                outside of the AGIA guidelines. Here is where things get tricky. TransCanada's application is
                conditional on gaining access to Alaska's vast supplies of north-slope gas. ConocoPhillips, for

                                                                                                                   Page 2 of 4


                argument 's sake, has 1/3 of the gas, with BP and Exxon holding the remaining 2/3. As many in the
                legislature spelled out during the AGIA process, how do you get the folks who hold the gas to the
                gasline builder, and how does one private company pull their share of gas out of the ground when all of
                the gas is pooled together?

                All three companies suggest that a fixed taxable rate needs to be set before gas can be sold in the
                domestic markets. While the ConocoPhillips proposal includes a fixed taxable rate, the state
                constitution may need some tweaking to allow the proposal to move forward. Even with changes to
                existing law, ConocoPhillips is still sitting on the sidelines according to the AGIA process, and
                TransCanada has yet to prove that there is access to the gas. So where are we with two different
                administrations and roughly six years into the process? It appears there is no clear resolution in sight.

                HJR 27-Constitutional authority to enter into long-term natural gas contracts
                On the bright side, Rep Ralph Samuels and Rep. Jay Ramras have introduced HJR 27, a bill that would
                create a constitutional amendment to allow for the state and a private entity to enter into a long-term
                contract with regards to natural gas . When the previous administration had gone down this road, many
                folks cited the unconstitutionality of entering into a long-term contract and thus removing the
                legislature 's constitutional authority to tax. As you may already know, contracts for delivery of natural
                gas are generally sold on a long-term basis, 10-20 years into the future on average. This is the standard
                practice on the domestic and world natural gas markets. HJR 27 attempts to bring the state and the
                north-slope producers together to bring Alaska's gas to market. The bill is expected to be heard in the
                coming days in the House Judiciary Committee where timelines and specifics will be hotly debated.

                State Chamber Priorities
                Having adopted our top priorities this past fall, we are actively attempting to flesh them out during the
                legislative process. On the very top of the list, is the need for the state to adopt a fiscal plan. We still
                believe this is of the utmost importance for the future of the state. We have endorsed and reported on
                extensively last year, Rep. Mike Hawker's bill, HB 125. Amending Alaska Statutes regarding the
                Executive Budget Act, HB 125 assigns a long-term fiscal plan requirement to the Governor's duties of
                providing yearly budgets, with the plan looking out 10 years into the future.

                Fiscal Plan
                Last year, HB 125 was delayed in Senate Finance. After a few cordial meetings with Senator Stedman
                (co-chair of Senate Finance) and staff, we were told that the bill would be a priority next year. This year
                as promised, committee hearings on HB 125 began the first week. We expect more meetings in the
                future as details and concerns from other members are worked out. Sen. Fred Dyson and Sen.Gary
                Wilken also carry similar bills. A few of their ideas may have to be rolled into the final product.

                We look forward to the continued dialogue and are optimistic the legislature will put something into
                statute this year. With the Governor having to update and submit a long-term fiscal plan each year, we
                will finally have a moving target for the legislature and the public to use in order to achieve long-term
                fiscal stability.

                Other Issues
                There are many other issues we are working on including limited budget growth by using the FY06
                budget as a starting point and allowing for 3% growth only for consecutive years. Below please find a
                list of a few of the bills that we are researching, working with staff and legislators on, writing letters on
                and providing public testimony for. There are many issues facing Alaska's business community, far too
                many to list, but we are doing our best to stay out in front and represent business in Alaska.

                Upcoming Elections
                As is the norm in any second session of the Alaska Legislature, individuals begin vying for various seats
                while others look to new challenges. So is the latter case for Representative Mary Nelson of Bethel
                (District 38) and Sen. Gary Wilken of Fairbanks (District E), have both have publicly announced that
                they will not seek reelection this upcoming fall. We appreciate their willingness to serve the state of
                Alaska and we look forward to this last legislative session with them as members. Public service often
                garners little reward, but collects a great deal of criticism. The Alaska State Chamber of Commerce
                thanks them both for their public service these many years. !

                State Chamber of Commerce.
                While there are a number of issues the State Chamber is working on, if there is an issue that is important
                to you and your business, please let the folks at the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce know of your
                concerns.

                Following Legislation?
                Any person can follow the legislative process and access new bills, committee substitutes or determine
                which legislator is on a particular committee in the Legislative Bill Action and Status Inquiry System
                (BASIS). You can see what committee a bill is in, when it will be heard, how committee members
                voted, and much more. You can also view all bills relating to your specific areas of interest by selecting

                           American educators are, by and large, a passive bunch. Comes
                           the lashing over our alleged failures and we mostly take a "this,
                           too will pass," or an "I will work harder" attitude (the latter after
                           the horse in Animal Farm and we know what happened to him).
                           Educators were blamed for letting the Russians get into space
                           first (Eisenhower wanted them to do that), for the urban riots of
                           the 60's, for the SAT decline (mostly due to changes in the
                           demographics of who was taking the SAT), for letting us become
                           threatened by "a rising tide of mediocrity" and therefore "A
                           Nation at Risk." Lately myriad reports have exhorted teachers to
                           do more lest we be felled economically by China or India (enter
                           "Believing the Worst" and "Bracey" into Google to get a chronicle of th
                           that appeared in Stanford Magazine summer of 2006).

                           Well, right now we have a chance to blow some reality onto the fog of

                        mortgage debacle whose full scope even now is not yet known.

                        So far, no one has figured out how to lay this one on the schools although I'm sure
                        Bush and Spellings have Carl Rove locked in an office to construct some scenario for
                        blame. (The schools will likely be involved in some way . On Tuesday , January 22,
                        Bush appeared with Treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , and financial guru Charles
                        Schwab to announce the formation of an advisory committee on "financial literacy.")


                        In the meantime, when someone at a dinner party says , "You idiot educators have
                        really done it this time ," you have some comebacks:

                           1. Schools didn't produce the cheap credit which financed the housing bubble.
                               Cheap credit was available because we were borrowing $ 2 billion a day, mostly
                               from China (boy, if they ever cash in their chits...).
                          2. Greenspan kept rates low as a matter of policy and denied the existence of the
                               bubble (just some "froth").
                          3. Unchecked Financial "Innovation ." Shoddy products such as "Collateralized
                               Debt Obligations " and "Structured Investment Vehicles" were packaged by
                               banks and sold on Wall Street, and not by high schoolers trying to raise money
                              for their class trip.
                          4. The ratings agencies -Standard & Poor's , Moody's, etc .-were asleep at the
                              wheel. At best. They might have known all along what was happening but
                              looked the other way or winked in order to maintain good relations with the
                              banks Issuing the garbage noted in #3. Because of this, not only has personal
                              credit tightened , but banks are skittish about lending to each other because
                              they don't know how much of an institution is just a straw house.
                          5. Predatory lending . American high schoolers might be middling at math, but I
                              bet most of them would have seen the flaw in a dominant sales strategy:
                              Home values will rise forever! So it doesn 't matter what the terms of the loan
                              are because you're sure to get rich from rising equity and prices. I am not a
                              mortgage maven , but I'm not a novice either , but when one outfit offered me
                              one of these interest-only-option deals , it took some very close reading of the
                              fine print to see that I would be in a negative amortization situation (the
                              principal of my loan would grow over time; I would owe more money than I
                              borrowed) and that the interest rate could jump from 5.5% to 10. 5% in a
                              single year. No thanks.

                       In the meantime, the military wants to expand by 92,000 troops with an estimated
                       annual cost of $1.2 billion per 10,000. As of 2005 the Pentagon' s Base Structure
                       Report-the government's own official count--listed 737 bases around the world not
                       counting those in Kosovo, Israel, Kyrgistan, Qatar, Uzbekistan or Iraq (106 by
                       itself). Some peace-loving nation, huh? At the height of their power, the Roman
                       Empire in 117 A. D. had 37 bases, Great Britain in 1898, 36. And, of course, the
                       Pentagon's list doesn't include "black" sites.

                       So, educators , take the initiative (but don't be "pro-active," perhaps the ugliest
                       word in the English language ). Show people what 's happening in Japan and Hong
                       Kong and other nations where high scores allegedly produce prosperity . You might
                       remind anyone you're speaking with that in the 1990 's once the Japanese

                Very, very disappointing, but also seems to be par for the course : too many "disclosures "/leaks that only aim to
                undermine this effort . This is unacceptable.

                Joe· pis find out everything you can on this. It's unacceptable. Please enlist whomever else you must in order to find
                out who leaked... because it must, and will, stop.

                John, if you can find out anything, please do. Who attended the meetings?

                My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting obviously provided it. I don't like
                that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the relationship we hope to have with the delegation.

                In our debrief with the gas team afterwards, we discussed each DC meeting and what, if anything, we need to do.
                We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to
                review the facts, and I have requested this but have not heard back.

                Senator Stevens is adamant (and probably so is Senator Murkowski). In our collective opinion, we need to continue
                to educate and inform, not cut off communications.

                Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If there is activity, it will be at
                FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the only game in town, and I believe that the delegation
                understands that.

                Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and hopefully that dialogue will
                help. The next big DC event is FERC's next report to Congress on the gasline. Collectively, I believe we've done
                everything we can to help FERC understand the current situation.

                Because of the importance of your question, I'm taking the liberty of adding the Governor to our email exchange.

                P.S.
                On a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well. The participants were interested and receptive.

                Jan 30 : Mr. AQIA goes to Washington

                Last week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update back to Alaska's Congressional
                delegation.
                With a year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford
                ran head first into two skeptical Alaska Senators.
                In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski , Irwin and Rutherford encountered Senators
                unwilling to accept their sales pitch . Both Stevens and Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.
                Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford , " You're not listening and you didn' t listen last time."
                And, at one point, Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of AGIA and said, " Don't philosophize
                with me."
                As'a friend of mine pointed out, its great political theater but it doesn 't build a pipeline.
