           Dear Sarah,



           Congratulation's on your beautiful little boy. It was so wonderful to read about you and
           your husband wanting to bring your son into this world even though you knew he was going
           to have a rough road ahead. My son has Down Snydrome and he is such a joy and blessing.
           Once again, congratulation's and enjoy your bundle of joy!
