             Subject: Judge Interviews


           Just so you know all of the nominations have asked for in-person interviews . I said (because of the governor's
           busy schedule right now) that we have time set aside for teleconference until I hear otherwise . Perhaps in the
           future, at least for Superior Court , the governor could interview the top candidates ? Something to think about, I
           guess.

           Sharon Illsley, who's applying for KNI District , was the only nomination who actually conveyed she was
           appreciative of having the governor participate in the teleconference . She said she understands how busy the
           governor is-I was appreciative of that. Sharon is endorsed by Chuck Kopp and Kevin Clarkson (an attorney
           friend of Lt. Governor Parnell).
