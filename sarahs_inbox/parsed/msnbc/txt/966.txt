MESSAGE:

Sarah,



Congratulations to and your family on the pending arrival of little Palin. I have always been
impressed at how you manage the state, but still make your family a priority. Being a working mother
is difficult for anyone, let alone the governor of a state. You truly do a terrific job, and all of us
working women and Moms are here to support you. Again, Congratulations Sarah!
