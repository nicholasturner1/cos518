              lpm is too late. Really, to not have control over these mtgs is getting annoying and
              cumbersome re: my own schedule.

              We need to wrap up supplemental decision so I can follow through on my committment to
            give lawmakers plenty of time to figure out how to plug their vetoed projects into capital
            budget. Today's my last day mtg with them- we need to act tonight or tomorrow. And
            press/Alaskans need to hear a powerful message , via seeing Mike's list, of how screwy this
            has gotten under Bert. We need to be adament about this.

                Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill

                McAllister, Stephen M., Kristina?? On the second floor about the capital

                budget - told them there are significant items missing that are basic

                health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some examples

                like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big

                differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED

                grants - approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly

                there has to be a responsible budget by the end and that we will

                continue to work toward that.



                They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental -

                told them we still have a few more meetings with legislators - that I

                didn't think we would be able to do much before Thursday -

                We need to do it sooner . Senate just had their press avail and we can't

                let their issues go unanswered for another two days . Mike and I are

                working on it.

                I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

               could cover budget items as well as CON.

                screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

                to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

                outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

               pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
