               Subject: Manchin/Palin Letter to Congress




               Attached for your files is the final version of the Governors Manchin/Palin letter to
               Congress concerning funding for PILT and Secure Rural Schools.



               Sharon, this letter might make for a good press release on a slow news day. In
               particular, communities in Southeast are quite dependent on funding under the Secure Rural
               Schools program and have expressed their support in the past. In addition, PILT helps
               compensate communities located on federal lands administered by the BLM for the inability
               of such communities to impose taxes.



               If you need further information, please let Sam or me know.
