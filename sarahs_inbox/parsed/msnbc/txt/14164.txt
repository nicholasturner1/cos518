               Governor:
               It appears SB 125 is due to be signed today or become law without your signature. I
               had hoped that Gina Ragle from Law and the folks in our Division of Retirement 8s
               Benefits could be present when you signed it. I don't know if that's still possible, but
               if it is, please let me know and I would gather them and send them your way. Thank
               you for your consideration.
