Todd,



I'll let them know and see what their time frame is for the PSA.



 Tomorrow I have a meeting with the contractors, engineers and project managers for the second
phase of the plumbing project. I requested this meeting so they would give us a schedule and we'd
know the impact to the House this summer. I'll send you the information so you and the Governor
can have input for the proposed schedules.



Thanks,

Erika

 Hi Todd,



 How would you like me to handle the PSA for the Alaska Trails ATV Safety Project? They asked if
you were available the week of January 28 - February 1st . I hadn't heard back from you in regards to
the dates , so was checking to see if you had spoken directly to them.



PSA INFORMATION:

One day film shoot- Best dates available for filming are January 28th, 29th, February 5th or 6th.




 * Big Lake or Wasilla would be great for filming. If there is a particular place that Todd will be or
recommends, please let us know.




                                                     2                                ROSTON 01451




 Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
* Is there a friend / racing partner that would like to be in the shoot as well? Family members are
most welcome, as well. If Governor Palin or the kids wanted to be in one scene, they could be
written into the script. It's Todd's choice.




 Thanks,

 Erika

Hi Erika-



 I met with the creative director & production manager today of the film crew for the PSA. I wanted to
share some information and questions they passed to me.




* It still will only be a one day film shoot. Best dates available for filming are January 28th, 29th,
February 5th or 6th.

Hello Jillian,



 I have emailed the second set of dates to Mr. Palin and I'm sure that I'll here back from him when he
returns, as he is currently traveling outside the state.



Don't hesitate to call or email if you'd like to follow up on this ; it's not a bother.
