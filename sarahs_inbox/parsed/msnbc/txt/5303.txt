              Chuck left several messages on my work phone over the weekend. In the

               last one, he said that the Governor had called him and has designated

               staff to receive his future calls. He sounded quite happy.



              Because of the DC relevance, I will stay in touch with him as well.

               Chuck Hamel has been calling nonstop to try and get an appointment with

              you while you are in DC. He says he has important FBI information about

               corruption at Prudhoe Bay that you need to know about. I have asked

               both Joe Balash and Meg Stapleton to call him. John Bitney recommends

              you do not talk to him directly, that one of your staff should. John

              wants somebody from the staff to find out what he's calling about so he

               doesn't spring something on you. He knows you are in DC for NGA so he

              may try to run into you somewhere, he is very adamant about talking

              directly to you.
