             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations upon the birth of your baby boy, Trig Paxson van Palin! while other people
             focus on what they see as a negative--Down Syndrome--we are delighted that you are
             focusing on the positive.




             Our fourth child, a daughter, was born in 1978 affected by Down Syndrome. Like you, we
             were told the negatives by most physicians. Fortunately, one said: "Take her home a love
             her, she will be a blessing!"



             How true! Indeed, when she was two we adopted a baby boy at birth who is also affected by
             Down Syndrome. So we are doubly blessed! As we heard many years ago: "All of us are
             handicapped, some handicaps just show more than others."



             You have already blessed your son by letting him have a life. You will be blessed in more
             ways than you can imagine, on this earth and beyond.



             God bless you both,



             Bob & Beverly Freeman
