            Subject: Phone message for Gov re: Ron Paul's Presidential Campaign (contact: Christian
            Piccolo)

            Importance: High



            Janice / Kris - Last Friday afternoon, I received a phone call from Christian Piccolo who
            would love to speak to the Governor if she would like to hear about Ron Paul's
            presidential campaign.  Since Governor Palin had minimum support for the Republican Party
            during her campaigning, he believes that she would be a great supporter for Ron Paul as he
            is facing similar issues running for president. He stated that 5 minutes is all the time
            he would need and he would inform the Governor of "who is Ron Paul."



            Following are some of the goals/visions of Ron Paul that Christian stated off hand:




                                                                   I




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0010877

             He wants to.-



                             - bring ALL troops home (globally)

                             - reduce the size of the Federal Government

                             - eliminate, the Department of Education

                             - eliminate homeland security

                             - eliminate illegal immigration

                             - give back to American ' s % of what they make     ( re: income taxes)



             I believe that Christian is part of Ron Paul ' s campaign committee and he said that he will
             gladly speak with anyone at any time and any day .       His cell phone number is ( 608) 728-2341
             and he has a website for more information which is www . ronpaulchat.net
             <www.ronpaulchat . net> <http :// www.ronpaulchat . net/ <http :// www.ronpaulchat . net/> >



            I personally don't know if Governor Palin would choose to support Ron Paul , but she may be
            willing to listen to what he has to say . Christian would be greatly appreciated if anyone
            would call - just to receive 5 more minutes of information . Do either of you have any
            suggestions on how to handle this? would she call him?



            Let me know if I can do anything else with this .         Thanks !   Hannah
