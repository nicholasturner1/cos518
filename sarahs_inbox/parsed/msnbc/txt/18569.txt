             Dr. Tomera was removed from the medical board effective Wednesday , September 5t'.

             We consulted with Dave Jones about options , and consequently asked for Tomera's resignation again through his
             attorney. Our request in writing had a deadline of September 4t'. We did not hear from Tomera's Attorney in the
             timeframe given , and sent the removal letter after a day of leeway. While the letter was in transit , Tomera's
             attorney contacted us saying Tomera would resign , however no letter was sent . They eventually received the
             letter of removal and contacted us back that essentially the removal letter was sufficient.

             We are now on a search to fill that seat as well . The ED of the Board says that ideal candidate would be either a
             psychiatrist or an anesthesiologist . We may have a psychiatrist candidate , and will be checking in the
             anesthesiology arena as well.

             Dan has put together an excellent chronology of facts which we 'll keep in case it is needed down the road.
