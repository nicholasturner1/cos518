            Thanks much. That's a fine sign if Harris has heartburn over this. And we'll remind folks
            it's the leggies who set precedent w/sp session location last year after their internal
            "polls" asking for Juneau locale... and their committment to having conference/public
            hearings on the road system. (Which they didn't do but have said they'll do this time.)
            Thanks

            Sharon and I have made the corrections and we can get that to you first

            thing this morning.



           We touched bases with Coghill, Harris, French, Therriault, and Stoltze.

           Harris was the only stick-in-the-mud. He wants tax-free per diem if

           he's going to do any work. I think Bill Mac has a blog entry on that

           particular statement.       Stoltze was disappointed that the whole thing

           won't be in Southcentral, but he agreed that we are giving folks plenty

           of notice and that is a good thing for those who have to raise money for

           their campaigns.      Tibbles talked to French and the reaction was

           reportedly good. Therriault also seemed fine.


                                                                  1




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01_0014214
