MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin,

You are our greatest natural resource. I just wanted to wish you well with your new family addition.

I have a friend in California who loves the 'governator' so I had to send a little dig to her. I told her to
see if her governor can match this.

"My Governor is better than your Governor."

Keep up the good work. You have made us proud to be Alaskans again.

Thanks ever so much,

God Bless
