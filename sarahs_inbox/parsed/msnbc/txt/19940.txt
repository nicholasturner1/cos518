           Pis have Joe answer Loy on the email blast story. I have no answers re: AGIA team's. blast
           without my knowledge that it was coming. I'd hate to put words in their mouth on this one
           so press needs to go directly to AGIA team on it.

               What time is saturday's energy speech in Juneau?
               It's too late now for me to rearrange again the kids travel back to Juneau with me today so
               hopefully I can work on that for the next couple of days so they can join me in Juneau soon. I
               had not known that there were numerous opportunities to have them participate this week in any
               First Family events.
               Pls sched that pre-school reading visit, Spouses Tea that should include First Family as hosts,
               etc. That should suffice for their trip back to the Gov's House during the end of this special
               session to join me in Juneau.
               I don't know if I'll have time to tour the ship tonight as I'll not be arriving at the office until late
               afternoon.
               Pls check on king air for August. Thanks

              Governor,
              The Senate schedule is very uncertain and will not firm up until after the Senate has their caucus meeting on Monday
              morning (@ 11:00am, I'm told). Therefore I think whatever date works for you for your Cabinet meeting will be fine. I do
              want to reiterate the message Tom sent to you last night, that we do need you here in Juneau early next week to start working
              Legislators before the. AGIA vote. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do for you.
              Thanks for checking on the schedule.
              Marty

              the visit into a cabinet meeting luncheon. Does Thursday sound good? Or before that?

              today!
                Mike - let's plan cabinet mtg in the form of a luncheon at the house this week, if we can assume enough members can be in
              Juneau. It's a historic week if the AGIA vote is taken, so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that (and in support of AGIA
              team). We can do a bit of an informal lunch w/roundtable setting and we'll literally go around the tables getting updates from
              everyone of their dept activities.
