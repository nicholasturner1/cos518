             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,



             I heard the story of your son Trig on the Glenn Beck television show this evening.
             Although we did not know that my son would have special needs prior to his birth we are
             immersed in tryig to help him overcome them. It has required that my family move to
             escape certain state educational systems but has resulted in his admission to a wonderful
             school in Hattiesburg Mississippi, the Dubard School for Speech and Language Disorders.
             In four months our son went from not talking to saying his first sentence.



             So many times people assume that a child's disorder is due to "the sin of the parent". It
             is refreshing to read the story of Trig. I look forward to following his development via
             the Web.



             From one blessed parent to another, thank you for your amazing story.
