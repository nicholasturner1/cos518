   Importance: High
  The Governor is agreeable to this plan if we can get Todd and the 3 girls from Bethel to Juneau on
  Sunday (AK Flight #44 Bethel to Anch-AK #70 Anch/Jno). She would fly Bethel to Fbx on Sunday, April
  1, RON Fbx--spend Monday, April 2, going on the King Air Fbx-Barrow-Fbx-Jno. Gary, Fred, Shane and
  Tom, will this work? it looks like Commissioner Irwin, another gasline team member, Andy Mills, would go
  with her to Barrow.

  Subject : Governor's Schedule

  I know that the Governor will be in Bethel on Sunday for a dance festival and the town hall
  meeting. We're also going to schedule a town hall meeting in Barrow on Monday or Tuesday
  and a Michael Dukes recording in Fairbanks on one of those days, too. Commissioner Tom
  Irwin will be there. The Governor would like to be at one or both depending on her
  schedule. She says that she shows Governor Sheffield is on her schedule for Monday. Is it
  possible to move that meeting? Could the King Air then take the Governor to Fairbanks on
  Sunday and then have the King Air take the Governor, Commissioner Irwin, another gasline
  team member, Andy Mills, Steve Quinn (possible?) to Barrow in the morning, do a town
  meeting, turn around and then a radio interview in Fairbanks at 4:00pm Monday afternoon?
  The Governor says she prefers to do it all in one day though we could separate the days.
  She says the meeting with Congressman Young could slide a day perhaps, too?

  Thanks for your help. Hope you had a nice day off!
