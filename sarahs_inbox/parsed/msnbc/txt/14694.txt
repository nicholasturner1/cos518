             We've not done this before - signing ceremonial after the fact. We've ceremonially signed
             BEFORE we had the bill in hand, but isn't this an odd way of doing this? Kinda' double-
             dipping after the previous ceremony where the Bethel students participated with the
             lawmakers already?
