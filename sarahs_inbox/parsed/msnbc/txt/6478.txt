       MESSAGE:

       Madam Governor, I want to thank you for being there for our Fallen Commrade and Sky
       Soldier PFC Jesse Rogers. I got a call from Command Sergeant Major Gunter who was also
       there. He said you presented the family with a state flag. That was great of you. I live
       in Fayetteville, North Carolina now but I still have some very strong ties up there. I
       started the Farthest North Chapter XII of the 173rd Airborne Brigade up there back in
       1988. When I left there in 1992 the chapter slowly faded away. I'm trying to get mr.
       Joseph Fields in fairbanks to head up the chapter with the help of CSM Gunter in Fort
       Rich. It looks like you really have some strong ties with the Vets up there. Thanks for
       that! I will keep you posted about the Chapter. rnrnYou may not know this, but we have a
       reunion in a different state every year. This year we were in Rochester, Minnasota. Last
       year we were here in North Carolina. The year before that we were in Austraila Next year
       2008 the association has decid!

      ed it's time to head North to Alaska. I am trying to come up with a meet and greet at one
      of the stops during the 7 day Alaskian Cruise. If you get a chance could you please look
      at our web site www.skysoldier.org and click on the Alaskian Cruise link and take a look
      at the schedule. I'm open to any suggestions you might have for the trip. The planned
      stops are Wednesday 28 May is Juneau from 0700 till 2000, Thursday 29 May is Sitka from
      0800 till 1700. Friday 30 May is Ketchikan 0700-1300hrs Reception/Awards ceremony 1800
      hours (Show Room), Captain's Cocktail 1915-2000, Banquet Dinner 2000 (Lower Floor) -
      FORMAL: Jacket &amp; Tie or Uniform: No Blue Jeans/ Short or T Shirts. rnrnIf memory
      serves me right your office is in Juneau. It would be great if we could have you as a
      guest for the first day to welcome the Sky Soldiers to Alaska or the last day rnto attend
      the banquet dinner and fly back to Alaska the next day. We could probably get you a room
      for one evening on the !

      ship if you were willing to visit.rnrnAs you can see I'm alre!
