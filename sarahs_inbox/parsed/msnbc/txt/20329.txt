          How long does the teachers' merit pay pilot program last? We inherited it from last admin,
          my understanding is it goes away and we can figure out something better on our own watch
          once the pilot program ends? There may need to be some clarification on the issue and the
          program's intent (based on emails I'm getting re: whatever was printed in the ADN on the
          issue today - I haven't read the article yet).
