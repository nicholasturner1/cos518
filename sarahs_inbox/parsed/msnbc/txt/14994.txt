            No, I did not know it ended up in Elton' s hands. Which email was it? How in the world did
            it get leaked?

            Governor as you already know the e mail you sent me on juneau access which I forwarded to
            mal menzies has ended up with sen elton and printed in his newsletter.
                                        We are trying to find out what happened but somebody has
            really jumped-off the deep end here and I am going to do my best to find out what happen.
            It goes without saying I feel terrible about the situation. Leo
