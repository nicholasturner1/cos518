        I can cover it in my 2pm interview,            but a press statement to all could help the issue
        also.

        I think it's a great idea - the public outcry is evident. Most can point to

        this one as nothing more than gamesmanship that will cost Alaskans dearly.

          Reading the ADN editorial today, and Quinn's story with the Governor's

          quotes, renewed my outrage over the stall on SB 80, the PPT corrosion bill.



           I wonder if we should hold a press conference reminding folks that the bill

          is only 4 pages, it only adds 12 lines of text to the statutes. It is not

          complicated!     It will keep the state from having to pay up to 52% of the

          replacement costs for poorly maintained facilities, it CAN be passed in one

          day if the House passes the Senate version.

         Meg:     Totally agree with both your points here.



         Talis:

         My challenge on these points is working so closley with many who were close

         to the ppt issue and because they have so much on their plates they don't

          seem as enthused about digging deep - and they may enjoy working in the

          isolation provided by Juneau more than i do (to me, this isolated

         environment seems unfair to the rest of concerned Alaskans).



         Ppt investigation is hugely important and i need objective minds delving

         into it - we need new blood taking a look at this issue. We need the

         independent investigation.

         Its a challenge - getting to the bottom of ppt vs gross has to be tackled.

         I am a vote for independent auditors / investigators. It is important,

         especially with due caution that the process and the vote were influenced.




         Additionally,     Sharon mentioned your thought of Anchorage for the special

         session - I can't imagine a better place .     Perhaps the close proximity to

         more of the people in this state will help to minimize undue influence.

         We need folks to get together soon to strategize on PPT revisitation. Via

         teleconf . or email exchanges ,       or in person , we need to hustle on formulating

         plan to reassure public that we're on it.




         Included in this discussion needs to be PPT rate ,           PPT vs Gross, any

         violation of state laws in process of adoption of PPT last yr., etc.

         Thank you.




         Please be thinking about this ,       and consider my request to have independent

         auditors / investigators help us tackle this monumental issue.




         I will be responding to legislators in their request for special session on

         PPT soon . Want to make sure we're all on same page before responding to

         their call for my attention given to the idea of PPT Special Session. (BTW,

         I'm game for session on this in the fall if need be.)
