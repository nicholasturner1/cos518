             Subject:                 Ayers


             Is it possible to get hooked up (maybe by Nick Ayers?) with someone from the McCain
             campaign? Let them know my relationship w/the state party (McCain goes through the same
             thing on Nat'l level), so party will never hook me up as the could have/should have to
             speak to candidates before Super Tuesday.



             I want to talk to McCain's people about his ANWR and resources positions.



             Let them know AK participates on Feb 5.



             I should talk to Huck's people too.



             Normally a Gov is asked to weigh in via state party leadership. Obviously we'll have to do
             this ourselves at the last minute.



             Ivy- would you contact my brother re: delegates, how it works... Off-the-clock of
             course... I didn't have the answers for him re: how process works to get delegates to Natl
             Convention.




             And if I ' m asked to speak at any convention , I only will if I get to put together a
             candid , blunt " change your ways , GOP" speech that demands changes in leadership or folks
             are going to bail.
