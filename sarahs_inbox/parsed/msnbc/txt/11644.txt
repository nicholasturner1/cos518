            The point that he puts the comments in quotations is really disturbing . Either someone
            kept copius not and gave them to him , or he again is attributing quotes inappropriately
            and unethically ... and needs to be called on it.

            I wasn ' t at the meeting, but Halcro ' s account contains some of the same snippets that were
            reported to me by the team.

              There were 11 people in the meeting. For the State, they were Marty, Tom, Pat, and
             Larry. .



              Then, there were Senator Stevens and three of his staff: George Lowe (Chief of Staff),
             Kate Williams (Legislative Director), and Kevin Simpson (Energy).  Also present were
             Senator Murkowski and two of her staff:  Isaac Edwards (Legislative Director) and Chuck
             Kleeschulte (Energy).



              I can't figure out how Halcro got the information and don't know of any way to check at
             this end.  Senator Stevens has always insisted on the confidentiality of such meetings and
             that has been respected by all concerned.



              We've spent part of this morning correcting some inaccurate information that came out of
             the meeting from the Senate side.

               My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
              obviously provided it. I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
              relationship we hope to have with the delegation.



              In our debrief with the gas team afterwards, we discussed each DC meeting and what, if
             anything, we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
             meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts, and I have requested
             this but have not heard back.



              Senator Stevens is adamant (and probably so is Senator Murkowski). In our collective
             opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform, not cut off communications.



              Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If there
             is activity, it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the only
             game in town, and I believe that the delegation understands that.



              Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
             hopefully that dialogue will help.   The next big DC event is FERC's next report to
             Congress on the gasline. Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
             FERC understand the current situation.



              Because of the importance of your question,       I'm taking the liberty of adding the Governor
             to our email exchange.



              P.S.

              On a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well. The participants
             were interested and receptive.

              Jan 30 :   Mr. AGIA goes to Washington




              Last week , the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update back
             to Alaska ' s Congressional delegation.

              With a year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR Deputy
             Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska Senators.

              In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski , Irwin and
             Rutherford encountered Senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both Stevens and
             Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.

              Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't listen
             last time."

              And, at one point , Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
             AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."

              As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
             pipeline.
