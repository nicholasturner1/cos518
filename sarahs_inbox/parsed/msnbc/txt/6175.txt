        Yikes!!  Who would've thunk!  Anyhow, I'll be praying for you- for the right person to
        replace him- as wise council is always a good thing.

        Bitney and Deb. Still can't believe it - and hope its not true about the two of them
        together at the mansion when I let Deb stay there while I was gone. Ugh. I sure learned a
        lesson there!

        Hello,

        I'm checking into it and will let you know. If we don't have an account established is
       AK Cleaners the most convenient since they have the two locations?

         Sorry to hear about Bitney.

          Hi E: do we have a contract with Alaska Cleaners - or who is it with? I'll be dropping
         off dry cleaning soon and don't want to wait to get back to juneau to do so. There's an Ak
         Cleaners in wasilla and Anchorage do that would be convenient.
