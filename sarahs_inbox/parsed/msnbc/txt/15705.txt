           Kenai LNG Export License Approved



           June 3, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today lauded the decision by the U.S.
           Energy Department to approve the application of Marathon Oil Corporation and
           ConocoPhillips for an extension of the Kenai LNG export license. The two companies filed
           for the extension in January 2007.



           "In these times of economic uncertainty, this is great news for the state and its
           residents," Governor Palin said. "This extension helps secure a future for the LNG
           operation and is another step toward ensuring energy supplies and energy security for
           Alaska."



           In January, the state of Alaska and the owners of the LNG plant reached an agreement that
           ensured there will be adequate supplies of gas for local utilities. The agreement also
           required the owners to develop additional natural gas reserves in Cook Inlet and allow
           third parties the opportunity to monetize their gas production through the LNG plant.
            Marathon and ConocoPhillips have also agreed to sell Cook Inlet seismic and well data to
           third parties.



           The Kenai LNG facility, located in Nikiski, is the only LNG export plant in North America..
           The facility initiated operations in 1969 and today employs 58 people; the plant also
           supports 128 other jobs in the Kenai community. In addition, the operations of the plant
           contribute approximately $50 million in royalties and taxes to the state and local
           economies.
