          Good morning Governor - we are receiving responses from the departments

          to their review of the capital budget - not a lot of specific

          recommendations for vetoes but some general comments. My staff is

          following up with the agencies and asking additional questions so that

          we have sufficient information to base our recommendations to you on. I

          expect to have the Department of Law's review sometime next week.



          I expect Legislators will be reluctant to put anything specific in

          writing - those with specific ideas are more likely to pick up the phone

          and call Mike, John, or me - As you can expect, I am getting more calls

          from people concerned about their projects being removed from the budget

          than from those asking for us to veto! I will talk with Mike and John

          about how best to engage legislators in the process.



          Karen

         John : i was asked yest by reporters what percentage         ( budget cuts) we're

         aiming for - didn't have a specific number but declared we would be

         vetoing .    It occurred to me we need to enlist the help of legislators,

         esp those who came out of the session screaming that their colleagues

          spent too much money.

         We'll give them the opportunity to help the state.



         Would you figure out how to reach out to them in requesting their ideas

         on cuts - some line items are in districts where the local legislator

         did not even request the item, it appears . They need to give input on

         where we can afford to cut, delay funding, or phase in funding . We need

         to do this asap.



         Perhaps a letter from the third floor giving them a head ' s up reminder

         that we must live within our means and a strong request to           tell us how

         they can help.



         I know it's probably never been done before , but so be it. But it's got

         to be done soon.



         Also, I'm very anxious to hear from Cabinet members their suggestions

         for cuts ,   too. Mike - would you forward this to Commissioners as the

         reminder that we need their input asap.



         Thanks!
