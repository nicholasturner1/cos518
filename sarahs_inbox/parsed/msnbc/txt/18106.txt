       Governor,



       1  I followed up with Griz yesterday. He says he has known you for 15 years, that you
       guys worked together on the city fireworks display, and that he was endorsing you in Nome
       during the campaign.  All of this may, or may not be the case. He does however want to be
       plugged in.  He said he believes in you and what you stand for. I went through some of
       the more low key vacancies with him.
