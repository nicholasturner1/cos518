             MESSAGE:

             Hello Governor Palin,

             I read about your new baby and you set a great example to the women of our country. I am
             a single, divorced 41 year old Mom of four and I am in nursing school with a year to
             graduate.  I love my children and I want to give them a life they deserve. It makes me so
             happy to see somebody like you with a beautiful family who says "I can do it! Watch me."
             I wish you the best of luck in the future with your son, and he is just perfect!

             Best Wishes!

             Robin Barrett
