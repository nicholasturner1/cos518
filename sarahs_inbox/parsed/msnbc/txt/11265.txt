                 Subject: Seaton and community dividend proposal

               Just a heads up that Rep. Seaton came to see me yesterday with his Community Dividend
               Proposal . He's going to introduce soon if he hasn 't already. Basically, he wants to take 1.5
               billion of this year's surplus and set it aside in a special account of the Perm Fund (Amerada
               Hess was) and spin off 5% of the interest as a dividend to communities.

              I listened and had a discussion with him about how the surplus will generate lots of ideas about
              how to save and spend it. We discussed how there 's going to have to be a process whereby
              the governor and legislature have the opportunity to set these priorities together via legislation,
              budgets, etc. I also pointed to the governor 's proposals for sustainable funding of priorities like
              the transportation/infrastructure fund and the alternative energy fund . I didn't provide any
              comment one way or other about his proposal , just listened and took it in. Just for your FYI.
