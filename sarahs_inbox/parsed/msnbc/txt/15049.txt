            FYI.  PSIO will be monitoring the situation on the ground . I'll try to get an estimate on
            what this might mean for our production forecast numbers. I don't think a one day shut-
            down will have a big impact, but I'll check.

            I just received a phone call from Tony Brock with BP notifying me that the Prudhoe Bay
            field is currently shut down. Deadhorse has had phase 2 and 3 weather conditions with a
            lot of snow . BP believes that an airline for the fuel gas system ruptured, which resulted
            in the power plant shutting down, and eventually the entire field (approximate time 12:30
            am today).



            BP has currently re-established fuel to the power system and is in the process of starting
            the power plant now. Tony does not have any indication of how long it will take for
            everything to be back on-line but will provide me with an update and schedule this
            afternoon.




            Important notes - there were no injuries , BP does not believe there were any spills, and
            all equipment functioned properly, including emergency facilities.



            Let me know if I have forgotten anyone or if you have questions /want more information. I
            will send an update as soon as I hear back from Tony.
