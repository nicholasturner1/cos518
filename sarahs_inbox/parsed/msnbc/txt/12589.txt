            Rosemary Shinohara of the ADN just left me a voice mail asking for certain information
            about our earmarks. She was not there when I returned her call.



            I will provide the information she wants. But, it also occurred to me that she might
            benefit from the perspectives contained in the Governor ' s proposed op-ed piece to the
            Fairbanks News - Miner . I said in my return message that I could provide the specific
            information she wanted but that she should contact you to see if there was something more
            we could provide.




            Please note that my email address has changed . My new email address is
            <mailto : jwkatz @alaskadc . org> jwkatz@alaskadc . org. Thank you .
