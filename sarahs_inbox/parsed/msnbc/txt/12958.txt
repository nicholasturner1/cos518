              Subject: Draft of Sen. Dyson's Letter to the Editor




             Governor:



             I am checking with     DOT on the project Sen. Dyson complains about. If I recall earlier
             conversations with     John MacKinnon on the subject, DOT made some changes to the project
             that followed Sen.     Dyson's intent language but did not modify the project in every way
             that he requested.     It will probably be tomorrow before I can get to the bottom of this.



             I do not think his complaint about the AG has any merit. He complains that DOT did not
             follow his intent language on the project in budget bills. I believe the Constition
             (Confinement Clause) and Alaska Supreme court cases limit the legislature's use of intent
             language to restrict actions of the Executive Branch.
