         If the plan is to give Ron until the end of the year to retire, I can talk to Emil and the
         other commissioners on the board (Galvin and Von Scheben) to get things back on track.

         I'll get with Emil on it.



         Mike have you seen this? Or already talked to Emil on it?



         Thanks for passing it along to me Pat.
