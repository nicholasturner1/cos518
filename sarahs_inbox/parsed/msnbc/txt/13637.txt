           Mike- whaddya think. Very low key is my desire, no one knows when it'll wrap up. I've got
           ktva at 5pm. Nothing formal and stiff from us.

           Governor, have you thought about what you would like to do for an

           end-of-session wrap-up? We could have a press availability in the

           conference room if they gavel out on the earlier side, but if it's late

           tonight and you have an early morning flight you might not want to do

           that. Last year I believe you did an end-of-session press conference the

           following day. Please advise and we stand ready to make it happen.
