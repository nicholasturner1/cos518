             Governor,

             We are not announcing when the Commissioner will issue the decision on the PTU Remand
             Hearing . However it is fair to tell them that Superior Crt Judge Gleason has required we
             file a decision with her by June 15th.



            Regarding the questions you will receive on AGIA, we are working on the Special Session
            Proclamation and draft press release, which will be to you and Sharon by the end of the
            day.  Perhaps you could simply tell the press they will be hearing something specific from
            you by the end of the week.

             Thanks,

            Marty

            Thank you Marty.

            Are we estimating a timeline yet on announcing DNR finding?

            And Tibbles was stopped again today by McAllister asking about AGIA timing... just fyi...
            he (and other reporters ) will be attending one of my legislative budget meetings this
            afternoon so he 'll be asking me again about timing of special session and he 'll want me to
            answer his "what's up with AGIA" standard questions.

                     Governor, All,

                  I am forwarding this exchange between Robert Dillon and Cammy Taylor (DNB's Oil &
            Gas Division) just so you know the correct information. The Wesley Loy' article in
            today's Anch Daily News inaccurately stated that ExxonMobil's proposal was filed with the
            Superior Crt.   It was simply filed with DNR as part of the PTU Remand Hearing.

            Final Judgment and Order" filed with the DNR Commissioner Friday 3/21.   These documents
            were filed for the Commissioner's consideration only. They were not filed with the
            Superior Court.

                   Marty,



                  Can we talk sometime this morning about what ' s happening in the Point Thomson case?
            Wesley ' s story wasn 't exactly clear on where things are. So Exxon has gone outside the
            admin hearing process and asked the state superior court to approve its plan? Are any of
            these docs online?



                   Sincerely,

                                                              2
