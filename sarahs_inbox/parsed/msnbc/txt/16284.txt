                   Subject: Chamber

                 Britta: Wasilla Chamber's 2007 Youth of the Year, honoring leadership, character and community service.
                 Kris: Former Board President , former Board Vice President and Business Person of the Year (2 different years -
                 94 & 96, I believe).

                 I think introductions atone will take a good portion of time . There will be quite an impressive group. 0

                 Britta is going to sit at the head table with us also.
