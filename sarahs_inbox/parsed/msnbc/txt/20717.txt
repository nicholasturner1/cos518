              RE: Trooper Corruption
              Hi, my name is Keith Moyer I've been charged with a crime I did not commit

              I can prove the Troopers Office tampered with the evidence in my case . I would like to set up a meeting with
                       someone in
              your office, to go over this evidence.

              I've included a State DNA tab worksheet and a picture of the swabs taken at Witdwood Pretrial.
              Just in case you my have some doubts about my evidence.
              The picture of the DNA swabs on the table , are from discovery in my case.
              There are 3 swabs in the picture and only 2 swabs make it to the State DNA tab.
              Planted evidence!

              I can tell you why this could only be done by the Soldotna Troopers.


              Regards, Keith
