              I agree 100 percent!

              I was psyched to see your quick response in support via press release. Very cool.

             Just an FYI , this is what DOC sent, per my request , to Sen. Wielechowski regarding the
             latest media reports .   Bill had inquired about these two issues and asked for "the other
             side of the story ."   I suspect this won ' t stop Bill from requesting an audit from LB&A,
             but that's his prerogative .   Joe Schmidt is aware of this e-mail , also .   I asked him to
             sign off on it.

             Good Afternoon:




             Here is the response to your request for information to the Department of Corrections.
             Please contact me if any clarification is needed.



             MRSA is a staph bacteria that is resistant to most antibiotics. As far as the suggestion
             that there is an 'outbreak of MRSA' in DOC prisons, here is what Dr. Luban, DOC Medical
             officer, explained in simple form:



             MRSA exists in most places where people concentrate with their skin exposed, such.as
             school locker rooms , athletic clubs, hospitals, prisons.   When a person is exposed to MRSA
             it becomes a problem when a person ' s immune system is weak or compromised ( such as being
             in poor health) or when MRSA is exposed to an open cut or sore. The way to prevent
             exposure is through hand washing, keeping open cuts or sores closed or protected-and
             maintaining good hygiene. DOC staff understands when taking the job that they could be
             exposed to some dangerous situations such as inmates who throw bodily fluids, or who have
             Hepatitis C, Aids or MRSA.



             As for the complaint of reduced staffing in FY 06: In FY2006 the DOC employed an average
             of 703 correctional officers (filled positions). FY2007 the DOC increased the average
             filled correctional officers to 737 positions. The average filled correctional officer
             positions for the first three quarters in FY2008 is 744 positions. For FY 2009 the total
             funded CO positions has increased to 786.



             I hope this is helpful.
