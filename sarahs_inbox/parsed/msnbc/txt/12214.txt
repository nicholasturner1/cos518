              Janice, let me know if he is or isn't on the schedule. If he's not, I can call Nick and I
             also have a contact in his office that I've spoken w/twice.

               I'm going to check w Janice to see if he's on NGA agenda, otherwise maybe Nick Ayers
              could make cobtact with McCain so I could chat with him?

               Cam Ayers find us another way to get in touch with McCain? He obviously doesn't need
              Alaska, but it'd still be good to talk to him before too long.



               Hope you're feeling better!
