         OK, since the state is paying me to think and use my experience, I figure I might as well
         give my opinions until told otherwise.

         Tom Kizzia of A D N interviewed me for over an hour today on PAC West and the State's
         energy education effort.



         I did my best to focus Tom's attention on the reasons for an information campaign, the
         components of the effort, our basic messages , and the changed situation in Congress and
         its consequences for responsible oil and gas development. Tom kept coming back to PAC
         West. I reminded him that the PAC West contract came to us from the legislature, explained
         why such work is important to the total effort, described how their activities are
         supervised by us and the grant administrator, and told him that we insist on transparency
         and on a non political approach based on the merits.



         I refused to comment on PAC West's prior history, just on what they do for the State and
         mentioned that the Governor is opposed to sole source procurement's. I also indicated that
         with public funds involved, we hold our contractors to a very high standard and utilize
         State officials to do as much of the work as possible. Nevertheless, there is a need to
         spread Alaska's energy message beyond the Capital Beltway, as our opposition does on a
         regular basis.



         Tom said he called me, because this was suggested by other Administration Officials

                                                                                        I . However, if he quotes me
        accurately, 1 cnl nx       cnings wiii        come out airigtnt.



        The story will probably appear on Friday. Just wanted you to know.
