                             A Short Explanation of the Law on Gubernatorial Succession


              For Immediate Release:
              August 29, 2008


              The Department of Law has received a number of press inquiries on how the Alaska constitution
              and state statutes address what might happen if Governor Sarah Palin was elected Vice
              President, and if Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell was elected to the U .S. House of
              Representatives in the upcoming November 2008 election . Here is a brief explanation.

                                                                                                                       PRA GSP01_0023643

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 2




              If, in the November election, Lieutenant Governor Parnell is elected to Congress and Governor
              Palin is elected Vice President, and both remain in their current state offices until they assume
              those federal offices, the following would occur:

                  · At noon on January 3, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Parnell would become Alaska's U.S.
                    Representative.

                  ·   Once Lieutenant Governor Parnell left his state office, the designated successor to the
                      lieutenant governor - currently Attorney General Talis Colberg - would become
                      lieutenant governor. Governor Palin would then designate another person to succeed to
                      the office of lieutenant governor in the event of a subsequent vacancy in that office. That
                      designation would be subject to legislative confirmation.

                  · At noon on January 20, 2009, Governor Palin would become Vice President. The person
                    who succeeded Lieutenant Governor Parnell as lieutenant governor (Attorney General
                    Colberg) would then become acting governor , pending a special election. The special
                    election would be held no earlier than March 21, 2009, and no later than April 20, 2009.

              No special election for governor and lieutenant governor would be necessary unless both
              Governor Palin and Lieutenant Governor Parnell won federal office and left their state offices
              before the end of their current terms. So if Attorney General Colberg became the acting
              governor through succession, there would be a special election to fill the office of governor and
              the office of lieutenant governor. But if Lieutenant Governor Parnell became governor through
              succession and remained in that office until the end of the current term, there would be no
              special election to fill either office.

              For questions, please contact Senior Assistant Attorney General David Jones at 907-269-5169.
