           ready.

           Governor - We have been asked to do a PSA Taping for the Alaska Food Bank. We have the
           script ready and the video guys had a great idea of setting something up to tape at the
           house - i.e. It would be a great visual to have you carry in a paper bag as you read the
           script - kind of like you are coming home with the groceries. It would be a great visual
           for the TV version.



           I know we have two events at the house tomorrow - so this could be set up for Thursday or
           Friday around the lunch hour. Thanks, Janice

                Hope that didn't sound like I wasn't buying anything- just wasn't sure what to buy. .

                 I'm headed to the store to p.u. A couple of things for the House. Do you need anything?
                I have formula (orange container\sensitive) and mocha stuff on my list.

                     Thanks,
