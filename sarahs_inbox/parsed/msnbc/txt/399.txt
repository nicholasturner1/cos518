This afternoon, at their request, I met w/Doug Blossom, Dave Blossom and Dave Martin from
the Peninsula.  Jack & Debbie Brown were also planning to attend but asked to reschedule.
I won't go into all the details as it is much of what you've already heard regarding Fish
& Game.  But, I did want to pass on to you that they really hope that there will be
consideration for Roland Maw and Dwight Cramer on the Fish Board. Neither have permits
that will interfere.   They also hope that politics in fisheries management will be set
aside, support for the local biologist provided, and that Denby will go down there -
listen - and get the fisheries straightened out.
