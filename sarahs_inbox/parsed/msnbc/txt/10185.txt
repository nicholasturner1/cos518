               Emil- regarding your request to hire an AEA director... did Tom and Marty chime in on this
               idea? I want to make sure everyone's on the same page with energy policy and personnel. An
               "energy czar"-type needs to head up the cause, but DNR folks are working a plan that may
               not need a new position heading AEA. Pls touch base with them, and Bruce Anders who is
               also working on energy policy/personnel. Thanks
