             Hello Governor,

             Thank you so much for hosting the football team dinner! Everyone had a great time and really enjoyed your fun
             spirited approach to having a mansion-full of teenagers! You're the BEST!! :) THANKS!

             That oak table on the 2nd floor is only there while the basement housekeeping is torn apart from the plumbing; it
             will go back down in a month or so. Please let me know if there are any changes you'd like to make with how things
             are run at the House; I want things to be how you want them, so please don't hesitate to tell me like it is. :)

             David Munson wrote you a note , I left it on your desk by your computer.

             It sure was fun having you and the girls . Take care and have a WONDERFUL time in New York with Bristol!!

             God's wisdom and grace to you as you govern our state & take care of your family!
             Erika
