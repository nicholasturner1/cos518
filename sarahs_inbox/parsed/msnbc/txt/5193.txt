                  Just as a follow up. I did talk to the Lt. Governor about FBIC. He is the Co-Chair with Scott Merriner (his chief of
                  staff's brother). The funding appears to be in the Department of H&SS. I requested he look at the structure and
                  make a recommendation. Ultimately, he could become the single chair or we could look at an executive order to
                  move the responsibility to the Lt Gov's office. I will pass along updates as I receive them.

                 let's make sure Sean knows the Lt. Gov's office will once again be in charge of FBIC issues.
                 remind me to let him know of this.
                 thanks!
