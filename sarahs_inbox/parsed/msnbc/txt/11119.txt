             Is the PA's application made public, along with it's supplement? I assumed it was- hope
             it is- the adn made it sound like it wasn't, per Whitaker's comment.



             The public may comment on all five proposals, nothing stops that, but of course the
             application we're considering is TC's. (For that matter they may comment on CP's, also.).



             Thanks
