          Sorry- she was standing there as I was typing in her name. She's young, Native Juneau, mom
          of three, in Anchorage for cancer treatment, can't get help with daycare for her kids
          except Headstart. I said I'd see what I could do or look into. I didn't get her number
          though. Maybe Hannah could look her up somewhere and point her in right direction? Her
          daughter, Mabel, I met while visiting Gastinau School headstart class.
