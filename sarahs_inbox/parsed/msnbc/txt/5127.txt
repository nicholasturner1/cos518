                  June 1, 2006. The terms expiring are Art Nelson (consultant and son-in-law of Congressman
                  Young) and Robert Heyano from Dillingham.

                   Looking at a Law memo from 1991 the removal provisions say "for cause" and "pleasure of the
                   governor." I'm having Law look at this right now to determine which it is.

                  Thanks,

                   Ivy
