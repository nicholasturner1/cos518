                Subject: PSEA likely to start ads

               Governor & Mike:
              Just a heads up that PSEA (troopers and airport safety officers) will likely run some
              nasty ads this weekend saying the Governor and Commissioner don't care about
              public safety. Their offer to the State has been 9% + 3%+Anchorage CPI, + 3% +
              Anchorage CPI. My offer right now is 3%,3%,3% due to all of their requests for
              additional compensation in various categories, and the unknown fiscal impact of all
              of them when aggregated.

              The arbitrator's award for APEA-SU was only for 5.5%, 3% and 3%. We are trying to
              be creative in the contract, allowing flexible work schedules where the department
              finds it appropriate, but their initial offer pyramided the 5% premium pay they get, so
              that if a trooper was:
              Flying a plane in his scuba gear going to a search and rescue with a dog in the plane,
              he would get 15% premium pay on top of his regular pay. The union has backed off
              of this as a "concession".
              PSEA's tactic is to ask for the outlandish and then attempt to appear conciliatory
              with an aggressive offer.

              I'm hopeful to have good news on the APEA-SU front later today, but I will wait until I
              see the signatures.
