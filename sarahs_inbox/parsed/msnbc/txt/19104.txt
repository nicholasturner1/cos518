          Governor - On you schedule for Monday, October 1, 2007 - I have listed the request from
          the USPS - Issuance of Aurora Borealis Stamp - Photographer of Stamp and Mayor of Wasilla
          will be key speakers. They would like you to say a few words if you are able to attend.
          Beth is working on this now.



          I had called to request an earlier time for the event but they were unable to change the
          time from 11:00 a.m. @ the New Fire Station in Wasilla. I have this listed as an FYI at
          this time and have not committed you to being there. Janice
