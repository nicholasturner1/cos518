              The SHARE campaign would like you to designate one of your commissioners as chair of the
              statewide campaign . Last year's chair was Bill Noll. Anna Bell describes it as a figure head
              position and mostly teleconferences involved. Whomever you designate I will let AnnaBell know
              and also contact that commissioner.

              Thanks,

              Ivy

              Last year's chair was Commissioner William Noll. (Very little time, Mostly figure head) For time
              and some of what it takes talk with Dorie Choquette 465-3666, she was the State wide
              coordinator two years ago and did an outstanding job. A lot is done thru tele- conference and
              emails. The Steering Committee is the only committee that has meetings and that is just to get
              the things in line and going . And we usually hold those meetings here at United Way and tele-
              conference the other locations.

               Thank you for the email. Who was the chair last year? What is the time commitment? Where
               are the meetings? These are the things I will need to know before I sit down and discuss with
               Governor Palin who she will designate to serve.

               Best regards,

               Ivy Frye

             Good Morning Ivy, I need to pick you brain . I work with the "SHARE CAMPAIGN", which is State
             Employee's campaign . Each year the Governor appoints one of their Commissioners to be State Wide
             chair and he in turn picks one of his people to be State wide Coordinator or assistant Chair or what ever
             they want to call them . Who do we need to speak with in order to have Governor Palin to appoint the
             Chair?
             Thank you for any help,
             AnnaBell
