        OK, I just got logged back in. My cell died overnight.



         I will follow up to make sure the judges are moved and notified they will be participating
         in a phone interview . I will plan on staying in Anchorage well.

        Since Monday is a holiday, thursday and friday are our best days to brief legislators on
        the direction we are going. I am hopeful that we can work out final detail with you today
        and start our disucssions with legislators tomorrow.  We still need to put together the
        talking points, charts, etc. The data should speak for itself, so the charts and talking
        points should not be too difficult. We should focus on the appropriate revenues to the
        state as well as maintaining a positive environment for new companies to come explore,
                                                                 1

         invest and develop our resources.



         This afternoon, can we spend time finalizing where we are at?

         J- i can't be absent from ppt debate tonight and tomorrow - I'll have to conduct judges
         interviews via telephone. Mike can help with the re-arranging of Rep Thomas' mtg- I'm
         wondering if he can fly up here tonight or tomorrow if his mtg can't wait until my travels
         down there next wk.



         Pls don't schedule anything after the judges interviews tomorrow - I'll need to keep it
         clear for internal gross/ppt "convincing debate/discussions" with the team and then
         legislators.



        Mike- I may ask revenue/oil folks to come for casual dinner at my house thursday night for
        fuller explanations of where they think we should go on ppt/gross. I'll ask Kris to help
        me with that. This is the most imp roll-out we'll engage in... if we're not all on the
        same page, then we're doing Alaskans a major disservice.

         I can do Juneau tues evening-thurs next wk instead of tonight. Ppt is way too impt to be
         absent from the discussions. Thomas and Wilson should be told of the ppt importance this
         week, can they either fly up here if their mtg tomorrow can't wait, or be patient with my
         schedule until i can get there tues-thurs next week.

        Doesnt it make sense for me to also conduct the interviees via phone, as I've done every
        other judge interview? And I'm still not comfortable with the ppt/gross presentation from
        yest. We still haven't spoken to Mark.



        this week's schedule again got pretty full with mtgs that could wait, in light of the
        gravity of the ppt discussions that are so important to tackle before tues. Remember im
        booked over the weekend so yest, today and tomorrow are very imp days for my participation
        in ppt debate. We have to strategize better on the scheduling when we know something huge
        is around the corner so our days are more flexible leading up to a big roll-out again.

        We were working on a plan tonight to get to legislators about PPT by dividing our folks
        into teams . If we do walk through the economics we can show that we have studied many
        options and have the best balance of revenue and positive investment climate. We all
        concluded that thursday and friday are critical to reach legislators and that it would be
        very helpful if I could take several of the meetings (namely Lyda and Charlie).   What
        would you think if I stayed in anchorage thurs and did not go to Juneau and participate in
        the judicial interviews?

        We have done a pretty good tag team approach so far and I do not to leave you short
        staffed.
