            Subject:                 URGENT - Dillingham murder of 14 year old investigation - requested


            pear Governor Palin & Attorney General Colberg:



            This is a very difficult email to send.             I'd like to ask the State of

            Alaska's Attorney General's office to investigate the circumstances

            involving a murder of a 14 year boy in Dillingham by another 14 year

            old.

            I've always been suspcious of how this happened, but, yesterday on a

            flight from Dillingham to Anchorage I heard through a foster parent

            that the 14 year old suspect        Privileged or Per    was in the State of

            Alaska's custody at the time he killed the victim. I heard rumor

            previously this is the case , but, I think this warrants an independent

            review from the Attorney General ' s office.



            The suspect     Privileged or Per   was on a home visit to his mother' s

            house (where the state previously removed him from) and the mother was

            intoxicated & allowed the child to drink alcohol when the murder

            occurred.     It's a horrible situation in which the State of Alaska

            needs to be accountable for -- there's people working in positions

            that made decisions that allowed this horrific event to take place and

            we need someone to step in from outside of Dillingham to review it.

            The family of the victim is from a village and I'm sure has no idea of

            the circumstances of the case and aren't red-tape savvy to inquire

            themselves.       The homicide occurred in June of 2007.             I think

            there's people in Dillingham keeping things 'hush hush' to protect

            their jobs.



            I also ask the Attorney General to investigate how the case is

           proceeding.      My suggestion is that the Attorney General's Office

           request an entire copy of the court files involving iPrivileged or Pers

                                                                                                                                   i


             (both the Child in Need of Aid Case & the Deliquency Case )              from the

             court .    Then I think the AG should get a copy of the District

            Attorney ' s files and then copies of the Office of Children ' s Services

             Files on   Privileged or Pers   and her mother .      He should spring it on

            everyone at the same time & .          I think this warrants a visit from an

            Independent investigator from the AG ' s office to visit Dillingham.



            Our community is majorly dysfuncitonal and this is a true sign of the

            dysfunction that I saw as 12 years when I was the Clerk of Court and

            Deputy Magistrate in Dillingham .           My 14 year old daughter RoxAnn

            attended school with the suspect and the poor child never had a chance

            in life .     It's a sad ,   sad day in the State of Alaska when the children

            we're supposed to be protecting and in state custody take the life of

            another i n a black out alcoholic state.



            I can be reached at (206 ) 733-0360 cell phone ,           or at work Ocean Beauty

            Seafoods in Seattle       ( 206)285-6800    ex 1967. I'd never ,     ever go to the

            press with this information ,         but, if I ' m putting this together from

            outside the State system from rumors ,         the press will surely get ahold

            of it soon .     Your administration needs to be on it.

            Thank you .      I look forward to hearing a response soon.



            Sincerely,

            Cindy Roque
