        Governor - The call to Senator Wagnor we will be placing to him at 12:00 p.m. tomorrow,
        Friday, 09.07.07.  He wants to speak with you directly concerning the recent Board of Fish
        meeting.  He also wants to apologize to you as he felt he put you on the spot recently and
        he normally doesn't do this. We can not do this after the DPS meeting as if it runs over
        you then have the Lt. Gov. Thanks, Janice



        Senator Wagnor Contact:        398-4200 (cell)
