            Before I talk to him, is there anything new? I don't have any budget paperwork in front of
            me- but I do want to call Loy (Sharon- what's his #?), so feel free to email any
            new/additional/reminder points we're trying to relay.

            Governor - I know this weekend is probably packed, but if you have 10 minutes, Wesley
            would love a call.

            Hi Sharon:




            I'd like 10 minutes or so with Gov. Palin to talk about the state budget situation.




            I'm writing a story for our Sunday newspaper that will attempt to place in broad context
            the positions of the governor and the Legislature on budgeting this year , particuarly with
            respect to capital spending.




           I'd like to ask Gov. Palin about her fundamental goals for state spending , and whether she
           believes were headed toward a defining moment between herself and lawmakers.




            I expect this will be a prominent story.




           Ideally , I'd like to do this interview today or this evening, though I realize the
           governor has a full schedule . A Saturday interview would work.


                                                                    2




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01_0013457

            Thank you and Gov . Palin , Sharon!
