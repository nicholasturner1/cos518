                 Dear Mr. Griffin:

                My name is Jim Becker. I have been a commercial fisherman since 1967. Part of the responsibility of my
                chosen profession is to be aware of any activity on land or water that has an impact on fish habitat or
                water quality.

                I have worked with Couer Alaska since they first started development of the Kensington project and have
                found the company to always be straight with the fishing industry. Couer's current circumstance
                regarding the delay of operations is unfortunate and unfair.

                I have toured the mine site, worked with management, followed each stage of development, wrote letters
                of support many times and commented often to civic leaders in Juneau that the proposed Kensington
                mine is an example of how mining should be done in the future in the state of Alaska.

                I believe the SIR prepared for the paste tailings change at Kensington meets all NEPA requirements. It is
                unnecessary to do a new SEIS or EA given the thorough analysis provided in the SIR and three previous
                EIS's.

                Thank you.
                Sincerely yours,


                Jim Becker
