             Subject: Saturday Tea Remarks

           The Director of the Saturday Tea the Governor and Bristol are attending notified us that the theme of the Tea is:
           "Girls Can Do Anything! There will be a female police officer that speaks first (because she has to leave); then
           Lesil McGuire, then lunch, then the Governor and Bristol. A formal agenda is coming . They were hoping the
           Governor would speak to what it was like growing up in Alaska, and becoming the first female Governor, and
           "what did you do to get here?" The ages of girls attending are 5 -14. The girls have been asked to dress in "their
           Sunday best." They are expecting 150-200 girls. The event runs from 1:00 to 3:00pm.
