            MESSAGE:



            Greetings! We love you Governor Palin,(How sweet it for Pat and I to address you that
            way!) and we just want you to know how very proud we are of you... in every respect. We are
            very pleased in the way you have sought to represent all Alaskans and for standing up for
            Alaska and the gas pipeline. There is so much we would like to say and share with you,
            but your time is precious and so for now, we will close with this: We pray for you every
            single morning and at night before retiring. God bless
