             pear Sarah,   The reason I am writing is to get your views of presidential canidate Ron
             Paul.  As you may know Ron Paul has won a KTUU poll in alaska. He also has many campaign
             headquarters all over the state. In the Valley I have seen all kinds of public showing of
             Ron Paul supporters, weather it be gun shows, or supporters on the side of the road. At
             UAA the showing of support for Ron Paul continues far more than any other presidential
             canidate.   So I reside back to my question; if you are a Ron Paul supporter, and if so are
             you going to publicly show your support, as many other alaskans have. Thank you for your
             time.

             Gregory Parret                                                         Student at UAA
