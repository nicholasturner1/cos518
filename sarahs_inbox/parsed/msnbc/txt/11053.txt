                  Subject: Schedule

                Governor- I have confirmed the 10:00 a.m. appointment w/Lt. Gov, etc. on permitting for Friday, 01.11.08. Mike
                Tibbles said that he had talked with you about a teleconference call on Friday for 30 minutes on the Bill List. May
                we set that up for 9:30 -10:00 a.m. so that you are still able to leave the office by 10:30 a.m. for the Valley?
                Another option suggested was going over the Bill List on Sunday here in Juneau.

                Also, the KING AIR is available on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. for transport to JNU. We have you, Willow and Piper
                listed. Thanks, Janice
