  Subject: Invitation from Commissioner Bishop
  Hi Todd,

  Becky Weimer sent me an invitation/letter, but I know that it sometimes takes a while for you to get your
  mail through the Anch. office. I'm sure Commissioner Bishop wants you to have the official hard copy, but
  am sending you the electronic version, just to make sure you get it sooner then later.

  I'll send the original one to you- with the mail (DHL) that's sent to the Anchorage office every week.

  Erika
