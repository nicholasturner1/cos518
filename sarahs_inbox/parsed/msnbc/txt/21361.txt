             Oh baby!



             I got your back on that one... he's probably really going to come after you and I'll be
             proud to be with you.



             Ivy's got your back too. She just emailed me about jay Bird too.

             Governor, I thought I should let you know that I ran into Jay in the hall. He asked how I
             was doing . I told him I was disappointed in him, there are statesmen and there are ugly
             politicians, and he is an example of an ugly politician. Sorry,   he needed to hear the
             truth.  Tom

            I look forward to proofing AFN speech tomorrow. We have to include talk of our pro-
            mining/pro-development agenda in rural alaska without giving false hopes to Pebble.



            Please have Tom Irwin and Marty Rutherford chime in on mining issues in that speech.
            Thanks!
