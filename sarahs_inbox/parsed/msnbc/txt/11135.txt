             It will be interesting to see who couldn ' t make it in for the already - scheduled 1:00 gavel
             time . She's full of bull. Just like she was last week on the fund raiser invitation. Just
             like she was on MatMaid " assistance ", just like she was on telling reporters I was gone
             "for many weeks " at the beginning of last year ' s session , etc etc etc . She needs to be
             called on her lies.

             Lyda changed their floor session this afternoon... supposedly for those who couldn't fly in
             on time for 1:00 p.m. In reality, it was one more chance for her to complicate things.

              Yep- the "prime time" for media was never a factor. And I doubted that anyone "refused to
             give a reason"... it's not like I was ashamed of my son's graduation and would hide it.



              But at what point did Lyda change the gavel-in time from 1:00 to 6:00? Just today?
             Who's she waiting on?

              Governor,

               Bitney said they had a problem with it last week, but then Harris changed his mind and
             said 6 : 00 was o .k. In the meantime Bitney still sent the 7:00 invite to the Senate. That
             put this all in motion, because Lyda had all she needed for ammo .  The question remains,
             why should you change your travel after 6:00 was already approved a month ago?



               We NEVER refused to provide a reason for 6:00.  When they asked, we told them. Bitney
             pretended he needed a reason for 6:00 because he thought it might make us sweat. He then
             admitted he knew about the graduation all along. He had told Tkacz early last week.



               I've been consistent since last week (when Tkacz was the first one to say he knew about
             the graduation) that you had a flight to catch to go see your son graduate. I never said
             anything until it was obvious that the word was out.



               The only real bad part of the story is the quote about the prime time slot. This was
             never a factor as far a I.was concerned. I'm not sure why that even came up.    Never heard
             that was a consideration of ours.   It seems to run counter to the explanation that we
             needed 6:00 in order for you to catch a plane.

                 ADN is reporting " we" knew the 6pm was going to be a problem a week ago ( I did not),
               leaving the impression I could have changed flights . Who knew it was a problem a week ago?



                Also says I "refused " to give a reason for wanting 6pm so both House and Senate said
              7pm. Who " refused " to give reasons ( unless Bitney is spreading this , to cover his butt for
              not working with his boss - Harris - on this back in December)?
