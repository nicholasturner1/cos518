MESSAGE:

Mrs. Palin,



My wife and I heard of the recent delivery of your very special son and know the great blessings he
brings . We have a child with Down Syndrome who was born in Anchorage (6/18/97). Elisha has been
an enormous blessing to us.



Due to our desire to serve the Lord in the special needs community, we started The Elisha
Foundation. Right now we focus on holding family retreats for families of people with special needs.
We seek to provide an environment conducive to refreshment and spiritual encouragement. Go to
www.theelishafoundation.org for more on that.



All this to say that we encourage you to make much of Christ in your new one and all of your kids for
that matter.

                                                   1                             ROSTON 02231
