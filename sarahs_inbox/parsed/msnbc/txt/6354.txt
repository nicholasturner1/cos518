        I gave Kris a copy to send back with Gary. I was told it was in your packet. Our goal
        was to include some of the PPT review conclusions in the letter as a demonstration of our
        thorough review and support for the special session. Recent discussions have still left a
        question on how to address heavy oil. We were hoping to give you a quick update and have
        you in town when the letter goes out (monday would be great) so you are not out when
        legislators respond to the press.
