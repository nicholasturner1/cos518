              July 21, 2008

              Dear Colleague:

              On behalf of the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), I am forwarding to you a Flood
              Disaster Mitigation and Relief Model Act, which was adopted unanimously by the NCOIL Executive
              Committee on Sunday July 13, 2008, during the NCOIL Summer Meeting at the New York Marriott
              Marquis.

              The model act lays out a comprehensive state program to promote awareness of and access to the
              National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The model addresses insurance producer and realtor
              education, local floodplain zoning and management , mandatory purchase of flood insurance by property
              owners in floodplains, property-owner self-certification of compliance , and other hazard mitigation efforts.

              NCOIL has amended provisions in the model law regarding insurance producer education requirements.
              Among other things, the new language would allow for either basic or advanced continuing education
              requirements and would authorize online instruction . NCOIL first adopted the model act in November
              2003.

              NCOIL is an organization of state legislators whose primary area of interest is insurance legislation and
              regulation. Many legislators active in NCOIL either chair or are members of the committees responsible
              for insurance legislation in their respective state houses across the country . More information is available
              at www. ncdil.ora.

              Please do not hesitate to contact Candace Thorson in the NCOIL National Office at 518 -687-0178 or at
              cthorsonnancoil.ora should you have any questions.

              Sincerely,

              bunch of individual reporters hounding us all day. And what does Sean want to ask- remember

              adn, but we need a time-effecient plan in place to allow me to do it. Thanks

              Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staffs part. Todd
              and I can serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify
              reporters if we're doing something separate with them. I'm getting out
              of the loop at this point, pis just let me know the progress when the
              coordination is complete. Thanks

               How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of
               them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote . We have
               made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!
                Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum
               they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like
               the gov's house events they've been a part of) . Please let me know asap.

               This is what we're trying to orchestrate via this afternoon's press avail at the house. Instead of a
               bunch of individual reporters hounding us all day. And what does Sean want to ask- remember
               Talis' advice on what can and can't be said re: personnel. Of course I want to and will speak with
               adn, but we need a time-effecient plan in place to allow me to do it. Thanks

               We'll just need a head count and a confirmed time... and an understanding if they're separate events or at the same
     .1        time (I'm assuming press would be sep, perhaps before leggies... they're dying to know what we think and how we'll
               maneuver thru these days before trhe votes)

              Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staffs part. Todd
              and I can serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify
              reporters if were doing something separate with them. I'm getting out
              of the loop at this point, pis just let me know the progress when the
              coordination is complete . Thanks

              I think it is a great idea. Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA
              pre-briefing at the mansion in January 07.

              How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of
              them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have
              made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!
               Either with or without leggier, I want to speak with press in a forum
              they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like
              the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.
