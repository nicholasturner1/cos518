             Yes, I received that email, so asked Janice to contact you to set up that mtg where I'll
             be briefed on the PT findings. Thanks

             Governor, I sent an email two days ago that said Marty, Nan, and I would like to meet with
             you latter next week so we could update you on the status of the decision.



             I would never let something like this go public until we had a chance to let you know.
            We have a great team and that means communicating with the team especially the boss!



              Right now I am reading draft version 6. All have the same conclusion. Call anytime and
             I will share the last paragraph.



             Janice said you could make a meeting a week from Monday in Anchorage.                   That   would work
            great.   God bless Tom
