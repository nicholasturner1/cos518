               Up at Talkeetna, Harold Heinze told Sarah he needs 5-10 mnutes of face-to-face time
               with her.

               It's all good stuff she needs to know privately.
               Will be well worth the time and gives her some very positive stuff.

               Any time this week?
               Our office is just 3 blocks away.
               Even on short notice, he can be there in 10 minutes.

               He leaves for Houston this Sunday for 2 weeks of important spur line meetings with
               heavies.

               Would be excellent if he could get those 10 minutes with her by Friday night?

               Kris, can you get him in there?
               It's important or I wouldn't ask.

               His only real bad time is 9-10:30am tomorrow.
               Rest of this week is very flexible.

               Scott

               his number direct is 257-1347
