           Marty- the six weeks of mid-June through July are the most valuable days in AK for travel
           to communities I haven't been able to access through winter months - and I may actually
           see the King Air available for a bit of my travel in July (DPS is promising I'll get my
           turn to use it at least a few times soon! I hope...) - so I need to know how important it
           actually is to spend some of those days in Canada. I'd rather spend the time working in AK
           communities during these coming weeks, unless you believe an Ottawa visit is very
           important at this time.
