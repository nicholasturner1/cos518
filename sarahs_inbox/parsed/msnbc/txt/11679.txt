             Subject: DOT Dust Control Project in Eagle




            Governor:



            Commissioner Von Scheben asked me to let you know DOT plans on going back to the community
            of Eagle on February 5th, holding a public hearing on the proposed dust control project,
            and if the community is overwhelmingly against it, dropping the project. (The project and
            the communities opposition to it was the subject of a recent news story).
