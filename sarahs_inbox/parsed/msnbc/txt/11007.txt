             Below is my proposed response to Carl Marrs.&nbs= p; For several reasons, I have formatted
             it as a letter to the editor = from you.



              I understand that this format involves a limit = of 225 words .                  I think I've hit all of
              the major themes , but there = isn't much elaboration.

             Note to Palin :    ' Earmark '   means money Alaska needs

             COMPASS :   Points of view from the community

             CARL MARRS     - 01/10/2008

             I = and other Alaskans have spent a lot of time trying to understand why the = Palin
             administration would announce publicly that it was going to = drastically cut the earmarks
             the state seeks from our congressional = delegation . It makes no sense to us. By doing it
             so publicly , she may have = jeopardized all other existing federal funding for Alaska.



             The= Palin administration says earmarks make Alaska look bad . However , an earmark = is
             nothing more than a word for special projects . And because our = infrastructure needs eons
             to catch up with the rest of the nation just to = bring us into some sort of parity, we
             need many special projects. _



             Pal= in's cutback on earmark requests (or special projects) will make it even = more
             difficult to make things happen in Washington, D.C., and it's already very difficult
             indeed. Most people in the = Lower 48 would just as soon see this state locked up in one
             big park or = wildlife preserve. The last thing we need to tell Congress is: "We don't =
             want your money; we have enough."



             The= governor and many among our news media are painting a bleak picture of = earmarks,
             suggesting they are there to be abused . Nothing could be further = from the truth.
             Earmarks have been used for decades by many other senators = from many other states and
             will continue to be used in the future in some = other form . It's not like Sens . Stevens
             and Murkowski and Congressman = Young have invented earmarks , or the projects the funding
             was going to be = used for. These projects were requested by the State of Alaska or the
             residents of Alaska.



             We = elected our congressional delegation to go to Washington, D.C., to fight for funding
                                                                   2




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0009704

              for our state. It would seem that = Palin's negative portrayal of the process has the
              potential to harm = Alaska's stability and its future.

              On = the one hand, Palin wants to tax the hell out of our biggest industries. = At the
              same time, we need funding for infrastructure, health, education = and public safety. By
              casting a shadow over all of it, she has now put so = much of what we need at risk. Surely
              she doesn't think the state can pay = for everything?



              I - don't know where her advice is coming from, but it reminds me of the old = fairy tale,
              "The Emperor's New Clothes." If this administration keeps this = up, eventually the people
              will see there is nothing there.

             In = the case of Gov. Palin, most of us can agree she was a very attractive = candidate
             who knew exactly how to appeal to the widest possible audience. = When you're trying to
             get elected, that's a strategy that's obviously very = effective. But we're not in an
             election (or are we?). We're at the point = where the rubber meets the road. We're at the
             stage where we need more = than rhetoric, more than promises, more than attacks on others.
             We need = results.



             Gov    Palin, Alaska needs policymakers who have vision. Alaska needs can-do builders who
             = can start a project and see it through to the finish. Gov. Palin, = Alaska needs
             leadership. We want you to succeed on Alaska's behalf, but giving up on = federal funding
             leaves some serious questions.
