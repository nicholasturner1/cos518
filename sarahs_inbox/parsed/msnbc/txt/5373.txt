             Governor,  sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, Yesterday started at 4:00 and ended ar
             10:00.  The meetings have gone well, The only tough issue was last night on

             PLA,s and this was realy a union

             hire issue not an Alaskan hire issue.



             Today is non stop until 1:00. Do you have any time to visit between 1:00 and 2:00 on the
             First Nations meeting? God bless your day! Tom

            Thanks Tom - let's chat about it when I get to my office - it's a snow day here, I guess,
            but some of us will be in.

            Governor, I sent this out yesterday as my cell phone battery was going out. I am
            resending to make sure you received the email. Sorry if it is a duplicate. Wanted your
            thoughts before Joe and I meet with some of the First Nations people from Canada. See 2nd
            email below.



            Also thanks for making last Friday so great!                   Tom

             Tom,



            Here's what you sent out last night.  The arrangement for Tuesday is at 2 pm in the
            Governor's office.  We are likely to be on teleconference.



            As far as the media meetings go, I would like to go with you to all of them Monday I will
            have a vehicle, but on Tuesday it would be most convenient for my family if they can drop
            me off in town in the morning. Then I would need to get out to the airport around 4.



            Thanks, Tom.



            Joe

            Governor and everyone:




           I suggest that In the first meeting, after we talk about the new energy in Alaska, we
           stress that the Governor has established a fair, open process that could include the
           Canadian route or the LNG route. We need to let them know that they could positively or
           negativlely affect the economics of a Canadian route and consequently any benefit to them.
           Also it is likely the successful applicant would be doing all or part of the negotiations.
           We do have a good opportunity to set the foundation for their thinking and a positive
           relationship.




           Appreciate any and all comments so we can think about this more before the meeting.
           Thanks Tom
                                                               2



                                                                                                         PRA GSP01_0000504

             Thanks so much Joe. And if they happen to still be there on Saturday,           remember I'll be up
             in Fairbanks that weekend if they wanted to meet then.

             The request that came in from the White River First Nation came in with a date during your
             trip to DC. As such, I made
