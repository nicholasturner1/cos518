              Dear Beth,
              Thank you so much for your message and for our delightful conversation . You have
              made my day . The IOGCC is so very lucky to have Gov. Palin as its chairman and I
              know the organization will serve her well.

              I arrive in New Orleans tomorrow at a little after 4 in the afternoon and should be at the
              Omni Hotel by 5. There is no problem in accommodating the Governor 's schedule on
              Monday. Victor will be able to present the Stewardship Awards , and Gov . Hoeven will
              be there as well to present them, so that will be just fine from our end.

              I am copying this to Gerry Baker, the associate executive director, and to Erica Carr, our
              communications manager, who will get a draft press release to you. Gerry's cell
              number is 405-664-7362 and he is already at the hotel, as is Erica. If for some odd
              reason my cell phone is not ringing through, Gerry may be available. We will have an
              IOGCC office set up in the Hotel by tomorrow morning when we can assist the
              Governor with any clerical needs and the location of the IOGCC office will be listed with
              the hotel.

              My Blackberry will also be on, so I can get any e-mail communications you send
              (usually!). I'm certain there will be good cell service in new Orleans.

              Thanks for all of your work this afternoon . The Governor is served by a very dedicated
              and efficient woman!
              Christine

               Dear Christine:

               On behalf of Governor Sarah Palin, I am pleased to inform you that she is honored to
               accept the chairmanship of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and be
               presented as the new chairman at the annual meeting on Monday, Sept. 24 in New
               Orleans.

               She will plan to present her speech as scheduled on Monday, however she will need to
               leave the hotel no later than 11:30 a.m. We need to change the order of the program so
               that the MOU could be signed BEFORE the chairman's awards are given. As her departure
               would conflict, we would need Victor Carillo to continue to be the person to present those
               awards.

               Should Governor Palin have more questions, when will you arrive in New Orleans and
               where can she reach you before Monday's annual meeting? Please let me know and I will
               forward that information. I did give her your cell number (405-664-7361).

              We'd like to send out a news release about this honor..Can you send me a draft and we
              can handle it from our end?

              Please email or call if you need more information at this time.
