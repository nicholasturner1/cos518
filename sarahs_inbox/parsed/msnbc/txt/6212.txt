             I, for one have been contacted , and left with an approximate 5 inch high stack of paperwork . I do recall that this
             general issue has been discussed between all of us earlier , I also understand that we are working for a fair
             resolution to these negations and had stated so.

              Commissioner Kreitzer is in travel status, but asked that I forward this message to
              all of you. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

              Thank You.

             Commissioners:

             I'm aware that Bruce Ludwig, Business Agent for the APEA-Supervisory Unit, has
             either met with some you or is requesting a meeting with you. I want to remind you
             that labor negotiations are just that - negotiations . We have been negotiating in
             good faith with the union which represents some employees in your department.

             I have my charge from Governor Palin and I understand what the bottom line is.
             What I need you to do , is remember that as Bruce tells you his concerns - you have
             perhaps not heard the issues from my perspective.

             Please contact me directly with any questions you might have as a result of your
             conversations with Bruce .  I have done more to be transparent about labor
             negotiations than, I believe , any other Commissioner , by posting our last best
             offers online . You can access that information here:

             We are all in this together. We all need quality, professional State employees.
             Governor Palin has the draft administrative order I referred to in our last Cabinet
             meeting and I expect we'll be moving forward shortly.

             Thanks for your patience.
