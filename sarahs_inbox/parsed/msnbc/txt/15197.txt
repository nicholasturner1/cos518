            Is Steve going to be at the cabinet meeting or call in to discuss the short term energy
            plan?

            discussions and will focus in on details related to the energy plan for Thursday. He'll
            be working w/Steve on it today and will coordinate also w/Rosanne & Sharon. So, hopefully
            we'll have more info this afternoon.
