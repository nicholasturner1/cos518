           I spoke w /John and they cannot do a Sunday dinner after the Fairbanks picnic because
           they'll be returning that eve from traveling to ANWR. They ' d like to do Sat . The caravan
           is available to take up Sat after Anch picnic and then we ' d overnight . Let me know if this
           is acceptable and I'll let John know.

           Can I tell Mr. Boehner ' s office anything about the Governor ' s plans for next weekend when
           the Boehner entourage will be in Fairbanks and on the North Slope? As I recall, the only
           remaining option for the Governor was dinner in Fairbanks on Saturday evening.



           Thanks for any information you can provide.
