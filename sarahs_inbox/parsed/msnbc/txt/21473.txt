             Looks like you may be able to do it. I can bring Rachel (Grace is in Guatemala with a
             mission team from her school) to hang out with Piper and probably Sandy too, leaving you
             and I free to shake hands as the troops board the plane.

             J- it looks like the only way I could do this is to iv Juneau on sunday morning, then turn
             right around and head back that evening - can you confirm the exact time of the
             deployment- ideally the later the better be I'm scheduled to arrive Anchorage late in
             afteroon. Bob will check flts for me.



             Also if u want to note on sched I'm here at afn now for opening ceremonies.

             I'm thinking we should do this if you're in town. Will you be able to-- I'm free to do it.

             Bravo Company, 297th Support Battalion will leave Alaska at 12:35pm on 28 October from
             Elmendorf.

             They will be boarding the planes at the Elmendorf Joint Mobilization Center.

             It would be an honor to have the Governor and the Lt. Governor attend this event and shake
             the hands of the Soldiers as they board the aircraft.

             Please give me a phone call if you need any assistance.

             Thanks,
