            Head's up- hopefully we'll get this publicized soon after Talis says yes. I'll take the
            blame if folks get ticked about us filing the appeal after apoc forgave Ben- it was my
            call.

            Yes we did. I will check and see if there is any reason why it would not be public and
            then I will let you know. Talis.

             Did we file the appeal re: Ben and APOC? Is it public yet that we're doing this?
