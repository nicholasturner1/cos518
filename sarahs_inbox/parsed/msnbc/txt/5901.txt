           At the suggestion of Bill Stoltze , I'm writing letters to North Slope Borough Mayor Edward Itta and the coach and
           remarkable players of the high school women's basket team from Anaktuvuk Pass , the Nunamiut Wolves, who
           won this year's 1A state championship with only five players . Talk about heart ! (See the Anchorage Daily News
           story below.)

           It would be nice to get a photograph to send them of the Governor sitting at her desk. Perched on the corner of
           her desk is the basketball autographed by those five remarkable women.

           All this will be warmly received by Mayor Itta, who had planned quite a reception for the Governor in Barrow last
           Monday - complete with drummers comprised of Barrow whaling captains . The plan was to send off the Governor
           with drummers lining the way to her plane so she could feel "the heartbeat of Barrow " as she was leaving - a
           gesture of respect and gratitude.

           Do we have a fun job, or what?
