                 I check into this Donnie. Thank you! And let me know if you're successful with the electronic
                 application soon.

                  I have tried several times to renew our business license online. Your site
                  will not even accept out telephone number. I keep getting your message to
                  "enter number, including area code", then it rejects because I cannot enter
                  the number.

                  Last year, it was relatively simple to renew online. Whatever changes you
                  made: THEY DO NOT WORK! So, until you fix the glitches, I am in a quandary
                  about what to do. I suppose I can just do it. by snail mail, but that will
                  put me even farther out of compliance.

                  By the way, I have cc'd this to Governor Palin. Fix your website.

                  Thank You. (A reply would be nice, as this has been a problem since January)
