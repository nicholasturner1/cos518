         Dear Mr. See:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the.FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

          Thanks for having the courage and wisdom to veto a portion of the capital budget projects.
          You're on the right track and the avearage Alaskan is behind you all the way. We need an
          overhaul on the CIP budgeting process and your first step is RIGHT ON!



          A second thanks is for the visit to our Palmer Forestry Facility last week . Your personal
          visit was much appreciated . All I kept hearing after you left is " There goes the best
          Governor this state has ever seen ". It's great to have a real Alaskan at the helm . Keep it
          up! Thanks again.
