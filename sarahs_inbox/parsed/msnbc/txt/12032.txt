              Hi,




              Just a quick note for either Sarah or Cora. I'm jamming a few news highlights from 2007
              into our Yearbook issue which publishes in April and wanted to run 75 to 100 words about
              Sarah's/your first year in office. The big question? Did she/you find time to fish
              Bristol Bay again this summer? And for how long?



              Cheers , and good luck in the year ahead , Charlie Ess
