        Sorry I missed your call -        I was on the line with Todd.           The AGIA members are:



        House - Ralph Samuels,      Mike Chenault, Mike Kelly, Reggie Joule

        Senate - Charlie Huggins, Bert Stedman, Lyman Hoffman



        Regarding AML -

        I tried and he was unresponsive. He said that last year they were asked as a group to
        support Murkowski's plan and they debated hard and it divided their group. They were not
        able to come to any conclusion. Ray did not think the group wanted to go through that
        again.  He would not recognize that we are presenting a different plan at a different time
        with different players.



        Mike

        Subject: Resolutions



        Jb - does anyone know why ray gillespie didn't produce anything with AML members to get
        their communities support of agia via Resolutions?



        Ray is asking much from us with AML issues - but where did he go on helping us with agia?
        Tell him its not too late to get a reso out of aml.
