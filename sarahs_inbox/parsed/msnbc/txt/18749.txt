         In that light... Randy tells me that the Mayor and Rick Svobodny ( head of the criminal
         division ) will be on Ch. 11 tonight . The Mayor is still criticizing the state for poor
         performance in regard to our district attorney ' s office .  Rick has the statistics to show
         he is wrong and will be factual in his response .   ( Same statistics Talis shared with us
         previously that show we are taking more municipal cases that we were four years ago).

          Oh my goodness.



          Pis don 't "ok" this until Talis and I speak . There' s more to Begich 's positions lately
          than they're allowing citizens the opportunity to realize.

          Sharon,

          Here is a draft of some possible language about resolution of the prisoner transport
          issue.

          Let me know if your folks would like to do a joint release and what additions / changes they
          would have.

          Thanks. Julie
