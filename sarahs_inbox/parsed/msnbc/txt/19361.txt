              Just an FYI, I spoke w/Faircount. They will do whatever necessary to convey the correct story and
              correct the misinformation. I've shared this info w/Sharon. Also, a piece is being prepared for a
              commission member.

              I just spoke to Chris Constant. He is a member , and was at the time the contract was executed. He
              should sign. I'll give info to Sharon.

              I'm still going to work on Farrcount. They are not very responsive - which is not anything new.

              Colleen is taking care of contacting the letter writer and may have already done so.
