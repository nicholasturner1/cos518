              I just spoke with Erika. She did not bring up the question of cooperation with the
              Congressional delegation, thus it would still be useful to have that discussion at a later
              date.  My conversation was fairly short, as she did seem to be on a tight deadline, and
              she was mainly interested in the nature of the brief the State was preparing. I briefly
              described to her the history of the state's involvement in the private plaintiff punitive
              damage claim by way of prelude to telling her that we were new to this particular
              discussion and therefore still developing the brief. I then told her that in general we
              anticipated the brief would include a discussion of the legal issues enumerated by the
              Supreme Court as well as address Exxon's view that the payments it had made to the
              Governments for fines, penalties and damages somehow meant that it should not have to pay
              punitive damages . She asked if there was any particular legal issue that concerned us and
              I mentioned the second issue , the supposed preemptive effect of the Clean Water Act on
              common law punitive damages.

              Governor:




              Erika called early this afternoon with a request for an interview.



              However she is working on deadline now, she said she is filing her story in the next few
              minutes , and you are otherwise committed.



              Craig Tillery will give her a quick interview.



              I talked to Erika about doing another, longer piece in the near future and we'll work with
              her and Janice to get something on your schedule so that we can still get your message
              out.



              Beth

             Erika Bolstad, the ADN's DC reporter, has contacted the Alaska = Congressional delegation
             to ascertain whether they intend to join the - State's amicus brief in the Exxon Valdez
             litigation.  It isn't clear = whether a secondary goal is to try to identify or create a
             rift = between the Governor and the delegation.



             The delegation may respond as an entity or as individuals. In = any event, I'm told that
             they will refer to the close communication = and coordination which has occurred so far.
