               It's no prob at all for the decorations tomorrow. And the house looks beautiful! I can't
               wait for the kids to see it. Thanks!

                        Hello!



                     That's just not right- who leaves Hawaii early??!!! Good decision though; it would
               be hard to relax and enjoy the sun, warm sand, tropical smells, drinks w little
               umbrellas...  Now you'll just need to go back!! :)



                     It would be cool if they were able to meet up- Alex was all happy when he found out
               you guys would be there-and so close! The kid would probably run 5 miles if he had too,
               he's such a goof!



                     Did you see my note about decorators on Monday (9-4) it's no problem to reschedule,
               but I wanted to check with you before I made any calls.

                     Hi E-

                     I hope Bristol found Alex . I think our hotels are just a few doors down.



                    I hustled back to Juneau early - felt to guilty and nervous being away w / special
              session. .. so I'm here . Todd and kids stayed for the wedding that is tonight , they'll
              return to Anchorage late Tuesday . It was flippin ' GORGEOUS there!
