                  The WSJ is launching a new magazine in September. They would like to interview you for the "get
                  fit" section. The interview could be over the phone. They want to ask about what you do for
                  exercise - what do you eat for breakfast etc. Here is the catch- they want to send a photographer
                  up in the next couple of week to shoot you exercising. When they pitched this - I thought of a
                  photo op with you running with Trig is the baby jogger.

                  This may be a good opportunity to. promote our get fit challenge.

                  Thoughts?
