                Dear Governor Patin,
                    Attached is the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act decision I just referred to in another email. The top of
                page two summarizes the essence of the decision . Two justices did not participate and one (Fabe) dissented. So
                it was decided by 2 of 5 justices . Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                P rivileged or Personal M aterial                   My staff is working on a brief summary which I can forward
                when it is ready . This may get some attention in that it strikes down retroactive application of the law for crimes
                before 1994. Talis
