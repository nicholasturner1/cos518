              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                        No. 08-158

                                  Governor Palln Speaks Out in Support of OCS Drilling

              September 15, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Patin submitted the state of Alaska's
              comments to the federal Minerals Management Service (MMS) on the preparation of a new five-year
              Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Governor Patin praised the MMS for
              embarking on this effort to update the five-year leasing program, and confirmed the state's support
              for the proposed oil and gas leasing programs in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and limited areas in
              the North Aleutian Basin, as well as for the special interest sales for the Cook Inlet planning areas.

              "The oil and gas resources within the state of Alaska and In the federal waters off our shores can
              contribute greatly to the natural gas supplies of this nation, as well as diversify the nation's oil and
              gas supply areas," Governor Patin said. "My support of the five-year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing
              Program, and specifically the development of those resources off the shores of Alaska, is directly
              linked to promoting the nation's energy Independence from foreign oil and gas."

              Included in Governor Patin's letter is her support for MMS to work closely with residents and local
              governments within the leasing regions, oil and gas companies, and other stakeholders to minimize
              conflicts, especially with subsistence activities, fishing activities, and fish and wildlife resources.

             Dear Governor Sarah ; I apologize for intruding into your email but I need to contact your husband Todd and the
             only contact I found online was a phone number which I feel is too personal . I am a member of the Los Angeles
             Adventurers Club which meets every Thursday evenings near downtown LA and was wondering if Todd would be
             interested in speaking about his snow machine races and commercial fishing tales . We are a private men's club
             and as such are apolitical so we are interested in adventure and it sounds like Todd has had plenty of. There are
             usually about 50 to 70 members and their guests who attend the meetings . The evening starts out with a group
             dinner and then we all move to the auditorium for club business and the guest speaker . Please check us out on
             our website and give this matter some serious consideration.

                                                                           Best Regards & God Bless ... Fredrick Gary

             Dear Governor Palin:

             My son , Ian, participated in the Tesoro Iron Dog from Georgia , via the Flat Stanley project, Team 26.   1 would
             love to send you the picture and news clipping the local paper printed.

             While all the Democrat intellectuals wonder where you came from , Flat Stanley set off for Alaska and came home
             with the scoop, which was printed in our paper on March 19, 2008. Where may we send this news clipping for
             your perusal?

             I would love for Ian to meet you and shake your hand when you come to Georgia, if circumstances ever permit
             Regardless, please ask Mr. Pal?n if he would be so kind as to autograph Ian's Flat Stanley, we will enclose a
             SASE when we discover where we should forward the material.

             We, like so many Americans , are proud of you and are just ecstatic to have our families linked together through
             the Tesoro Iron Dog?

             LOL,
