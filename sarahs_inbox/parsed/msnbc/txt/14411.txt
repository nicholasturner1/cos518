            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,




            I am a practicing pediatrician in Louisiana. I recently read of your delivery and some of
            the "concern" surrounding it.   I applaud you and your husband for carrying Trig to term.
            Your views are shared by the majority of Americans, yet not the majority of elites.
            Thanks for turning the tide of our nation to life and the blessings of Almighty God. May
            the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you as He bears you on angel wings.



            Respectfully,




            David McGehee
