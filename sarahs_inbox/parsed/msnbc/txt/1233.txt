MESSAGE:

Congratulations on the birth of you son Trig!!! How wonderful that your family welcomed him with
open arms. Your family statement was beautiful and perhaps will help others who find out their baby
has Down Syndrome accept the treasure that God has given them. My daughter Colleen has
Trisomy 21 and she brings us immense joy each and every day of her life. She is now 20 months old
thanks for a gifted heart surgeon who repaired her heart when she was 3 months old. Perhaps one
day she will meet Trig! We wish you much happiness and few sleepless nights.

Lori O' Donnell and family
