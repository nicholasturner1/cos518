             According to the Supreme Court website, the Exxon Valdez decision = will not be issued
             today.  The opinion could be issued on Wednesday = or possibly Thursday of this week, as
             there are now seven cases = remaining. We will keep a close eye on this progression.



             Per my discussions with Mike Nizich and Rosanne Friday night, we will = now turn our
             attention to distribution of the ANWR letter and will work = with Rosanne on a press
             announcement.




             John W. = Katz

             Director of = State/Federal Relations

             and Special = Counsel to the Governor
