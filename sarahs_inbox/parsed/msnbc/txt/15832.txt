          Hello Govenor Patin,




          As a longtime Wasilla resident I have pride in our city, the new Palmer-Wasilla extension
          to Knik Road was a welcome addition to the ever increasing traffic problem for Knik road
          residents, they took the time to make a faux-look red brick meridians and since early
          spring I have noticed that they are covered with gravel from the winters sanding, I called
          the Road Maintanance crew in Palmer and they said that their sweepers were down.. and they
          onoy have a couple of them and with all the other road maintnance jobs they have to do
          they don't have time to fix them! The dust is so bad and when the tennagers whip around
          the corners they spray gravel at you! :) Please allot funds for sweepers:) It may seem
          trivial, but you cannot put sand and gravel on the roads year after year and not pick it
          up!  We will back to gravel roads in that case! Thanks for your time... and
          congratulations on your new baby boy and all the great work you are doing for us Alaskans!
          :)  Sincerely, Christine
