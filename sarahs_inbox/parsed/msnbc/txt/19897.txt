           In fact, the topic will be great for cabinet mtg/lunch that we're trying to organize for
           Juneau this week.

          Subject :   Deal with IBU




          We reached a deal with IBU. Unlikely as it sounds.   We compared what it would have cost
          us with a 3,3,3 over the last two years and offered:



           $2137 signing bonus for each employee for the first year (0% in lieu of $2137 cash)

           followed by 5% effective July 1, 2009

           followed by 4% effective July 1, 2010.



           We considered with this union the savings of them NOT having a contract for going on two
          years and our conversations with Washington state which ended up going to arbitration with
          its maritime unions, where they were treated pretty well.



           The amount of money involved was minor to get to this agreement, considering our options.

           More specifics later.
