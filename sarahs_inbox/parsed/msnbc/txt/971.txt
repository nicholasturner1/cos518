  Please find attached the request for the Governor to visit the Marine Exchange of Alaska's Vessel
Tracking Operations Center. Todd would like to do this with Mike Nizich. I know Todd will be in JNU
this upcoming week so maybe in can be set up anytime from Mon. through Fri. 03.10-14.08.



I will call them directly to let them know they will be hearing from a staff member on setting this up as
the Governor will not be available due to schedule. Thanks, Janice
