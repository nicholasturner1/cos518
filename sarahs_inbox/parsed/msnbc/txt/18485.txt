         Subject: U.S. Flag Lowered




         In accordance with the "Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Federal Flag Code Amendment Act of
         2007," Governor Sarah Palin authorizes you to lower the U.S. flag for today's memorial
         service at Fort Wainright in honor of the five aviators from Task Force 49, who were
         killed in action when their CH 47 crashed in Iraq.
