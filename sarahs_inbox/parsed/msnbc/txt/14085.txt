            Governor, I believe all will be ready for the afternoon press conference. Steve
            Haagenson, Bruce Anders, Pat Galvin and I are meeting first thing tomorrow morning in
            order to structure the message and to sort out who should say what (between you, Steve &
            Rhonda).  Bruce and I will also work with Sharon Leighow.

             Marty
