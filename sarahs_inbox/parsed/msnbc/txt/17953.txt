          INTERVIEW



         May I suggest a briefing Monday afternoon via teleconference ?                  We can walk

         through the issues and then digest over the course of the day. That way, if

         there are follow-up questions ,        we can tackle as well before the meeting.



        Thanks,

        Meg

         Governor, its DNR's responsibility to prepare answers to these questions.

         We will make sure that they are ready for your review by Monday afternoon.



         Any comments or other possible questions from anyone are appreciated.



       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


       Privileged or Personal M .   We want a "new energy" in Ag also. Ag has some serious

         problems, none caused by this Administration and most caused by external

        problems like the border closure because of mad cow disease .



         We have a lot of work to do. Ag has had multiple problems through the yeaes

         and I don't think it will be easy to solve them, but it is worth the effort.

         I think Dick Lefebvre has been working on this from the right direction,

        meeting with people involved in various areas in Ag. Another meeting is

         scheduled in Palmer on Tuesday.



        Governor,     we can review Ag any time your schedule allows.



        Meg, thanks for getting these questions. Tom

         I don't know the history of these issues , or of the dept. in general - so

         those who do should chime in. thanks!



         Meghan Stapleton < meghan_stapleton@gov.state.ak.us> wrote :            The attached is

         not exhaustive , but it will give you an idea of what Rob

         Stapleton would like to cover in his agriculture interview with the Governor

         and Commissioner Irwin on Tuesday at 1:30pm in the Governor ' s Anchorage

         office.



         He will be rather skeptical and confused because he feels that it's not the

         administration's priority and that the ag department is quite unorganized

         and confused on its own policy (DeVilbiss' resignation only added to it).
