          Governor Palin,




          I saw an article that you were on the short list for VP candidate.




          I am Alaska Native and was raised in Anchorage. I moved to Colorado Springs last year. If
          you become a candidate let me know how i can help the campaign from Colorado.




          Also, congratulations on the birth of your beautiful baby boy!




                                                               1
