            If we do press, why don't we invite leggies who can explain their side of this again- let
            Harris answer. I'm going to hate the perceived pettiness of this, and the "he said-she
            said" angle that Harris, et al, suggests re: who's not trying hard enough to communicate
            through this. We could at least say we (unprecedented, again) invited leadership to share
            in the press availability with us so we all can communicate with Alaskans about this-
            they're the important ones in this issue.
