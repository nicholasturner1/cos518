                 Subject: Fox Business Tuesday

                We've had a request from Fox Business Network for an in-studio interview tomorrow
                (Tuesday, Feb. 26), after the Hoover and CNN events.

                Fox is interested in Exxon Valdez, oil. and gas, and the economy.

                This request could fit in your schedule before you need to head to the airport at 3:30
                p.m. The location is about 2 miles from the Willard , so the logistics will work.

                If you would like to do this, I'll forward all information to you, Janice and Sharon.
