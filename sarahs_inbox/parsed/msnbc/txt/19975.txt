                     AGIA Update

               Alaska stands poised and ready to provide critical relief to fellow Alaskans and to Americans during this I
               need. We are proud to say that we have come so far toward finally getting Alaska 's valuable natural gas
               way that protects the state 's interests and benefits all Alaskans.

               The Alaska State Legislature is currently debating whether to approve TransCanada Alaska for the state
               natural gas pipeline. Legislators have listened to hundreds of hours of thoughtful discussion from consult
               people all over Alaska who deeply care about the state's future, and I want to thank them for conducting

               continue to help the State Senators make an educated decision on the merits of AGIA as well.

                Over the course of a year, AGIA has proven to be exactly what the State of
                Alaska needs . For the first time ever, we now have a committed partner who
                                                                                                                  C The Alaska Gasline Induce
                is willing to provide exactly what Alaska demands for her citizens and with
                an enforceable timeline that exceeds our expectations.

                This is an exciting time for Alaskans. And we look forward to moving
                together as a team, as Americans look north to the future for assistance.




               In an effort to better serve Alaskans , my administration made some positive changes to the summer 200

               (32 percent for passengers and 22 percent for vehicles) and Prince Rupert (25 percent for passengers al
               vehicles.) We've been receiving positive comments from many communities, and well continue to work t
               transportation needs of all Alaskans.

                  Adding a little bit of activity to each day is so important to our overall physical and mental health. Alaskans did just that when
                  more than 2,800 of them signed up to compete in the National President 's Challenge, a program that required people to get 30
                  minutes of exercise for at least five days a week for a six -week period. I'm proud to tell you that Alaska had a first-place finish
                  and in July, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leayitt presented the National President's
                  Challenge Award to Alaska for having the highest participation rate in the nation based on population . We are definitely moving
                  in the right direction, and that's great news for our state.




                  Alaska is strengthened by people with an entrepreneurial spirit , and small firm owners are making a major       X? Fees Reduced
                  contribution to our state economy . That's why I'm pleased to tell you that I was able to sign into law
                  legislation my administration put forward to reduce business license fees . House Bill 111 decreases the
                  fee for business licenses from $ 100 to $50 and will take effect October 1 , 2009, when the sale of 2010
                  licenses begins.

                Back in April , I encouraged state employees to help our men and women in uniform by donating cell phones which could be
                shipped overseas via a program called Cell Phones for Soldiers . Now, several months later, the Department of Administration
                has collected 271 used state and personal cell phones. This will mean 271 hours of talk time for soldiers abroad , since each
                phone is recycled in exchange for a one -hour calling card. In July, the Department of Administration shipped two boxes (52
                pounds) of cell phones out of Juneau . The department is also working with individual Alaskans who are interested in donating
                independently. For more information, contact Vern Jones , Director of the Division of General Services, at

                II am encouraged to share with you that tobacco use in Alaska has declined more than 20 percent overall                              I

                state's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey for 2007. The reduction equals more than 27 , 000 fewer smokers since 1996.

                  There is also a significant reduction in Alaska Native high school smokers , from 62 percent in
                  1995 to 44 percent in 2003 to 32 percent in 2007 (Youth Risk Behavior Survey). Smoking is          C Kaska Smoking Rate Drops
                  also down significantly among women - from 24.2 percent in 1996 to 18 .9 percent in 2007
                  (national prevalence is 18.4 percent). The steepest decline is among adults age 40-59, from
                  28.7 percent in 1996 to 21.6 percent in 2007_

                The drop can be attributed to a sustained comprehensive tobacco prevention program,
                including tax increases, clean indoor air policies, media, community programs and the Alaska
                Tobacco Quit Line.



                Alaskans enjoyed great music , food and community as my

                citizens at the Governor's Annual Picnics in Wasilla,
                Anchorage and Fairbanks in July. I truly enjoy these picnics
                and the opportunity to meet Alaskans in a fun and informal
                setting, and want to thank the many sponsors and
