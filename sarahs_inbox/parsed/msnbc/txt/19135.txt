         Maybe meeting with the KABATA investors in NY while I'm there? Or any of Pat Galvin's DOR

        Thanks. I do want to capitalize on my East Coast trip that week though. There may be other
        options hopefully.

        I understand that you might want my opinion on the advisability = of coming to DC on
        October 9th to meet with one or more members of the = Congressional Delegation.

          I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy .   The congress
          will not be in session during the week of = October 8th , which is the Columbus day recess,
          and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.

         we might do in response.
