         The agenda is literally just the six items and I mentioned to them that it

         appears as though they would like for you to listen to their concerns and

         interests rather than address them in any way.'

        Hi Meghan,



         Please see the following list of issues our group developed today to

        discuss with the Governor tomorrow:



        * Education - New Commissioner

        * 8a Issue - Statewide impacts and National opportunities

                                                                 1




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0002663

         * Gasline

         * Energy policy

         * Subsistence

         * 50th Anniversary of Statehood



         We realize that she has a very busy schedule and may not be able to get

         to all of these issues so we will try to talk about continued

         discussions.



         Thank you for assisting with the coordination of our meeting,



         Sheri

             Tour sounds great. Most press knew you were there as I felt that I had to say why you were away. Press release is a
             great idea. We have one for emergency regs tomorrow and kohring, too.
