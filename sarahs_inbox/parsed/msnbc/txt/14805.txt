            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on your new baby boy! I read about your new arrival on the internet and
            wanted to extend my heartfelt congratulations. I have a 17 year old daughter who has Down
            syndrome and everyday is a happy blessing with her in the lives of my family! Your son
            will have a wonderful effect on lives of your other children, family members, and even
            colleagues.  What a wonderful opportunity you and your family have to watch him grow and
            teach others about acceptance, humility and love.



            Sincerely,



            Pasqua "Packy" Boggs
