               Below are Karleen's bullet points regarding changes at OCS. I will print a copy and have
              Janice place a one in your reading file. When we can fit it in, it would still be a good
              idea to have her come over and discuss their progress.   o.-;,,;Ie,,e,a o-,,,, ., i en-4eri.,l oeA-,.+
