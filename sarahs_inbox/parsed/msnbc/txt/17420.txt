           I talked to Privileged or on Friday and he's holding out for something else. I talked to Tib today and he said he
           had something in mind for him . I've solicited the help of our good FBX people to find a woman to serve. It's a
           board dominated by men so a woman might bring needed balance . I'll let you know what I find.

           I met w/ Kate Giard for almost an hour today. I filled Mike in tonight. I'll fill you in tomorrow.

           Welcome back to town!!!
