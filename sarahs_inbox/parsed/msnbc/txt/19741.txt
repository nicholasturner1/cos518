           MESSAGE:

           My husband and I stand behind you, Govenor Palin, ref the firing of the commission of
           public safety. I suspect AST is not happy with you over cutting their budget and all this
           info they are dragging out and releasing to the press is sour grapes. Wish they would get
           back to their jobs and quit cry babying.
