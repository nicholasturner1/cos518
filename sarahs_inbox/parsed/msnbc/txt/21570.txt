           Ok boss, Pat and I are getting nervous that you haven't responded or provided any
           feedback.  If you don't like our approach, we can go back to the drawing board tonight.
           Tomorrow will be a busy day, though, and we want to get it in for Friday.

            her, it went a long way.

            I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the
            works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don't know if
            something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




           Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
           this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
           thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.
