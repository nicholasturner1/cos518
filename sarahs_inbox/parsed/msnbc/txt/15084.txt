            Dear Governor Palin,

              First, blessing to you and your family on your new            little addition!

              The business of the state that I'm concerned with at the moment is the funding request
            for the Alaska Zoo. The zoo desperately needs this financial help. Our zoo has become a
            wonderful asset to our state as I'm sure




                                                                 1




                                                                                                              PRA_GSP01_0017480
