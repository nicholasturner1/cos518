            Good on cspan . Anything national like that we should do.



            Lesil's bill will get a mention in next press availability - Annette can speak to
            insurance impacts too ? Maybe Karleen ?privileged or Personal Mat Privileged or Personal

            Governor-



            CSPAN would like to know if you would be interested in call-in show on public policy
            Sunday, February 24 at 7 a.m. Do you any thoughts on this either way? - we turned them
            down last year.




            Also, do you have any thoughts on the well baby exam coverage issue? Senator McGuire is
            working on a bill. It's not worth an entire press event but maybe a mention?
