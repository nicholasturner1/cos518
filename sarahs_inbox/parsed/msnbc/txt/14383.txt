             Sorry - I thought I had described the contents better - just an FYI that we have responded
             to the criticism of Commissioner Schmidt, letting the union know current tactics need to
             stop.  just wanted you to know that there has been a response and if it continues, I will
             file an ULP. Just trying to hit the highlights for you, rather than the details.

             I can't read it- but I certainly support you filing an unfair labor practice measure if
             they're messing with Joe and his ability to do his job in protecting Alaskans.

             Governor & Mike:

             I know you usually are viewing emails through your blackberry - so the

             gist of the attachment is advising ACOA that its actions with regard to

             Commissioner Schmidt bring it close to unfair labor practices. If it

                                                                 1

             doesn't cease ,   I will- file an unfair labor practice .     This letter is

             signed by the Division Director , but if I file an ULP , I will sign it,

             ratcheting up the response .      Commissioner Schmidt has been provided a

             copy.
