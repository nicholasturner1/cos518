               Subject: Press Event for Fish Consumption Advisory

             Governor,
             We wanted to be sure you had a heads-up that DEC and HSS will be holding a joint press conference Monday
             morning to announce new consumption guidelines for Alaska fish. Basically, pregnant or nursing women,
             teenage girls, and children under twelve should limit consumption of sport-caught yelloweye rockfish, halibut, and
             lingcod to two meals per week. We have worked with the agencies to be sure they emphasize the overall positive
             message about the health benefits of Alaska's fish while providing the necessary information to the public about
             recommended consumption limits for certain species. We have also held meetings with fishing industry
             representatives to give them advance notice of the announcement.
             Cora
