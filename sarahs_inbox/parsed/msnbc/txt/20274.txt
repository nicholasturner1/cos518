          Subject:                 Pt.Hope


          Press has reported numerous       times that Pt Hope folks wrote me a letter a couple of weeks
          ago re: the wanton waste of       caribou-.. I still have not seen that letter, pls track it
          down and let me know status       of the issue. It was front page and I still haven't heard
          anythig about it internally       yet. (Maybe DPS has the issue and letter in its shop?)
