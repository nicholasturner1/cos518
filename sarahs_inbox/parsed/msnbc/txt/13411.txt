               What cleaning products are used in the Governor's Mansion?

               Especially any that are sprayed?

                   Maybe it is NOT a genetic issue, but a chemical exposure that damages our child's genes?

                Since Celiac Disease & Thyroid autoimmune issues are prevalent for the Down's Syndrome

                http·//www valdezlink com/re/celiacdiseaseanddownsyndrome hbn

                I wonder about whether or not Down's Syndrome itself could happen because of a
                malfunctioning immune system? ... that EGBE exposure would cause? ... sniffles, flatulence,
                diarrhea, 'flu' are what exposure looks like.

                If so, I think glyconutrients should be checked into for good nutrition for mom and baby

               My theory is as relevant as any others

               & there is proof that Ethylene Glycol Monobutyl Ether is the harm to Gulf War Vets
               & that they look like civilians with CFIDS
