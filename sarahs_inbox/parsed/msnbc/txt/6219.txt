           Hello Governor,



           You're welcome!      No problem, we'll round up one of the coffee makers.



           That's exciting that you're having lunch with Michael W. Smith and his family! :)



           Erika

           Thanks!  Also, would u remind me to pack one of the small coffee makers for my Michigan
           and DC trip that I leave for on Wednesday. I think they're in the guest rooms closet.

          Hello Governor,

          The account at Alaska Cleaners is AK43254 and titled Office of the Governor.     if
          additional staff or family members need to be added to the account, please let me know.
          The account is good at all of their Anchorage and Wasilla locations.

          I really look forward to seeing you and Willow! Piper has an open TA to return to Juneau,
          and there are picnics scheduled in Anchorage to process another TA.  Just a thought...



          Have a great weekend!

          Erika



          Hi Kris,

          Please have someone collect the receipts and send them to the House, as they're paid
          through that account.  If there are any problems, please let me know right away so we can
          work them out.
