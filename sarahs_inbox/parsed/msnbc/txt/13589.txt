              Just spoke with Wesley Loy about the special message email. He is going to do a story on this later
              this afternoon. I let him know that it is government's job to inform Alaskans on issues that can
              have an impact on them. I reiterated that this is nothing new, previous administrations have done
              it, lawmakers send out newsletters, agencies send out newsletters to constituents etc etc. I asked
              him - what's the difference if the Governor holds a news conference or goes on a radio show to
              push what she feels is important? Wesley wants to ask Mike Nizich about what specific examples
              from previous administrations. He also wants to know if he can have access to the lists. He is going
              to call me later when he starts writing the email story. BTW- he admitted he was a hothead to Mike
              last night and apologized.

              In the meantime- he is also working on a budget story for tomorrow and wants to know if anyone
              wants to comment.
