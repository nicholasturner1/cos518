               Governor and Mike(s):

               Late yesterday evening the Board of Game approved a predator control program for the South Alaska Peninsula
               Caribou Herd which will entail the use of helicopter access by state employees to control wolf predation of newly-
               born calves on the calving grounds . A draft, but likely to be issued soon , news release (SAP NR) is attached for
               your information . Also attached is the regulatory package approved by the Board of Game.

               This will likely hit the press this afternoon.

               FYI, DL.
