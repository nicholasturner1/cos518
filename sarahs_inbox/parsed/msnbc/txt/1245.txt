MESSAGE:

As the mother of a beautiful daughter who has Down's Syndrome, let me offer my congratulations on
your being blessed with such a child. Prepare yourself for a lot of joy.



My Claire is 34 years old, can read and write, does her own banking and pays her own bills. She is
the joy of my life and the reason I do not have "empty nest syndrome."



My only criticism is that you should have had him in Texas. :1)



Love, peace and joy,

Gem Bordages
