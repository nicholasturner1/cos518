  Subject: North Pacific Fishery Management Council

Tibbles and Nzich,

Mr. Merrigan was appointed to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council . In cases of Federal boards, it
seems as though it would be more difficult to remove members because of the Congressional confirmation that is
needed . Please advise if you would like me to pull out any new applications that have come in for the Council.

Thank you for your time.
