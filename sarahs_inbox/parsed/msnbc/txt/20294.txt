         Governor - I    just received an email from Tim (Hillsdale College) - they are requesting a
         text copy of    the talk that you gave on Board the Regent Seven Seas Mariner on Saturday,
         August 2. Is    this something that you want to give them? The copy I have is the one that
         Kate emailed    to you - but I think you had made some changes. Janice
