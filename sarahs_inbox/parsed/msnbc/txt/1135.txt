MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palm,



Congratulations on the birth of your son! I am sure he is beautiful and wonderful. You are right - God
gives us children as a gift and each is special and has a special purpose. I will pray for your family as
you discover Trig's purpose, and as you face his challenges and celebrate his triumphs.



God bless Trig and your family,



Rose Beebe

Sioux Falls, SD
