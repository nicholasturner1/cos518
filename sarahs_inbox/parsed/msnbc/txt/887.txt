Thanks Sharon. I'm glad he corrected this one but he is still lying when he says his other posts have
been "spot on". Oh well, trying to correct all his lies would be a full-time job. :)

Subject: Feb 21: Retraction and apology



                                                     1                                     ROSTON 01532




Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
This afternoon we posted two different emails from sources associated with the dairy industry and
Matanuska Maid who informed us that a State's Assistant District Attorney resigned over improper
conduct with regards to the Creamery Board.



We have since been told the attorney did not resign.



Governor Palin's Deputy Press Secretary sent us this email at 1:33pm.



"Tina Otto, Assistant Attorney General for the State of Alaska, has not resigned. The Creamery
Corporation has its own private counsel who continues to represent the corporation."



We sincerely apologize for printing these emails which were not correct.



In the past we have been fairly liberal about publishing emails from our sources at Matanuska Maid
because they have always been spot on.



Regardless, we take full responsibility for the posting and assure our readers that in the future we will
no longer publish raw emails on any subject.



While there is a fine line on blogs between opinion and fact, we strive to make sure our readers
clearly understand where that line is with every blog.



We failed your trust today and we apologize.



Andrew
