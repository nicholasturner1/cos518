             Sounds like The Bristol rumor was started and continues via Lyda ' s office . ( Namely , Portia
             Babcock - Lyda's COS , Tuckerman ' s sister ( Tuckerman being Lyda ' s new son - in-law), former
             spouse of Kyle Parker ( the oil / gas lobbyist busted for working with Ruedrich while at
             AOGCC ), now girlfriend of Ralph Samuels ... all those attributes all rolled into one
             Portia.



             Anyway, a former leg staffer heard the discussion at a rest, in Wasilla , evidently sitting
             near Lyda's people ... she passed it on again today to folks at my sister ' s church ... it's
             pretty pathetic.



             Bristol does want it squashed - we just don ' t know how to do so without making it a bigger
             issue . Can you feel out Wesley and McAllister to see if that ' s where they got the rumor,
             as others are saying it's Lyda ' s office . I figured it was them or Bitney.

            We'll get it taken care of, don ' t worry.

            Diana Straub heard it and let Molly         know today in church . I can gurantee Diana heard it
            from the horses mouth or the horses         office - she and Janey. are pretty friendly. When
            confronted lyda won't be able to do         anything but apologize for her staff . How unbecoming
            and embarrassing for her office esp         when press start inquiring...

            Flippin unbelievable . Wouldn't you think they ' d be afraid of being proved wrong when they
            rumor around the building like that ? I wonder if Wesley and McAllister did hear it from
            Lyda's office though ... hopefully it'll be another reason why reporters and the public
            can't trust that odd group of strange people.

            I was just on the phone w Don and he got a call from Chuck Sr. Reports from Juneau that
            lyda ' s office is perpetuating the Bristol being pregnant rumor . No doubt Janey and/or
            Portia . I'm callin them on the flippin carpet!
