          MESSAGE:

          Sarah,

          It was nice to see you at the Nordstrom's fashion show for the Dare to Care fundraiser! I
          wanted to follow up on the offer to attend the Eva Foundation Christmas Tree Elegance Gala
          November 30th 6:30pm at the Sheraton Hotel Ballroom. I would like for you to speak at the
          event and kindly request a donation item for either a live or silent auction.

          I will send some information as well.

          Thanks!

          Kari Hall
