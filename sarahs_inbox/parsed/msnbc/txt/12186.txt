                 Keep up the great work . CP and the professional politicians are having a big problem dealing with an
                 honest Governor/person . My friends, who are your friends , believe you will succeed.

                 None of us are perfect ; so don ' t feel down on yourself if sometimes you make a mistake or miss-step.
                 WE ALL DO!

                 God Bless
