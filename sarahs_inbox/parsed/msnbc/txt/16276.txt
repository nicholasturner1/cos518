              Great idea- as jim Clark used to write many op-eds under his own name! Pls run that by
              him.

               Very unfortunate they don ' t understand these points . Doubt theyd let me do another op-ed
              so soon after my last one, but Steve sure could- or someone else could anyway. Maybe even
              a legislator?

             Sharon:



             Just a quick note, the ADN criticizes the Governor ' s plan to provide checks to Alaskans
            because it is not need based.



             ADN is off base for 3 reasons:



             1.  This is sharing a one -time special payment with Alaskans. Since all Alaskans share
            the state ' s resources and wealth equally, ( No one person owns more or less ) it is only
            fair that the one -time special payment provide each Alaskan the same amount.



             2.  ADN ignores the fact that there are already a number of programs to benefit low
            income Alaskans or Alaskans living in rural areas. These Alaskans can "stack " their PCE
            and LIHEAP and any other federal or state program , and any programs offered by their
            utilities ( Such as AEL&P ' s levelized billing - spreading payments out over 12 months at an
            even level instead of high payments in the winter ) that are targeted directly at low
            income ratepayers , on top of this one - time special payment if they choose to do so. (65%
            in the KTUU poll said they would choose to use the payment for energy costs)
