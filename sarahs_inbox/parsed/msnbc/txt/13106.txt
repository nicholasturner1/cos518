               Governor,
               I will let you know when my meeting's with the Security Staff has been completed. I plan on meeting with each of
               them separately to discuss our plan going forward probably beginning of next week and to address any questions
               or concerns they may have about personnel processing, timing of separation, etc.
               Mike
