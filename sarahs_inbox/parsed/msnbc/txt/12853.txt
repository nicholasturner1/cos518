                  Subject : Mat-Su Ferry issue on location of terminal in Anchorage / Rail extension funding

                Governor:

                I would like to follow up with week with Joe Perkins on the comments that the USCG will not issue a permit for
                placing the terminal at the Port where Mayor Begich wants it If that is the position of the USCG, I would like to
                get a letter from the Commander or person in charge of permitting that says as much . We could then attach that
                letter and possibly a letter from the Corps outlining the $5 million a year in dredging costs to our letter of support
                for the project to be built at Ship Creek . This would clearly show that Mayor Begich is being unreasonable.

                Mayor Menard invited me to attend the next mediation session with Senator Murkowski 's staff in Anchorage. If it
                is alright with you , I would like to attend . While there, I will also meet with central region DOT personnel and
                review a plat of the area to see if there are any other options nearby . (Although it sounds like the Mat-Su folks
                have already reviewed this, they may have missed something).

                On the rail extension to Port Mackenzie , it seems like a great project . I would like to check with the Railroad and
                find out why they are not putting any of the federal funding they receive each year into the project . (I think they
                average $50-60 million a year)

                Thanks,

                Randy
