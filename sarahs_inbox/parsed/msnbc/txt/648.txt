  Hi Sharon,

  Nice job in Valdez. ..just heard it live.

  Here's more to the story on Ruedrich asking Ben to step off the Nat' l committee . Bottom line is
  that per the ARP rules he can be removed for not attending meetings among other reasons.

  It sounds like someone along the way forwarded the info to Mike Ross who did the story, but
  FYI.

      The state Party absolutely CAN remove Stevens. It is the job of the state party NOT the
      national to do so. Chairman Ruedrich is disingenuous by saying it cannot be done. The
      state central committee should long ago have removed Stevens and even now should
      take the initiative to. do so. When Wayne Ross decided to run for Governor, he resigned
      and the state party replaced him. That was a function of the state party, not the national.

      Governor,

      It is true that National party rules do not provide for removal committee

                                                                                              ROSTON 00908

   members. This is because national rules leave it up to the individual state parties to
   devise the process for electing members (See rule 2
    http://www.gop.com/About/AboutRead.aspx?AboutType=4 ).
   According to Alaska Republican Party rules, state party officers can be removed and
   one reason for removal is failure to attend meetings
   (http://alaskarepublicans.com/rules.php ).

   Process for removal of ARP officer:

   ARTICLE X - REMOVAL FROM REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICE
   Section 1 : Grounds for Removal
   (c) Failure to attend, without sufficient reason for such absence, two consecutive regular and
   properly called meetings of the committee of which he is an officer or member.
   Section 2 : Who May File Charges
  Any registered Republican may file charges, provided proper grounds and reasons are submitted
  in writing. The charges shall be filed with the chairman of the committee of which the person
  charged is a member. If the person so charged is a chairman, the charges shall be filed with the
  vice-chairman who will preside at the hearing.

   It may be argued that the National Committeeman and National Committeewoman are
   not ARP officers, but National officers.

  Article 5, Section 14 (a) refers specifically to only 4 RPA officers, and 14(c) says the
  NCM/NCW are elected to represent ARP, but does not specifically call them officers.

  Article 5 Section 4(a) also mentions ARP officers and NCM/NCW separately, as if they
  are not the same thing.

   However, Article 9, Section 4(d) refers to 6 ARP statewide elected officers. This must
   include the 4 mentioned above and the NCM and NCW as these are the only 6
   positions elected in state convention.

  If the NCM is not an ARP officer, it begs the question what 6 positions are considered
  officers?

  ARTICLE V - STATE CONVENTIONS
  Section 4: Purpose of the Regular State Convention
  The purpose of the Regular State Convention shall include, but not be limited to:
  (a) Elect ARP officers or a National Committeeman and a National Committeewoman as per the
  ARP rules.
  Section 14: Election and Appointment of Republican Party Officers
  (a) During off presidential election years, the state convention shall elect the following RPA
  officers for four (4) year terms:
          (1) State Chairman
         (2) State Vice-Chairman
         (3) State Secretary
         (4) Assistant State Secretary
  (b) The State Treasurer, State Legal Counsel, State Parliamentarian, State Finance Chairman,
  seven (7) Regional Finance Chairmen and Assistant State Treasurer shall be appointed by the
  State Chairman and approved by an SCC majority at the SCC meeting immediately after the
  State Convention. The State Treasurer and Assistant State Treasurer shall be technically well

   experienced in accounting.
   (c) During presidential election years, the state convention shall elect one National
   Committeeman and one National Committeewoman who shall represent the ARP as members of
   the RNC for a four (4) year term.
   ARTICLE IX - GENERAL POLICIES
   Section 4: Support of Presidential & Primary Candidates.


   (d) Any SCC member, except the six APR statewide elected officers and the ARP Counsel, may
   support and publicly advocate the candidacy of the statewide Republican candidate prior to the
   primary election.

   I hope this helps.
