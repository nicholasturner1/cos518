          MESSAGE:

          I don't have much to say really. I just learned about Madame Governor via a weblog that
          mentioned her name as a possible VP choice for the GOP in 2008. After reading about her
          career & bio, I can only say, faster, please.



          Keep up the good work Mme. Governor. I hope that if you have the interest, and the people
          of Alaska can part with you, that we see you on the national stage very soon. You are a
          bona fide "rock star" in waiting for the GOP.



          All my best,
