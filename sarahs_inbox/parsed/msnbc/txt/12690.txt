            U can use my quote for Shelia, Sharon. As Shelia needs to know we're not conducting biz as
            usual in the Gov's House.

            I'll let Todd and Erika explain about how the Foundation worked it- and as far as I know
            there were zero lobbyists there...



           "This family-oriented superbowl fundraiser for the historical Foundation took the place of
           the former cocktail receptions and CBC receptions that used to be so common in the Gov's
           Mansion." Thanks!

           From Sheila Toomey -



           I've got an Ear item that says people were invited to watch the Super Bowl with Sarah and
                                                                     1

            Todd in return for contributions to a fund to redo the mansion . The complaint was that
            those invited were lobbyists , in apparent violation of the gov's ban (?) on lobbyists on
            the 3rd floor.????
