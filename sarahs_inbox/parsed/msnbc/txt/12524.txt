                Dear Governor Palin,
                    Attached is a cover letter that was sent to all legislators & the supporting comparison document
                concerning the consequences of SB 240, HB 273 & your recommendation for education funding as it
                applies to Valdez City School District FY09 funding. A BSA increase of either $100.00 or $200.00 causes
                a deficit budget for FY09. Your consideration of the impact of education funding to our district is
                appreciated.
                          Sincerely,
                                      Duane F. Edelman
                                      Valdez City School District
                                      Board Vice-President
