        Good morning,



        The Board of Ed chose to have a nationwide search . They had one the last time the
        commissioner ' s position needed to be filled as well.



        The commissioner ' s office sent me the timeline which I will forward to you in a separate
        email . Right now, they are looking at having face to face interviews with the finalists on
        July 30 , at which point they will have a meeting with you to meet and approve their
        candidate .  This appointment does not need legislative confirmation.



        If there are people that you want to have considered , please have them submit their
        applications to the Board.



        Lynne

         Hi guys!



         Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



         Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name ( s)    to me for selection ,     then on to the
         legislature for confirmation.



         We need innovation in that seat . Both your names brought forward are great . Not sure why
         Ed Bd thinks it needs a nationwide search, which I heard recently . I'll ask Lynne Smith to
         check the status on that and ask what my input is worth in terms of their method of
         soliciting names.



         Thank you guys . You're awesome . Keep up the great work - I miss ( six months later) our
         of rag-tag team of hardcore workerbees. Maybe the crew can get together for a shin dig
         soon?  I know Kris and Todd miss the campaign folks too . Six months zipped by - I'd love
         for us all together . Don Benson , Mark Fish ,. Perdews , Mary, etc , all of us!
