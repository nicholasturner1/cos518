               Governor,

               Just a note to let you know that I and my staff (Anchorage and Juneau) underwent an ethics refresher course
               today with a specific focus on maintaining separation between the Office of the Lieutenant Governor and the
               campaign . We'll continue to maintain that separation required by law and the public trust, and as previous
               lieutenant governors and other elected officials have done when they have run for office while being in office.

               Regards,

               Sean
