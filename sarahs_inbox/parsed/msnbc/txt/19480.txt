           We can skip the lunch also . It's a prospecting lunch and only Perry and Barbour will be
           there making a pitch.

           I'll show u other scheduling blunders she gave me that have added to frustrations because
           precious time gets wasted. I'll also be asking her if she feels overwhelmed or not free to
           delegate, so that these things don't continually happen. She must let go of some of this
           and allow others in the 20,000-plus employee corps to help me out.

            Just an FYI, the RGA event times on the calendar are wrong, the event locations are
           wrong, apparently they changed this morning's breakfast from open to 'executive committee
           only' which was embarassing for me finding out so late and it was not necessary for the
           Gov to attend. Christie said she emailed you the updated schedule and briefing on Thursday
           - did you get it from her? If not, let me know so that I can address it with them if we're
           not getting what we need. My fault that I didn't realize until too late that there was no
           briefing info..
