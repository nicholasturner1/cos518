            No, I mean I'd rather he and Tara and others come over to the house tonight instead of
            having that mtg today in the middle of a very busy time. They can come over, meet
            officially, and save valuable office time that I need today. Thanks



            I'm giving Erika a head's up that I'll be inviting them to come over tonight.
