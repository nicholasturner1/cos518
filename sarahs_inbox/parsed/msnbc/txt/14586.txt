             He said it wasn ' t his area , or something to that effect.

             BUT, there IS good     news from Russ . The bills we are waiting on for this week's bill
             signing events may     be on their way to us. Lyda is in Texas and apparently she has signed
             them ( SB 209 , 243,   101 dealing with older Americans and I think some others , too -- think
            .Purple Heart Trail     bill which we need by Saturday ). Lyda is sending them. They MAY be here
             by Thursday ' s bill   signing - but might not make it. We ' ll keep tracking it. But the
             Saturday bill will     probably be here in time.

             Pls ask her. Tho it's unacceptable that Russ doesn't answer it.

             I just called Russ and he said to ask Karen your question below -- that

             she handles that. I will follow up with Karen.

            NOTE: FYI, he told me that all of them - Russ, Karen, Mike T. -- were

            perplexed with your questioning of them late Friday night via email. He

            said there are things we have no control over -- like when we get the

            budget. They can give it to us at the same time as the special session

            and we can't do anything about it.

            First we have to make sure COS and Russ asked, gave definitive timeline,

            was refused by which lawmakers, etc. We need backup paper trail for all

            that be we know lyda and harris will claim we didn't "communicate" any

            of this to them.
