  Hi Todd,
  These instructions will give you access to view the Governor's schedule from any computer. I check it on
  a daily basis, as appointments, etc.. are added and deleted frequently. Kami is working on getting access
  to the calendar from your Blackberry.
  I really don't mind sending the calendar information to you, but this will be much easier for you!
