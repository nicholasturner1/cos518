                  Subject: Pred Control OpEd To Run Tomorrow
                  I'm happy to report that your OpEd on predator control is scheduled to run in tomorrow's
                  (Friday, Feb. 15) edition of The Hill.
                  It will run in the print edition and be posted online (www.TheHill.com)

                 This is the audience that we were hoping to reach with this piece.

                 Background from the website: The Hill is known among those who influence policy as a
                 "must read" in print and online. It signals the important issues of the moment. In an
                 environment filled with political agendas, The Hill stands alone in delivering solid, non-
                 partisan and objective reporting on the business of Washington, covering the inner-
                 workings of Congress, as well as the nexus between politics and business. The Hill
                 serves to connect the players, define the issues and influence the way Washington's
                 decision makers view the debate. The Hill has a print circulation of above 21,000, more
                 than any other Capitol Hill publication. It is aimed at the 100 senators, 435 House
                 members, 40, 000 aides and tens of thousands in the influence industry whose work
                 affects the lives of all Americans.
