               Governor - I received a phone call from Nelson Garrett w/ Garrett's Tesoro in Anchorage . He's inviting the
               Governor to come out to Garretts Tesoro Monday , 09.01 © 2:00pm and help change the price of gas on their
               signs. The price is going down 8 cents and Channel 13 will be there.

               I let Mr. Garrett know that you would be in travel status on that date . He just wanted to relay that his truckers are
               so happy as every little bit helps. Janice
