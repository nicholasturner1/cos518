          MESSAGE:

          Although I've been a lifelong Republican, I didn't know anything about you until I heard
          Sean Hannity tell the story about your son Trig. Everything I've read about you since,
          tells me that you are a model of what I've always believed a Republican should stand for.



          This marks the first year since 1972 that I have seriously thought about sitting out a
          presidential election. Several of Sen. McCain's positions trouble me , particularly his
          stance on Cap & Trade and his unwillingness to drill for oil in ANWR and off our coasts.



          The bottom line for me, I've decided, is that I won't be making my modest financial
          contributions to the RNC and may not even vote, unless McCain picks an outstanding VP
          running mate. I think you, by far, would be his best choice. I hope he has the sense to
          ask you and that you would be willing to run.



          In any event, I wish you and your family the best, and I'm sure some day, if you want to
          be, you'll be a major force in national politics.



          Sincerely,



          Bill Marsden
