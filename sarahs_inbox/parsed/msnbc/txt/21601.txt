             Governor,




             State Supreme Court decision 3-2 holds the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional.




             There are 40 states that currently have parental involvement laws

             There are 26 states that currently have parental consent laws

             There are 3 states that have ruled them unconstitutional:

             California

             Florida

             and now Alaska


            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             More info including the actual ruling are coming, but shall we have Talis work with Mike
             and Sharon on an appropriate response?



             F

              Frank,



                          The Governor should be told that this morning the Alaska Supreme Court issued
             a decision in the Parental Consent case. The Court by a 3-2 majority, in an opinion
             written by Justice Dana Fabe, held the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional. I am
             the attorney for the State of Alaska in this case and I will be happy to brief anyone on
             this ruling.



             Kevin

            The Supreme Court has issued a decision today in the parental consent for abortion case.
            The state lost, 3-2, with a long dissent. Kevin Clarkson is going to email me the
            decision and a summary. The decision is embargoed until 12:30 today.
