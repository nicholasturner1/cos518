             Sharon- who all is on our media press release recepient list? I'd like to see who
             received, for example, yesterday' s presser we sent out right before 5pm re: Conoco's
             response.



             There's something odd about a very vocal critic of our press releases and speeches - the
             person must receive the pressers before the general public sees them - because this critic
             posts them and spins our content into something negative everytime... and they're able to
             do this before the presser even gets printed or reported on in the mainstream media.
             Thanks
