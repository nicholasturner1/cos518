Governor Palin:



Just a quick note to wish you much love and happiness with your precious new son Trig. We too are
blessed to have a son who is now 7 with Down Syndrome. We adopted him at 7 weeks old after he
battled meningitis at three days old. God called us to a ministry of adopting special needs children.
Micah...like your Trig is our fifth child. God let us in on his greatest secret when he allowed us to
adopt this precious child. I am so thankful we were obedient to heed the call. Welcome to the
adventure!!! Congratulations.
