             Gotcha.

            By the way, we just looked into my sister's divorce court records- it's confirmed there
            that neither the Palin or Heath family ever filed even a single complaint against Trooper
            Wooten. And that it was four days ago that Wooten refused to return kids over after a
            visitation, his sargeant had to call him to tell him to obey the court order, so he
            returned the kids with this threat: "Get ready for the show. I will bring you and your
            family down". Then, four days later he riles up the union and they hold the press
            conference. (Which is proof that Walt's dismissal had nothing to do with Trooper Wooten.
            Wooten orchestrated all this today.)

             If I can sneak away from Trig at that time... how about I email you as early as possible
            tomorrow, before I'd leave for Anchorage?
