  Who's Sarah Palin ? She's Hot where He's Not




  Forget regional balance and those white guys in suits. Alaska's young, hot, Vogue-posing, female Republican
  governor could become the popular favorite to be Sen. John McCain's running mate.

  Named by Alaska Magazine as "America's Hottest Governor," Palin (pronounced Pay-lin) is getting big buzz in
  the conservative press and talk radio. Fans have a "Draft Sarah Palin" movement. What better balance for the
  71-year-old nominee who could be facing a 46-year-old phenomenon?

 A former athlete and beauty queen, Palin's approval ratings hover in 90 percent zone. Take that Barack. She
 was born in 1964 (1936 for McCain) and has four kids named Bristol, Piper, Track, and Willow. She could win
 Marin County on that alone. Plus a handsome fisherman hubby known as "First Dude."

 Palin became a public hero taking on special interests, who practically own the Alaska political establishment.
 Forced to resign from the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission after complaining to Republican Gov.
 Frank Murkowski about corruption, she was banished to the political wilderness before coming back to defeat
 Murkowski in the GOP primary.

 Palin forced the Alaska legislature into special session to increase oil taxes -- yes, that's oil taxes -- in Alaska, a
 Republican welfare state. And she vetoes public works projects.

 Conservative Weekly Standard pundit Fred Barnes flew up to Alaska to check her out. The magazine thinks her
 "relative youth and short tenure in office" may hurt her chances. Since when?

 Her office says she has not been contacted by anyone for the job and has her hands full in Alaska.
