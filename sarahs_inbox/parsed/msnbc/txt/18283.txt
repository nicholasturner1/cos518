        Dear Mr. Holmstrom:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.




        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        When I first heard that you had vetoed Anchorage Community Theatre's request for funding,

         I was a bit miffed.

         Then I remembered that I had voted for you and even put out a yard sign to make sure you
         were elected.

         Alaska's oldest theater company deserves some support, but you are doing the right thing.

         Thanks, Gov,
