              Thanks Randy. Let's find out if ARM did do that resolution.

              Subject: Preparation and roll-out related to filing of lawsuit against Mercer




              Sharon:




              I spoke with Mike Barnhill, the lead attorney at LAW on the case against Mercer, the
              former actuary for the PERS / TERS plans.



              Mike said that tomorrow, Commissioner Kreitzer; local counsel, Mike Lessmeier; and he will
              start informing legislators in leadership of the state's intent to file the complaint
              against Mercer. (The last I had heard, the complaint should be ready to be filed in the
              next 10-14 days) I believe the complaint will seek recovery from Mercer of up to $1.8
              billion in damages.



              Here is the schedule for the legislative briefings:




              Tuesday, November 20, 2007




              Speaker John Harris

              Finance Co-Chair Kevin Meyer
                                                                      1




                                                                                                                      PRA_GSP01_0008008

               Wednesday , November 21, 2007




               Senate President Lyda Green

               Possibly Senate Finance Co-Chair Bert Stedman



               Week of Nov. 26, 2007




              Minority Leadership - Representative Kerttula, Senator Gary Wilken, Representative Gara
              will be briefed the following week.



              I believe Mike Barnhill is going to take the first try at drafting a press release that
              could be sent out the day the complaint is filed with the court. Please work directly
              with Mike on that issue.



              We may want to note in the press release that the litigation is supported by the ARM
              Board . (I believe they passed a resolution supporting the litigation).



              Randy
