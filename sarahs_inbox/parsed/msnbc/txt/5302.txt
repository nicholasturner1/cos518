                  You bet, Meg. Whatever you need I will manage . I'll have it to you tomorrow night (though I fear it will be
                  late night). Also, if you could give me a call this afternoon sometime , I would appreciate it so we could
                  coordinate various outreach efforts in the near and further terms.
                  Thanks,
                  Bruce

                 I know that this is the worst week in the world for you , but I'd like to make sure this week 's briefing is the
                 Compass piece in the ADN on Saturday . For that to happen , would really need to have the piece by
                 tomorrow night so that we can forward it Wednesday.
                  Please let me know if this is an option.

                 Thanks,
                 Meg
