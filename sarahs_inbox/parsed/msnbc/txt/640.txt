Governor, the figures are state expenditures only. The Inaugural Committee reimbursed us for
additional expenses relating to the inaugural balls that the state would not have paid for -- the total
reimbursement was $4,007.20.



I do not have the records for other money spent by the Inaugural Committee or money spent by the
Palin family.

Linda: Do these figures account for the Inaugural Committee and Palin family paying for travels?

Very preliminary information relating to prior administrations comparisons... we are still working
through documents to sort out the travel information, including the public safety billings for flight
charges. The preliminary travel costs reflected here are for per diem reimbursements and
commercial transportation expenditures only.



Governor Palin days out of Juneau since taking office through 9/4/2007 are 173.



The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this travel is
$28,446.46 **NOTE: does not yet include public safety charges for any King Air Travel.



Governor Murkowski's comparable timeframe comparison:

Days out of Juneau from taking office through 8/24/2003 was 124.



The commercial transportation, lodging and per diem paid in conjunction with this travel was
$18,553.32 **NOTE: no public safety charges yet included.. Governor Murkowski only had two trips
with commercial airfare costs within this timeframe. There will be considerably more costs when the
flight logs and billings are calculated.



Prior administrations annual travel by calendar year without the public safety billing information:

Good evening Governor,



I've attached very PRELIMINARY information regarding our current costs

as compared to prior administrations as requested in prior emails. We

are still working through travel documents and will need to go through

flight logs and public safety billings to obtain complete information.

I hope to provide the full scenario by mid-week. We will also provide

more detailed travel scenarios specific to Anchorage travel and costs

that I believe will provide a more accurate comparison between the

administrations.



I apologize again for the delay Governor, but we still have a

If you think of any additional area of comparison, please let me know.



Thank you,

How close are we to having the numbers showing #of days former Gov(s)

spent out of Juneau compared to my travels/housing expenses? The public

deserves clarity on this as the misperception is I'm "living and

working" in the Valley. If, as Security and administrators tell me, Murk

and Knowles also worked out of the Anchorage office and spent many, many

days out of Juneau - then the fair comparison needs to be made and

presented. The other missing point in the coverage of this issue is that

the Anchorage office is the workplace.



When I requested this info a couple of weeks ago I wasn't sure who was

heading it up - please let me know as soon as possible who is and what
