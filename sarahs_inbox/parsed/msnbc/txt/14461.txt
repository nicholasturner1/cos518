          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,

          I am just writing to congratulate your whole family on the birth of Trig! My husband and
          I have 5 children, the youngest has Down syndrome and she has been the most amazing
          blessing for all of us! God was so good to give her to us and so I truly celebrate with
          those who get to know this new world! It is one I wouldn't have chosen so I am thankful
          God did for me !

          Start stocking up on Veggietale DVDS and Signing Time DVDs! It is amazing how well
          language skills develop!

          Again, this is a fun world!   It may be Knottsberry Farm vs Disneyland at times ,               (a little
          slower paced ) but so much joy!

          God bless you

          The Thomas Family:

          Jim, Gaylene, Ty, Kyle, Cole, Kaya, and Alayna
