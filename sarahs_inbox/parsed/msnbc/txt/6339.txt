         MESSAGE:

         Governor Palin,



         Boy Scout Troop 557 will be conducting its first Eagle Scout Court of Honor on August 18,
         2007 in Bethel and would like to cordially invite you to attend and help in presenting the
         awards.



         Four Scouts, all original members of the troop, Edward Corp, Bryan Hildreth, Samuel Young
         and Patrick Brinich-Langlois will receive their Eagle Scout badges. Of the original 8
         boys that helped form Troop 557, a 50% success rate is a remarkable accomplishment and
         your presence would be an additional honor.



         I am the original scoutmaster of the Troop but now live and work in Wasilla and have been
         still an active member of the troop.



         Please let me know as soon as possible if you would be able to attend our Court of Honor.



         Sincerely



         Thomas A. Hildreth
                                                                 1
