            Talis- great job on explaining state position on tonight' s news . This is such a tough
            issue because emotions are high in these situations... I look forward to speaking to you
            further on this to try to figure out additional cooperative efforts we can take with local
            juristictions, which came across in tonight's report. Thank you
