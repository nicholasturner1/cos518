            Subject: Special Session Strategy




            Governor,




            Mike asked for an outline of the current thinking related to the special session.
            Attached is an outline of issues associated with getting the needed votes. It was put
            together by Joe with input from Kelly. Also attached is the current schedule for the
      i     session. The legislature is planning on hitting the road on June 11 and going to Fairbanks
                                                                   1




                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0018630

             in Juneau.




             Let us know if you have any questions, or would like a more thorough briefing.
