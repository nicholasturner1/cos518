        Holy moly, glen beigel sure turned on me. I dont know what i did to make him so disgusted.
        He played right into Fagan's hands on "broken campaign promises". Maybe he's mad that I
        didn't meet with him last week?

        Fyi. You got clobbered on Fagan's show as he (and Beigel) claim you led me to break "more
        campaign promises" be of bd of educ members and homeschool issue. But dont worry, i got
        the brunt of it. It was ugly.
