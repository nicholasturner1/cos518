              Governor,



              There was no work order for the tanning bed and no one here has discussed it with ADN or
              anyone else.  Did Gail at the AK Club say that she' d be discreet about your purchase?
              They knew it required a 220 outlet.



             We've had 3 electricians bid on the 220.  They agreed that it was a good thing to add more
             capacity to the third floor for future use and for the w/d I want moved up there after
             it's not needed for the plumbing project.



             The one bid in so far-

              $3500- cedar closet

              $3200-basement family room

             No bid too complicated for Todd's office.



             We're waiting for 2 other bids to come in.



             Erika

             There should be no work order to "install a sun bed", as this reporter claims there is.

              Erika- the press from ADN just called about the sun bed. Any idea where this would have
              come from?
