                 and data proving the state's fiscal stability.

                        Joe,

                        I assume you have your blackberry with you. Exxon CEO is slamming Alaska in their analyst meeting
                        right now. He said the state lacks fiscal stability and that a producer-owned line is still the best bet. I'm

                       not listening to the analyst call, but we do have someone there and I will fill you in later . Just thought
                       you might want to pass it along to the governor in case she wants to respond . Of course, you know this
                       is an escalating war of words that has Exxon ticked off. Give me a call when you 're free.
