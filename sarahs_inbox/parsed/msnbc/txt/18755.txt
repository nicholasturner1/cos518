          Mike- you're up on this controversy with Beigel and the emails I've sent Talis to let him
          know about it (and Beigel's request to talk to the AG about it)... Instead of Talis having
          to meet with him on it, pls call Seigel to find out his beef more thoroughly. Frank's been
          running interference here , I wanted to wrap up my comments on this in that final email I
          sent Seigel on Saturday before he went back on the air to "guess" about our position on
          homeschools ... Pls call him be it was your name mentioned as the guy who " steered me
          wrong", according to Beigel's rant on the Fagan show. Try that tactic before Talis spends
          any more time on this - Frank, too.
