                  Governor introduced by General Tinsley

                  Thank you, General, for that introduction, & also for allowing us to
                  kick-off our celebration of AK's 50th Anniversary of Statehood, as
                  well as 50 years of partnering with the U.S. Military here at.
                  Elmendorf Air Force Base! Good evening to you all, & thank you
                  for joining us tonight.

                  We are so proud to present this concert as a gift to AKns & to our
                  military, & thanks to tonight 's partners - the American Forces
                  Network, Pentagon Network , AT&T, & our local NBC syndicate,
                  KTUU - we are able to broadcast live to our military all across the
                  world.

                  And let's not forget one of our most important partners - Wynona
                  Judd! A great supporter of America's military, it is absolutely
                  thrilling to have her here with us to honor & thank our troops, & to
                  celebrate AK's statehood! I'll go ahead & hand the mic back to
                  Brigadier General Tinsley, so we can get this show on the road.
                  General?
