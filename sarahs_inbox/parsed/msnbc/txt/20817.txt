           Just so you know I have been calling the commissioners to stay on top of what's hot and
           what's not. With the exception of all the public info requests we are getting bombarded
           with we are staying on top of things. Hope things are good with you and I will let you
           know of important policy issues as they come up. It was good spending time with you on
           Friday.

           Hi guys! Checkin in. I anticipate folks will be inquiring about our polar bear issue,
           though it hasnt cropped up yet that I've heard of.

             Climate change is a top issue of course. Just head's up. Also, predator control's been
           quiet, but let me know if the issue's volume gets turned up and I need to respond to
           anything. Thanks guys! Hang in there... I appreciate you sincerely.
