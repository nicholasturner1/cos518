            MESSAGE:

            I just heard the news on KLove Christian Radio of the birth of your new son. As the
            parent of a special needs daughter I can vouch for the fact that they are a special
            blessing to our lives. I pray that everything goes well with the baby and that through
            his birth and life you and your family will grow stronger, even closer and more faith
            filled.  Below are the links to 2 stories that blessed me immensely while rearing my
            daughter who is now 23 years old. I hope they touch your heart as much as they did mine.
            God bless you and your family.
