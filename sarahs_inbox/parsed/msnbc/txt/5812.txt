            Subject: pt thomson
           Had I not read the AP wire on Pt Thomson tonight I would not have known that we extended
           Exxon's time to submit development plans. If I'm asked about it in tomorrow's press availability,
           I sure don't want to have to answer that I don't know why we extended... I need someone to shed
           light on this for me before tomorrow's reporters start asking questions.
