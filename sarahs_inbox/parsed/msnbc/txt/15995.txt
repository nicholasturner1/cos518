          Subject:                 Wesley- correction


          Ok- I had to finally read a blog (yuck!) be of comments I heard about wesley's account of
          the bear sighting in Juneau the other day.

          Sheeesh- nothing's changed since I stopped reading that ADN blog nearly two months ago!

          But Wesley does need to clarify that, NO, I was not looking for publicity- I did not
          approach him about seeing three bears by the mansion... he approached me about it after
          hearing that I was one of the crowd looking at the bears that morning and he asked me to
          comment!   Could he at least clarify that on the blog (without me having to admit to him
          that I actually spent the time reading his blog entry and the bloggers' replies). And I
          didn't put my kids in any danger, as the idiot blog comments claim.

          Now, remind me to not peek in again at that ridiculous media forum - it's the most
          unhealthy and idiotic forum imaginable. Hopefully others can do that for us and call
          people on the untruths and misperceptions they read there.
