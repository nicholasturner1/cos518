           MESSAGE:

           Please consider the Vice President position.              I think you could really make a difference.
           I know you have a loyalty



           to Alaska and a lot of unfinished business that you feel needs



           to addressed, but I suggest that the White House might not be the worst place to advance
           those needs.




           Truly Yours,



           Robert J. Glawe
