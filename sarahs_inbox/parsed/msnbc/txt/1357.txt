Hello Rhonda,



Please let me know what the itinerary is and what I need to take care of; if you already have your TA
filled out I can just duplicate your information for Todd's TA. Sounds like I need to take care of this
right away.



Thanks,

Erika

Great. I'm so glad there's a flight available on Saturday.



 There were seven seats left on Frontier Flying Service out of Anchorage early Friday afternoon so
you'll need to have yours booked ASAP.



Thanks,



Rhonda

 Rhonda,



        Called your office this a.m. Now I'm a step further. I've found two seats on a Frontier Charter
that leaves Galena at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. I know you folks have schedules that get a bit
complex and understand if I'm too late. Please know that we would welcome either or both of you.
The Yukon River broke here in Galena is and running full blast today. Jim

 Dear Rhonda,



        I felt very bad that connections prevent you folks from this visit. I can arrange transport to
Fairbanks via private pilot but I'm not sure what your comfort zone is in that regard. We've a huge
number of students headed home through this week. Of course there are graduates and families
loading the planes on Saturday. If you're interested in private pilot passage I can arrange it. Good
pilot. Thanks Jim

 Dear Rhonda,



        The graduation is at 7:00 pm this Friday night. We certainly can find night quarters for two
more if you can get out here. I can be reached at 907-656-1883, extension 107.       Jim

 Dear Rhonda,



        Just an up-date on Sidney Huntington. He's still with us and still "sharp as a tack". He
continues to have small seizures but has been honored my the visits from many of his grand children.
  He also received the citation I believe from the Governor delivered by the state troopers. It meant a
great deal to him and I hope you convey our appreciation to her. I'll keep you posted. Thank you
from Galena. Sincerely, Jim Smith
