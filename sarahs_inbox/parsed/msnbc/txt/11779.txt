           MESSAGE:

           I am writing to you to request your support in endorsing Mitt Rodney to receive the
           nomination for president of the U.S. I believe he is the most qualified for this position
           as well as upholding the princials of the Republican Party. I think he would make an
           excellent candidate to represent our party.
