           My understanding is that Leo forwarded the e-mail he received from you to SE Region
           Director Mal Menzies.  Apparently Mal then shared the e-mail chain with other DOT
           employees when he asked for their assistance in responding to the question about how much
           work was occurring on the Juneau Access project. While these DOT employees are the
           persons with the information Mal was trying to get back to Leo, they are also strong
           supporters of the project. I certainly do not know for sure, but I suspect it was one of
           these employees that leaked the e-mail.
