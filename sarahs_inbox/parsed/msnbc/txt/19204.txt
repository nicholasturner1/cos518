          Governor-

          1st - Have you read/approved the 2007 AST Annual Report to be made public?



          2nd - Via a soon-to-be-retiring legislator, we have received a complaint that had you
          driving with Trig not in an approved infant car seat; if so this would be awkward in many
          ways.



          Please know that I am trying to help...

          -Walt

             I apologize for the late hour. Here is the letter for Mary Glazier that I promised to re-send your way for approval. It
             should show up as an attachment, as well as in the body of the email. Once it has your approval, I'll format it and
             have it ready for Mary and her flight to Japan tomorrow.

           . Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you,

             Kate

             Yep- things would be getting way too tight with the travels in there.
             Do u mean the trip to Philly is $1800? Or to nevada?

             I've been searching flights and if you do Alaska Airlines the cost is approx. $1,800. If you By Northwest its
             considerably cheaper. We can put you out of ANC on Sunday or Monday depending on how long you want to be in
             NV. I was just trying to fit in the King Salmon bill signing that 1 thought we were trying to look at beforehand.

             Janice, if I'm reading the Nevada portion correct, she would leave Monday night and get into LV on Tuesday then
             departing for Philly on Weds. I would suggest a flight option that would get them in on Monday morning should
             they decide to go that route. Also AK flies direct there and it may be timelier and as cost effective to do it that
             way.. `???
