            MESSAGE:

            Hello from Petersburg, Governor Palin,



            I was hoping you are still in Juneau. Our daughter and her husband are gillnetting out of
            Juneau right now. You may recognize her name, Sara Stoner. She and her husband got the
            petition going for the fisherman's tax credit that's now being considered in Washington,
            DC_  It would be fun for her to meet you. She has similar features to you. We kid her
            that when you become Vice President, she can become Governor. :-)



            Her cell number is (907) 209-3095. Hope you can connect.



            Thank you for your time.



            Sincerely,



           Mrs. Dennis Jones
                                                                 1
