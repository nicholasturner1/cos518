              Kopp told us yesterday that no one has asked for the letter of reprimand that we did not know existed, thus no one in
              Admin (including me) has seen it.
                I do want to see it, he said he should be able to get Kenai to let me see it (well, I would think so!), so please ask
              again for it today.
                 Also, I was shocked to see the dispatcher (former) sent me an emailnearly two weeks ago and yet I was never
              given her message. In addition, all the other emails pertaining to the sexual harassment allegation that I had to ask
              for yesterday and they are now being compiled for me... it should be easy to figure out that these communications
              surrounding such a volitile issue should have been given to me without me having to hustle around trying to find out
              where they landed and to ask why they were not forwarded to me. Again, that email/communication system has got
              to change so I am not the last to know.
                Talis- let's talk again today in my office, I do a presser at 9:30, then Julie kitka (no subject known) at I lam. Then
              when you get a chance can you come over or I'll go to you. Please get Kopp's letter, and I'll speak with you more re:
              his APSC file that an ADN reporter asked him about yesterday.
