          MESSAGE:

          Governor Plain & ADFG:

          The topic of this e-mail is the Sea Otters in the Yakutat Bay area. First of all,
          introductions, I am originally from Yakutat, but live in Wasilla for work reasons. I know
          just about all the folks in the city of Yakutat. The good folks have mentioned over and
          over that the Sea Otter population is out of control.... they have noticed that all of the
          normal traditional foods (clams, crabs, mussels, sea urchin, herring eggs)are becoming very
          scarces.Their complaints/concerns about the Yakutat Bay Sea Otter situation, fell on deaf
          ears in the previous State Administration. Hopefully, your Adminstration is more attuned
          to the needs of subsistence users. This State controls the wolf numbers,in order to help
          manage their food source (moose), and this State controls the bison numbers, otherwise the
          bison would depleat their food source. Further; this State destroys whole islands of
          cattle,to protect bird nests ...so, why cann,t this State take control of the Sea Otter
          population to protect the Otte

          is nautral food source,and traditional subsistence food of the Yakutat' s people?
          Governor, if you really believe in the "subsistence issue ", don,t just let it be for the
          folks in the Umnak Island area.



          Sincerly,

          Bert Bremner
