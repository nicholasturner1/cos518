              MESSAGE:

              Dear Sarah,



              Congratulations on your election!           I knew when you were one of Howard ' s bosses at AOGCC
              that you would go

              far in politics, but I hardly expected to see you in the Governor' s Mansion so soon.




              I will be making my annual visit to Juneau with the PAX foreign                   exchange students March
              19-22. We usually

              make an appointment with the Governor and/or Lt. Governor while we are at the capitol.
              This year I

              wondered if you and your family would like to try something a little different. Would your
              daughters be

              interested in hosting the group for a pizza party at the Mansion?

                                                                        1



                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0000405

              This year I have ten students from Indonesia ( 2), Malaysia ,          Philippines ,    Ghana, Tajikistan,
              Turkmenistan,

              Armenia , Ukraine , and Russia . These students are currently attending high school in
              Anchorage . They are

              recipients of US State Department scholarships as part of its "citizen diplomacy"
              initiative.




              While in Juneau we will be staying at Schaible House, The Global Connections Club at UAS
              is planning a

              dinner for the group one of the evenings. We may also make a presentation to a history
              class at UAS. The

              students will also spend one day at the capitol visiting legislators and attending a floor
              session. If

              time and weather permit, we will visit Mendenhall Glacier and the Museum . The schedule is
              somewhat

              uncertain because we have to wait and see when there will be a floor session and then work
              around it.



              If Willow and Bristol       ( and Piper if she wants ) are interested in meeting the students,
              have them e-mail

              me. I know the students would love to hear what it is like to be the daughter of the
              Governor.



              Hoping to see you in Juneau,

                   2. NATURAL GAS: New Alaska pipeline plan includes $500M in
                  state matching funds
                  Ben Geman , E&ENews PM senior reporter

                  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) will offer a proposal to the state Legislature on Friday to spur development
                  of the state's natural gas pipeline that will include $500 million in state matching funds for early project
                  costs.

                  Palin, in Washington this week to promote the plan, said today the proposal could breathe new life into
                  long-stalled efforts to bring large North Slope natural gas reserves to markets in the lower 48 states.

                  Palin and a top aide said their plan would allow the state to begin soliciting pipeline proposals by this
                  summer. "We know we need to get off high center," Palin told reporters. "We need to progress this
                  project because there are hungry markets for Alaska's natural gas."

                  The project, once begun, will take an estimated 10 years before gas begins flowing.

                  The governor envisions an open solicitation for proposals, in contrast to former Gov. Frank Murkowski's
                  (R) negotiations with BP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips. Murkowski was unable to steer his
                  proposal through the state Legislature..

                  Palin previewed the bill and timeline she envisions today. Marty Rutherford, who heads Palin's gas
                  pipeline team, said the state hopes to distribute a request for applications by June or July, with a three-
                  month response period. They envision early fieldwork beginning in the summer of 2008. "It is a tight
                  time frame but we are pretty committed to it," Rutherford said.

                  They also discussed a host of incentives. aimed at reducing industry risks, as well requirements industry
                  must meet in return. The plan will include up to $500 million in state matching funds to help the
                  developers pay early costs such as design, engineering and environmental analysis work to obtain
                  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval for the project.

                 Beyond the $500 million, the bill includes other incentives for both pipeline developers and Alaska gas
                 producers.

                 Providing predictable royalty rates

                 Rutherford said one of the upstream incentives would be changes to state oil and gas lease provisions to
                 provide what Rutherford called more predictability in how royalty rates are determined. "Right now it is
                 a rather complicated formula. We are willing to change that formula to be more certain for producers
                 who commit their gas into this project," she said.

                  from greenwire this afternoon                                                                     Page 2 of 3


                  The plan would also provide additional tax incentives for producers that commit to supplying gas during
                  the first "open season," the period in which pipeline developers solicit commitments to supply gas to the
                  line.

                  The state would provide, for 10 years, a tax credit equal to any differences between tax rates in place
                  during the first open season and any increases imposed by the Legislature, Palin said. "We want to
                  ensure your profitability is insured for approximately 10 years as it relates to the state production tax,"
                  she said.

                  Another aspect of the proposal, Palin said, will be provisions aimed at ensuring the project can be
                  expanded to allow new gas produced to be added later. She said this was needed to tap future supplies
                  beyond 35 trillion cubic feet of reserves that producers currently hold.

                  Palin and Rutherford also said developers will have to. provide "timelines and benchmarks" for applying
                  for federal approval and presenting budgets. Palin said the prior negotiations suffered from a lack of
                  certainty.

                  The state will include five gas off-take points to help provide for state energy needs. Palin said the plan
                  would provide "a more secure United States and more robust economy for the state of Alaska and
                  ultimately for the nation." The plan also addresses work force issues, such as steps to provide jobs to
                  Alaskans on the massive project.

                  Palin has been meeting federal officials and the state's congressional delegation to promote the
                  forthcoming proposal.

                  'Very interesting'

                  An aide to Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said the senator is behind Palin and hopes the plan works.
                  Stevens' office also provided a transcript of a brief interview Stevens gave to Alaska Public Radio
                  yesterday, in which he called the idea of the state providing up to $500 million in up front funding "very
                  interesting."

                 Palin met Monday with FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher. "We talked about her efforts on the Alaska
                 natural gas pipeline, which I believe represent the best hope for building a pipeline to bring Alaska's vast
                 natural gas resources to the energy-consuming lower 48 states," he said in a prepared statement after the
                 meeting.

                 A FERC spokeswoman cautioned that this did not represent an endorsement of Palin's plan, but that
                 Kelliher is pleased that there is progress being made. FERC, in a report to Congress last month,
                 expressed concern about the state's progress on the project. The report noted that over the past year the
                 schedule has slipped considerably and that prospects of an application are more remote than a year ago.

                 "The fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if Alaska gas is to
                 be part of the nation's energy supply solution anytime in the coming years," the report states.

                 Palin said she is meeting today with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to discuss the plan.

                 Bodman, in a letter to Alaska officials last year, expressed concern about the lack of progress on the
                 project. He warned that opportunity for Alaskan gas to serve U.S. markets could be "overtaken" by
                 liquefied natural gas imports if the Alaskan resources are not perceived as viable.

                Rutherford said one of the upstream incentives would be changes to state oil and gas lease provisions to
                provide what Rutherford called more predictability in how royalty rates are determined. "Right now it is
                a rather complicated formula. We are willing to change that formula to be more certain for producers
                who commit their gas into this project," she said.

                from greenwire this afternoon                                                                     Page 2 of 3


                The plan would also provide additional tax incentives for producers that commit to supplying gas during
                the first "open season," the period in which pipeline developers solicit commitments to supply gas to the
                line.

                The state would provide, for 10 years, a tax credit equal to any differences between tax rates in place
                during the first open season and any increases imposed by the Legislature, Palin said. "We want to
                ensure your profitability is insured for approximately 10 years as it relates to the state production tax,"
                she said.

                Another aspect of the proposal, Palin said, will be provisions aimed at ensuring the project can be
                expanded to allow new gas produced to be added later. She said this was needed to tap future supplies
                beyond 35 trillion cubic feet of reserves that producers currently hold.

                Palin and Rutherford also said developers will have to provide "timelines and benchmarks" for applying
                for federal approval and presenting budgets. Palin said the prior negotiations suffered from a lack of
                certainty.

                The state will include five gas off-take points to help provide for state energy needs. Palin said the plan
                would provide "a more secure United States and more robust economy for the state of Alaska and
                ultimately for the nation." The plan also addresses work force issues, such as steps to provide jobs to
                Alaskans on the massive project.

                Palin has been meeting federal officials and the state's congressional delegation to promote the
                forthcoming proposal.

                'Very interesting'

                An aide to Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said the senator is behind Palin and hopes the plan works.
                Stevens' office also provided a transcript of a brief interview Stevens gave to Alaska Public Radio
                yesterday, in which he called the idea of the state providing up to $500 million in up front funding "very
                interesting."

                Palin met Monday with FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher. "We talked about her efforts on the Alaska
                natural gas pipeline, which I believe represent the best hope for building a pipeline to bring Alaska's vast
                natural gas resources to the energy-consuming lower 48 states," he said in a prepared statement after the
                meeting.

                A FERC spokeswoman cautioned that this did not represent an endorsement of Palin's plan, but that
                Kelliher is pleased that there is progress being made. FERC, in a report to Congress last month,
                expressed concern about the state's progress on the project. The report noted that over the past year the
                schedule has slipped considerably and that prospects of an application are more remote than a year ago.

                "The fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if Alaska gas is to
                be part of the nation's energy supply solution anytime in the coming years," the report states.

                Palin said she is meeting today with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to discuss the plan.

                Bodman, in a letter to Alaska officials last year, expressed concern about the lack of progress on the
                project. He warned that opportunity for Alaskan gas to serve U.S. markets could be "overtaken" by
                liquefied natural gas imports if the Alaskan resources are not perceived as viable.
