            Governor -
                    This is exactly the kind of issue that the Health Care Strategies Council will be addressing . Every health
            and social service provider group in the state has and will be making a case to you and our legislators for why
            their rates have not been adequately raised during the past 3 -10 years. Without a thorough analysis of the cost
            and compensation for each component of the entire system of care , we will have unintended consequences for
            the state if we make changes based on isolated advice.

            Dear Governor Palin:

            Attached is a letter from three Alaskan businesses -one for profit, two not for profit community agencies-whose
            PRIMARY mission is care of Alaskans who are elderly or disabled . We urgently ask for your careful consideration
            of the budget crisis we discuss in our letter.

            Thank you.

            Thank you.
