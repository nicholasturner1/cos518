               To:       Sarah Palin
               Subject: CH 2

            Ch 2 ran with the angle of a rift between you and the delegation . Lisa got hit with a question about it specific to
            Gravina and she said that it would have been nice to have some communication from the Administration to the
            delegation and to the borough and city mayors before the funds were pulled. Your shot was of your apology for
            whatever lack of communication occurred . I think you did the right thing and it came off fine ..."We're doing our
            best, we make mistakes, we apologize,and we learn from our mistakes ..." In the end , it seemed like a non-story.

             By the way, I go to DC tomorrow for an Aerospace States Association meeting-one of those traditional LG things
             I do. I have lunch with Katz on Wednesday , and asked for meetings with Lisa and Rep. Young . I didn't call Sen.
             Stevens this time .... no real reason except I saw him the last time I was in DC and missed Young.
