          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin,




          You must let Sen McCain know that you would serve and run as his VP. Every woman in my
          family(all independents) will support a McCain/Palin ticket. For all of us who have
          children in uniform (as do you) we must have a team that will win the war and take care of
          our troops. God Bless,



          Tom Cosentino
