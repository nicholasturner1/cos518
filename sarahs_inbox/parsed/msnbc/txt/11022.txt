             MESSAGE:

             Hello,

             I have recently relocated to Idaho to open a restaurant for The Coeur d' Alene Resort.
             (Bonsai Bistro & Sushi Bar ). I have had the opportunity to work with Harbor Crown Sea
             Foods and the captains of the " Deadliest Catch ". We had them down here to do a dinnere/
             educational weekend to give the people of this area a chance to understand the fragile
             dynamics of the Alaskan crab / fish sustainability & industry . Through Keith & Florence
             Colburn and Ken Dorris from Harbor Crown Seafoods , I have heard nothing but immensely
             great things about you and your campaign in Alaska . I just wanted to take this opportunity
             to say hi & that it would be great to see stronger sound leaders running for the
             presidency such as yourself in the future . Please stop in and say hi when you are in town.



               best regards,



             Troy Chandler
