         MESSAGE:

         Im currently deployed on operation Iraq freedom in Kuwait.It really depresses me that our
         leadership in the national guard has no concern about troops well being on this
         deployment.We work at least 14 hours a day and our schedule is constantly changes,my
         commander just informed us that soliders who have not passed a pt test or height and
         weight could. not go on any MWR trips (Morale , Wellfare ,Recreation).This in my mind is
         very wrong.We come here to defend our country, leave our families and love ones, knowing
         we might not come back and a commander tells us we cant play sports or go on a trip to
         better our well being is totally wrong.I 've been in the guard 12 years and im sick of the
         leadership we have that is why i am not re-enlisting.Our leadership is more concern with
         there own selfs than the wellfare of their troops they command.
