                 Subject: Arctic Power/Funding - CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


               I understand that the House Finance Committee voted yesterday to double the
               appropriation for Arctic Power. It's not my business to intervene in State budget
               matters, but I thought that you might want to see the email below that I sent to
               Karen Rehfeld and Mike Nizich responding to an inquiry from Karen.

               this is consistent with your previous position on this subject as I recall it from prior
               emails.

               Please note that my email address has changed. My new email address is
