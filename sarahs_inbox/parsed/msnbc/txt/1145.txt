MESSAGE:

Dear Governor,



I join in rejoicing over the birth of your son. As the parent of a daughter (now 20 years of age) who
has Down syndrome, I would like to offer a suggestion. http://www.nutrivene.com/ is the website of a
wonderful pharmaceutical company that makes supplements for children with many types of special
needs. They have a physician. who specializes in genetic disorders to whom they often refer families
so that they can establish what nutritional supplements would be most helpful. Of course this isn't a
"snake oil" cure - nor is it some megavitamin formula. What their regimens do is help to correct any
inborn metabolic disorders. In the case of Down syndrome (AKA Trisomy 21), for example, the extra
chromosome produces too much of certain enzymes, which their formulae correct to some extent.
For my daughter, Daisy, it has meant improved speech and fine motor skills. Daisy will always be the
beautiful person she is with Down syndrome, but Nutrivene has given her a boost for which we are
most gr

ateful. Please ask someone to explore this (I know you are busy beyond belief) for your family.
