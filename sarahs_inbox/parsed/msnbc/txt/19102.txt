           Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
           fixes...

          I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M Hill that are currently under contract
          with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
          than 100 people.  An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
          informed.  The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
          winter work.  Sorry I don't have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand
          just a few minutes ago.
