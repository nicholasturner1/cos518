         It's not a matter of needing thicker skin tho, it's a matter of stating truth, firmly, so
        Alaskans can trust our motives and actions . All too often we hear publicly something
        that's spun political, it's our job to set it straight and then let Alaskans judge for
        themselves . It won ' t be a knee - jerk reaction when we respond appropriately and timely to
        anything we know is being used to deceive the public.



         A reporter is meeting me in a few minutes on wolf control - but he'll no doubt ask about
        ACES and politics, too.




         Hollis laid out serious allegations about dissent from within. We'll now answer it.
