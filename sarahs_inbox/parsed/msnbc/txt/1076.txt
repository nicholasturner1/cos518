I missed Wesley's but will check it out.



Don't know why we pussyfoot around these guys who are 1) asking for millions in capital projects and
2) refusing to lift burdensome fees on the backs off Alaskans, small businesses. Let alone refusing
to address the slanted playing field killing the state's smaller medical facilities.

I wonder if I ever had that lunch with the Homer bidder. Yikes- does anyone remember?

Frank- did you see wesley's blog on biz lic? Shoot. Don't know who's idea it was, but it was all about
transparency! Letting alaskans know who was sitting on important bills(s). Stedman's comment was
the email shouldn't have been sent, instead the chairman should have been requested to move it!
What a joke. How many times was he asked to move it? Well maybe the blog/story will give the issue
publicity and the follow up can open a door to also speak about tire tax and other good bills they're
still trying to kill because they're either greedy spenders and/or they hate to see our name on
anything that could pass. I wish Mike wouldn't have given a "no comment" comment in reply to
wesley's questions on this.

Hilarious!



Reminds me of the Homer Library luncheon where Lt Gov Leman's lunch barely fetched $200, and
Candidate Palin's lunch fetched $650 for the Library Foundation.



John and Nicole? Harris is married??

Clark and I were at a fundraiser tonight for Special Olympics and one of the auction items was a
package trip to Fairbanks in the old Murkowski jet for 7, a stay at Pikes and lunch w/Binkley and his
wife. It was secured by John and Nicole Harris. There was only one bidder and it was Nicole Harris. It
was valued at $4,000 and she got it for $1,500.:)
