               I agree to both pts.



               I don't think Jay could get more disrespectful to Pat than where he's going with his
               questions/comments today.

              I saw that.   I guess there is no end to his political grandstanding . Pat did a good job
              responding , don't you think?  I know that no one expected you to present the bill.

              likes of Jay.

              Pat,

              Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
              committee. hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
              guys anyway I can!
