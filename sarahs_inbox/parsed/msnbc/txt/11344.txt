             Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 22nd, 2008



             Dear All:



             The community members of Nikolski were able to recover the loader and

             lines.     They have changed the oil in the loader and need a new starter,

             before determining whether or not it will be salvageable. Magone Marine

             is assisting in locating a starter. The community will attempt to

             develop a stronger beach anchor with local supplies. The Redeemer is in

             Dutch Harbor.




             The weather outlook for this week is not promising. This weekend looks

             to be the nearest opportunity but the forecast will be updated as the

             week progresses.     APIA, APICDA, Nikolski IRA Council, and Magone Marine

             are all working closely to see that this next emergency fuel delivery

             occurs. The community has an estimated two weeks of fuel remaining.

             They are burning heating oil for electricity, a costly situation.



             A new update will follow upon new information. Please let me know if you

             need any more information.
