           Jessica - I will handle this one. This should have come directly to me as the Governor
           does have a limited amount of fishing/hunting license that she can decide who to give them
           to.  Thanks, Janice

              I called Sean today and talked to him about our process . I told him that I would periodically call him to keep him
              apprised of our progess on the heads up meetings. I gave him the big picture description of our approach we will
              take with the department meetings.

              Good morning,

              Can you s ke N . and Karen R. so I participate in
              the development of your legislative agenda and budget ? I'd like to play
              a meaningful role in these as your LG. And, I see it as necessary for a
              more seamless transition months from now with the VP potential you have.

              Sean
