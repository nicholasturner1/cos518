               He's still in the press release. I just wasn't sure if he was going to be
               an honorary member. It seemed we kept going back and forth on that one.

               Please note the changes in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Also I removed Todd as
               honorary member, but he can be added back if you guys want him there.



               Thanks,
