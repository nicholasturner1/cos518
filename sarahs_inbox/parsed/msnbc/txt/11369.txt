              Subject:                 Blog


              Pls read this morning's ADN blog re: my "refusal" to meet with Mayors and others... incl
              complaints about not responding to letters/communications.



              Please don't respond that we need to just ignore blogs and/or gripes like this. The ADN
              blog is at least a forum for Alaskans to get their message across to us.



              Obviously we need to do better - if it's true that Mayors were polled and 95 percent of
              them say we've never communicated back to them (as it sounds like AML members were asked
              yesterday at their mtg), then we have a problem. As far as I know I have met with every
              Mayor who' s asked ... this means either I'm not being told of other requests, or we're
              dropping the ball somewhere, or there' s some gross exageration on someone 's part.



              We must step up and allow as many constituents to meet as possible - even if that means my
              continued cancellation and/or rearranging internal staff issues to do so. We need
              constituents to know - esp these Mayors who are on a tear on this - that we're working
              hard for them.



              Thank you
