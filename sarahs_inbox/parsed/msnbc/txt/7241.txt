        Dear Ms. Palin: Governor Sarah Palin will be traveling to the National Governors'
        Association meeting in Michigan on July 20, and will not return to Alaska until early the
        following week.   She will therefore not be available to attend or speak at the tournament
        at Eagleglen.   Please let us know if you will hold this event again next year, perhaps we
        can accommodate your request at that time.



        Sincerely,

        Kari Spencer

        Governor's Scheduler
