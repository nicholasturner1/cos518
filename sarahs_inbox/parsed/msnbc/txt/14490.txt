           Dear Gov. Palin, .




           Congratulations on your precious baby boy! What society says is imperfect, God deems as
           perfect!  Yes, your son has something "extra", you, your husband and God on his side!



           God bless you on this incredible journey that God has called you!



           Respectfully,



           Pamela Feldhues
