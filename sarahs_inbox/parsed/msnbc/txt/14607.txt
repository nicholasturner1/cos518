             Subject: May 1 Bill Signing Info




             Governor,



             Here is all the info on tomorrow's event, as well as your remarks. Kris will hand-deliver
             your briefing packet to you tonight. The seniors are very excited to see you at the event
             - one, a retired nurse and professing Democrat, said she loved you so much, she even voted
             for youJ



             A few things to be aware of:




             * The Senior Center will be presenting you with a gift at the end of your speech, and I
             suspect it was made by seniors. So linger a little, as it may take them a little extra
             time to make it to the podium)

            * You will be leaving the event before its conclusion (it is a TWO HOUR LONG EVENT), and
            the event sponsors are aware and very much understand. They will explain at the beginning
            of the event that you, Commissioner Jackson, and Mayor Begich will all be leaving after
            your remarks are finished.

             * My suggestion is that you open the gift in front of the seniors , thank them, and then

                                                                   1




                                                                                                                PRA GSP01_0016656

             exit the room to your left, shaking seniors' hands as you pass by. You should be able to
             get in and out, especially as Mayor Begich is speaking directly after you; the seniors are
             SO excited that you're coming.




             That's all for now. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of
             further assistance.  Thanks!
