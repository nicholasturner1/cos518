                 Subject: Mayor Kiawunder / Gustavus Fuel Tank Farm

               Governor.

               LAW (Deputy AG Tillery) has reviewed the language of the judgment affecting Gustavus ' ability to build a new
               tank farm with DNR. LAW believes the judgment allows a new tank farm to be built on the site of the current one
               and to expand the area by the amount of land needed to comply with " land use, safety, or environmental statutes
               and regulations of the State of Alaska." This should allow Gustavus enough room to build its new tank farm.

               DNR has sent Mayor Kiawunder an application for a conveyance from the State to Gustavus for the land it
               needs. Commerce / AEA has been asked not to pull the grant from Gustavus and to give the community time to
               complete the conveyance process . My understanding is Commerce / AEA does not have a problem with waiting.
