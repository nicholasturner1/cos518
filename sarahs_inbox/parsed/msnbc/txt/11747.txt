             Gov Palin,



             The summer you were running, you told me on a radio station that ..."you would not go
             against an Initiative that had passed by a majority of the voters". You probable remember
             it too?



             Well the aerial wolf hunting was voted on twice and YOU know how it came out.



             Now your supporting stances that ARE going against those initiatives.



             I hope you give this some serious soul searching. If you keep this stance., IE supporting
             aerial wolf hunting, I can only conclude you lied on the radio.



             BTW, we need our legislature moved to ANC or at least off major route near ANC. What about
             across the inlet?



             Oh, why haven't you moved on my idea about building a Nuclear Power Plant across the
             inlet.




                                                                   1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0011201

             Oh, the oil companies don't care about us . We need to to take the oil and gas from
             them .. Pay them a little money and DO IT ourselves . Employ just Alaskans for almost ever.
             Even with the gov inefficiencies the state would be better off.



             Sincerely,



             Wm Harvey
