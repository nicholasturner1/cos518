               Talked to Rep Buch today. He conveyed he was upset about the BOG appointments too. I let him know that you
               received 3 names from AFN and 2 of those names were conflicted out. I went on to say you tried for several days
               to get a hold of the 3rd nominee that you were very interested in talking to, but had no luck getting a hold of him
               and had to go with someone else. He was appreciative of the response.

               Anyway, he asked that I pass on that he would like you to touch base with Mary Nelson , Reggie Joule, and
               Woodie Salmon, but specifically Mary. He thinks they would appreciate hearing this response too. I've copied
               the governor incase she runs into any of these guys in the hall in the mean time and is caught off guard.

               I thought the news coverage was good tonight. Bill did a good job conveying you and the governor don't consider
               candidates based on race, and that Sitka and Tok are rural.
