                 Subject: Invest in Alaska Housing Finance

               Dear Governor,

               Please consider making a capital investment in Alaska Housing Finance Corporation so they can expand their
               portfolio. of Alaskan mortgages. With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in financial trouble and the large private
               mortgage companies such as Countrywide and GMAC all but shut out from the capital markets , a strong and
               growing AHFC is good for Alaska.

               No home transaction should fail because reasonably priced financing was not available.
               AHFC in previous years paid dividends to the legislature , I would replace that capital at a minimum and see what
               benefits of giving them more would be.

               Gunalcheesh
