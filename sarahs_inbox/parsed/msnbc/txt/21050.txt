        Just spoke with Eric Donaldson, Crab Broker (FL) in regards to the Oct. 27-29 crab tour.
        This item was auctioned off and purchased at price tag of $15,000.00. The dinner raised
        $44,000 for children's charity.   The focus on the Oct. tour is to educate the health of
        Alaska Fisheries and what Alaska does for sustainability. There will be 50 retailers and
        Chefs including Germany.   Jonathan and Andy (which you have met) with the Time Bandit -
        Deadliest Catch will be there also. They are first class guys and Alaska should be proud.

                Governor's Briefing for Meeting with St. Paul Island Entities - October 3, 2007

                Proposed Attendees:
                Heather McCarty, Central Bering Sea Fishermen's Association (CDQ group)
                Simeon Swetzof, Mayor of St. Paul
                Pat Hardina, representing TDX, the St. Paul Native Corporation
                Mateo Paz-Soldan, an attorney working with Central Bering Sea Fishermen's
                Association and the City of St. Paul

                Topics: The representatives of St. Paul want to discuss community protection
                and custom processing regulations in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands king
                and tanner crab fisheries.

                Community Protection:
                      One aspect of the complex regulatory scheme under which crab fisheries
               are now managed is that a percentage of the crab must be delivered in a
               Northern port. This ensures that St. Paul will have a significant amount of
               crab deliveries. This regional delivery requirement is tied to the processor
               quota, not the harvesting quota. Representatives of St. Paul are concerned
               that if the percentage of processor quota is reduced, it will reduce the amount
               of crab landed in St. Paul, since fishermen will be free to deliver anywhere and
               may choose to deliver somewhere more convenient or with higher prices.
                      Crab processing is very significant to St. Paul's economy and they rely on
               that revenue to ensure that their processor remains open for other fisheries. I
               have told them that we are sympathetic to their concerns for continued viability
               of their community and are looking for ways to continue historic delivery
               patterns into St. Paul even if we determine that some reduction in the
               percentage of processor quota is the best option.

               Custom Processing:
                      St. Paul is also interested in a regulatory change to allow more
               processing to occur in their community. Currently, they are limited by the
               processing quota ownership caps. They have proposed "custom processing",
               which would allow the plant in St. Paul to process more crab as long as they do
               not own the processing quota. There are also several other communities that
               have a similar problem and are seeking a similar change . We are in the
               process of analyzing this proposal at the council. I have told St. Paul that we
               are willing to consider such a change as long as it is limited in scope so as not
               to raise concerns about excessive consolidation in the processing sector.

                         April 27, 2007

                         The Honorable Sarah Palin
                         Governor of Alaska
                         P.O. Box 110001
                         Juneau, AK 99811-0001

                         Dear Governor Palin:

                                 As representatives of Saint Paul Island's main entities, we are writing to express
                         our concern that the carefully constructed balance between processors, harvesters, and
                         communities in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) crab rationalization program,
                         which is necessary to protect the interests of all participants, may be altered in a manner
                         that is harmful to our community. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council
                         (NPFMC or Council) is in the first stage of a planned 18-month review of the program,
                         and is naming a crab advisory committee to consider, among other things, the effects of
                         the 90/10 split between "A" shares which are regionalized and must be delivered to
                         processors owning processor quota in designated regions, and "B" shares which can be
                         delivered anywhere.'

                                For various reasons, specified in greater detail below, Saint Paul's economy is
                         almost entirely dependent on crab processing. As a result, negative impacts to the
                         processing sector impact the community's economic base and other dependent
                         businesses. Although crab stocks continue to be low, the rationalization program has
                         ensured that some level of economic activity derived from this fishery has remained on
                         Saint Paul and in the northern BSAI crab region. We therefore urge that the program,
                         which is only 18 months old, be given an opportunity to work.

                             We would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to extend to you an
                     invitation to visit our historic community and the rich marine wildlife that characterizes
                     the Pribilof Islands.

                     1. The Transition from Fur Sealing to Fishing on the Pribilof Islands:

                            For over a century, Saint Paul was not allowed to develop a commercial fishing
                     industry due to the exclusive federal management of the commercial fur seal harvest.

                     I         The program summary included in the "Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab Rationalization
                               Program Report, Fishing Year 2005/06, prepared by NMFS (12/14/06) provides a valuable
                               overview of the main elements of the program on pages 1-9. The report may be accessed at:
                               http://www.fakr. noaa .gov/sustainablefisheries/crab/Tattrpt/2005crabreport.pdf.
                     2
                               The Pribilof Islands have a unique history due to the fact that until 1983 the Islands were
                               administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the exclusive purpose of harvesting fur
                               seal pelts. No other commercial (i.e. fishing) activities were allowed by federal administrators out
                               of concern that it would impact the commercial fur seal harvest. The Native Aleut residents on
                               both Saint Paul and Saint George Islands were employed in this commercial operation which was
                               inherited by the U.S. Government when it purchased the Alaska territory from the Russian Empire
                               in 1867. In fact, historians note that it was the valuable Pribilof fur seal operation that spurred




                                                                                                                                  PRA GSP01_0006204
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com                       Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




                         Then, in 1983, the U.S. Congress directed that the federal government's fur sealing
                         operations be phased out. With fisheries being the only viable alternative to fur sealing
                         on the Pribilofs, the community scrambled to develop the necessary fisheries-related
                         infrastructure in the late 80's and early 90's with the support of the U.S. Congress and the
                         State of Alaska.3 The first stage of the Saint Paul Harbor was completed on August 4,
                         1990, at a cost of $32,332,600. In addition, the community indebted itself with millions
                         of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and build facilities that would support the
                         development of a fisheries-based economy such as a fuel farm, a power plant, water
                         storage facilities, a landfill, and other utility upgrades.

                                  The 1981 collapse of the Bering Sea king crab fishery and the need by harvesters
                          and processors to diversify from king crab into opilio crab provided Saint Paul with the
                          opportunity to enter a major fishery. The Bering Sea crab fishing industry took
                          advantage of Saint Paul's harbor and the community's considerable investments in
                          fisheries-related infrastructure to initiate shore-side landings, processing, and vessel
                          support services for the fleet. Saint Paul's proximity to the opilio crab grounds with the
                         associated benefits of reduced fuel costs, time, deadloss, and safety risks, plus its fresh
                         water reserves, its airport, and other support services , were extremely valuable to a non-
                         rationalized derby-style fishery. The first significant opilio landings in the harbor
                         occurred in 1993 at the Unisea barge followed in 1995 at the Trident shore plant. The
                         processing and harvesting sectors clearly benefited from their relationship with Saint Paul
                         and the considerable public and private investment on the Island. The community and
                         the State also benefited 4 As a result, in the late 90's, Saint Paul was, after Unalaska, the
                         largest generator of fisheries business tax in the State of Alaska.

                     III. The Impacts of the Collapse of the Opilio Crab Fishery on Saint Paul:

                             In 1999, when the Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G) announced a
                     significant reduction in the Guideline Harvest Level (GHL) for opilio crab from
                     approximately 192 million lbs. in 1999 to 28 million lbs . in 2000, our community was
                     forced to take drastic actions . The City receives a portion of the State levied fisheries
                     business tax on all crab delivered and processed by the Island's shoreplants as well as by



                                U.S. interest in acquiring Alaska in the first place . Within ten years of the purchase, the fur seal
                                harvest had paid for Alaska' s entire cost to the U.S. of $ 7.5 million . The history of the American
                                operation of the fur seal franchise on the Pribilof Islands and the treatment of the Aleuts through
                                1947, is documented in Aleut Communes of Saint Paul Island v. United States. 42 (Ind. Cl.
                                Comm. 1, 149 (1978)).
                     3
                                A $20 million trust was established pursuant to the 1983 Fur Seal Act Amendments and the
                                federal government and the State of Alaska committed to helping Saint Paul and Saint George
                                build harbors necessary to develop a fisheries-based economy.
                     4

                      floating processors stationed within three nautical miles of Saint Paul Island5. In
                      addition, the City receives a 3% sales tax on crab delivered to processors inside the Saint
                      Paul Harbor as well as a sales tax on fuel and other supplies sold in the harbor. As a
                      result of the fishery collapse, the total decrease in revenues to the City of Saint Paul in
                      2004, 2005, and 2006, as compared to 1999, was 84%, 84%, and 86%, respectively. This
                      is almost directly proportional to the 85% decrease in the GHL from 1999 to 2000 and
                      subsequent years. Several major areas of City revenues such as onshore and offshore
                      processing, fuel distribution, harbor services, and local businesses continue to be
                      depressed. These effects are summarized in the chart included as Attachment A.

                              The decline in revenues experienced by the City is indicative of the declines
                      similarly experienced by privately held businesses in the community. These revenue
                      declines have been felt directly by Saint Paul's 460 residents through loss of jobs, loss of
                      consumers , loss of the community day care facilities , and curtailment in air passenger,
                      cargo and bypass services to the mainland. As of the date of this letter, the City of Saint
                      Paul officially has 38 employees, down from 50 in early 2000. The 2000 Census listed
                      the population at 532; many residents have moved off the Island due to lack of work and
                      opportunities. The departure particularly hurts the long-term viability of the Island as
                      many of those leaving are educated, skilled, and young. The community is now heading
                      into the eighth year of the opilio crab fishery collapse. However, the scenario would
                      have been much worse if Saint Paul had not been protected by the Three Pie concept built
                      into the crab rationalization program.

                      IV. "Three Pie" and the Benefits of Rationalization for Saint Paul:

                             As a result of the crisis brought on by the crab collapse our community was
                     forced to make a number of difficult decisions . One of the first steps was to request, as
                     an affected fishing community, that the Secretary of Commerce, under the authority
                     extended to him by Section 312 (a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
                     Management Act, declare that a commercial fishery failure had occurred due to a fishery
                     resource disaster. Such determination was made by the Secretary on May 11, 2000, and
                     due to the continued collapse of the opilio crab fishery has been extended by successive
                     notifications from NMFS. This declaration allowed Saint Paul to tap into federal
                     assistance and provided the impetus for proceeding with the development of a
                     rationalization program in the crab fisheries.

                            On the rationalization front, the community with the support of the State, played a
                     key role in constructing the proper balance among processors , harvesters, and
                     communities, known as "Three Pie." Critical from the community ' s perspective was that
                     the US Congress, the State of Alaska, and the NPFMC (the Council) recognized that the
                     considerable federal, state, and municipal investments made on Saint Paul that proved
                     invaluable to developing a commercially successful crab fishery in the Bering Sea,


                            The fish tax is 3% for shorebased facilities and 5% for floaters (see A.S. 43.75.015(a)). The state
                            refunds 50 % of the tax collected to cities located in unorganized boroughs and 25% to cities
                            located within organized boroughs (A.S. 43.75.130(a)).


                                                                        3




                                                                                                                                  PRA_GSP01_0006206

                      merited protection within the context of rationalization, in a manner similar to that
                      extended to the harvesting and processing sectors.

                             Congressional approval of the crab rationalization program in January of 2004 set
                     the stage for ending the derby style crab fishery and for the consolidation of harvesting
                     and processing activity in the Bering Sea. As the main port in the designated northern
                     region of the Bering Sea, Saint Paul has benefited from this program, even though crab
                     stocks remain low and the community's revenues are still at 85% of what they were in
                     1999. While at present only two of the six crab fisheries are open, required deliveries to
                     northern region processors have helped generate revenues of slightly more than $600,000
                     per year during the last seven years which have helped the City to survive until the stocks
                     return and new fisheries can be developed (see Attachment A).

                             Moreover, even at low quota levels , the limited crab processing taking place on
                     Saint Paul thanks to rationalization provides the economic basis for the local CDQ and
                     IFQ halibut fishery as the local fishermen have no alternative location to process their
                     halibut. CBSFA contracts with Trident at Saint Paul to custom process the halibut
                     delivered by the local fleet. This fishery is a major source of employment and income for
                     the community - in 2006 it generated income of over $2,400,000. This is significant for a
                     small community. Furthermore, through its CDQ allocations, CBSFA has promoted
                     economic activity by delivering its allocations of Bristol Bay Red King Crab (BBRKC)
                     and Opilio to northern region processors based at St. Paul.

                             Some 300-400 non-residents work at the shore-based Trident processing facility
                     during the crab season . In addition, transient fishermen who deliver crab are also
                     important to the local economy. These individuals are an important group of consumers
                     and source of business for the Community Store, the Tavern, the Package Store, and the
                     Hardware Store. The local village corporation, TDX, obtains substantial revenue from
                     other related services such as leasing land for freezer vans (crab ), sales of fuel , and hotel
                     services, as well as jobs. Businesses such as PenAir , Northland Services , and Delta Fuel
                     are dependent on these flows of people and trade . It is clear that without crab processing,
                     the Island would face economical collapse.

                             Finally, without crab processing the community would be unable to attract
                     investment in the infrastructure, permitting, and other upgrades necessary to diversify
                     into commercially valuable species such as pollock and cod, and survive in the long term.
                     This would be an unfortunate development given that Saint Paul 's greater proximity to
                     the commercial fisheries which are gradually moving into the northern Bering Sea, in
                     addition to high fuel costs, makes the Island an ideal location to support the North Pacific
                     industry.

                     V. Conclusion:

                           For the above reasons, the community views with concern challenges to the 90/10
                    A share/B share split . This is not only a harvester/processor issue, as this split is the basis
                    for labeling quota as either northern or southern region quota and is currently the only
                    protection that Saint Paul has. It is therefore important to maintain a proper balance




                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0006207

                         between restricted use (regionalized ) processor quota shares , which are matched on the
                         harvesting side with regionalized A-shares, and B-shares which do not need to match
                         PQS/IPQ, and are not regionalized . Preliminary Council analyses, moreover, show that
                         there are no significant B-share and C-share landings in the northern region . The level of
                         landings of B-shares and C-shares in Akutan and Dutch Harbor, in the southern region,
                         which are a full 22% higher than those ports' share of A-share landings, illustrate that the
                         northern region is almost completely dependent on the A-share component (90%) in this
                         program 6

                                 The community believes that the problems being attributed to the crab
                         rationalization program by some participants in the Council process are being solved and
                         do not require alterations to key elements of the program at this time. In the northern
                         region, these problems have been aggravated by incidents such as the ice events in the
                         harbor during the last two crab seasons and the fire on the Steller Sea processing vessel.
                         All of Saint Paul's entities, however, are working closely with the processing and
                         harvesting sectors, to solve the problems associated with the low crab quotas by allowing
                         for custom processing arrangements that would maximize operational efficiencies for
                         northern region participants. We hope to have this project up and running in time to
                         allow us to process opilio and BBRK crab as well as CDQ and IFQ halibut for the next
                         season.

                                Governor Palin, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss these issues and
                         our concerns in person with you in Juneau , Anchorage, or on Saint Paul. We would like
                         to meet with you before the next Council meeting , beginning June 4, at which the crab
                         program review will be discussed and potentially acted upon.

                            We are aware of your personal commitment to healthy and viable rural Alaskan
                     communities and we hope that you understand our perspective regarding this matter.
                     Again, we would be delighted if you decide to accept our invitation to visit our unique
                     community . We look forward to your response.
