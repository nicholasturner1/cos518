           Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES . Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
          Majority going to ask for a similar briefing . If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
          deafening , Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.




            Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
          "details" of ACES before going all in.
