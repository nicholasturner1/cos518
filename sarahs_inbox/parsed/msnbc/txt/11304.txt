            Governor - I have the briefing paper from Anna Kim on the RCA. It is a meet/greet "Thank
            you for your work."




            Summary:  The RCA's purpose is protecting consumer interests and promoting economic
            development.




            The Alaska Legislature created the RCA in 1999, giving it broad authority to regulate 198
            utilities and 21 pipeline carriers throughout the State.




           The RCA regulates public utilities by certifying qualified providers of public utility and
           pipeline services ; and ensuring that they provide safe and adequate services and
           facilities at just and reasonable rates , terms , and conditions
