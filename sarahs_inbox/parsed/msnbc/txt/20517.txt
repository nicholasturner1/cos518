                  Subject: Independent Cost Estimate for Juneau Access

                Leo:

                We have received correspondence from several legislators requesting an independent review of the cost
                estimates for Juneau Access . I see no reason why we would oppose this other than the cost of the review, which
                I believe would be between $50-250k. While this is a significant amount, it does not seem unreasonable in view
                of the significant cost of the project and what several legislators have said is a significantly underestimated cost
                now and a significant risk of cost overruns on construction.

                If there is additional geo-tech work that needs to be done so that a meaningful estimate can be provided , please
                let me know your thoughts on getting that geo-tech work completed so we have reasonably accurate estimates to
                consider along with other factors in making decisions.

                Thanks,

                Randy
