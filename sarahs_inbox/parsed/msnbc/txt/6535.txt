         MESSAGE:

         I am the wife of deployed Alaska Army National Guard Soldier, Kenton Ward, and the
         president of the Juneau Family Readiness Group. Recently you visited the soldiers in
         Kuwait and I am inquiring if you would like to sponser an activitiy for the families in
         Juneau waiting for their loved ones to return home. Maybe a visit to the Governor's
         Mansion, cookie baking with you at the Mansion to send to the troops, or simply
         participating in one of our monthly meetings or home coming planning sessions.



         I look forward to hearing from you and appreciate your support.
