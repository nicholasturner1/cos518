            MESSAGE:

            Dear Gov. Palin,

            What a beautiful baby you have! You and your husband must be so proud! The days of hiding
            Down Syndrome children are disappearing. Thank goodness! You two were picked to raise Trig
            to be the best he can be!



            Many years ago (1985) I trained 'disabled'young people to work at McDonalds.(McJobs) This
            training was to give them a step up in the real world of employment. I was fortunate to
            have 2 young folks with Down Syndrome. They were so happy to be working with 'normal'
            people. I learned they can do so much more than they are given credit for. Expect great
            things and they won't disappoint!



            They seemed to take what fellow employees told them to do as gospel! That turned out to be
            my best tool for training!

            One went on to work at the Tinker Air Force Base . One kept going to school.



            God Bless you and your family!

             (Marilyn) Jo Rahn
