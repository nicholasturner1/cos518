           Subject:                 Travel tonight instead


           Fyi Janice- I won't be ready this morning for clothes to be picked up to check early
           luggage, so I'm going to assume that I can get out tonight instead. And worst-case
           scenerio (but it wouldn't be so bad... there's a lot of work I can get down here today) is
           I'd try to get out tomorrow if tonight's flight is full.

              I'll let Bob know via this email.
