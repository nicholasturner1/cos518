               First, please thank Gov. Patin for visiting Mississippi and showing her concern with the hurricane this week.
               We really appreciate it more than she could possibly know.

               Secondly, please pass along to Gov. Palin that she gave an outstanding speech tonight. I watched it on
               FoxNews then flipped to a couple of networks and I believe the correct word would be "stunned".

               Congratulations to someone who has inspired a lot of people tonight and probably single handedly brought a lot
               of pride to many Americans. Thanks Gov. Patin.
