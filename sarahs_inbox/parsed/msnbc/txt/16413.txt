            Governor, I understand your concerns. If it will help, Rep Edgmon requested this bill
            signing in his district and I am sure he would put it in writing if that would help.



            Just a thought; otherwise I will let him know it won't work this year.



            Kelly

            Kel- Talked to Todd about the trip to Dlg for Bryce's bill signing- he agrees that the
            perception would be that this is way too self-serving and "coincidental" that it would
            happen to fall during the peak of the comm fish season- so please scratch that idea of
            traveling to Dlg for it. If Bryce is around Anchorage would he just want it signed
            locally?
