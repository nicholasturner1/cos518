           Subject: Congressman Boehner's Alaska Trip



           I have made contact with the office of. the House Minority Leader. The bottom line is that
           the Governor is invited to have dinner with Mr. Boehner and his entourage Saturday (July
           19th) or Sunday in Fairbanks.



           The staff recommends Saturday, because the House members will not be as tired, and the
           Governor could also offer some welcoming remarks. Sunday is less preferable for several
           reasons.



           I also asked whether the Governor could actually accompany the entourage to the North
           Slope.  The staff is checking with Mr. Boehner and will get back to me as soon as they
           can.



           Please advise whether either July 19th or 20th is a possibility. I will let you know as
           soon as I hear about the North Slope portion of the trip.



           P.S.

           I understand that the Governor will meet with the Republican Challengers group on July
           17th.  So, there should be no conflict with Mr. Boehner's trip.

                   Malcolm and Wally,

                   I gave no permission to use my name in your new BB 111 ad. And I was never asked or contacted to use it

                   As you well know, I am a solid advocate of the passage of AGIA!

                   I sent you another note just yesterday reaffirming that position!

                   You can attempt to speak for 138,000 voters if you wish, but not for me.

                   AGIA did not even exist in 2002.

                   Now I see you have already sent this ad with my name in it to all the 60 Legislators.

                   I demand that you send out to all of them IMMEDIATELY a retraction of my name in that ad with a true
                   explanation of my position stating you NEVER contacted me in any manner to use my name. And that I am
                   on the record many, many times as supporting AGIA's passage!

                   I will take all available immediate legal actions if you do not Today.

                   I am astonished that you and this new "splinter group" of BB It, forming something new called BackBone III
                   would use my name in such a manner when you and all members of BackBone tI know I do not support a NO
                   vote on the AGIA legislation! I do not see Mayor Jim Whitakers's name in the YES column. And he has
                   been in favor of AGIA for sometime now.

                   Fix this immediately. You all are and have already caused me great harm no doubt.

                   Sincerely,

                   Scott R. Heyworth.

                   p.s. Lord help if this AD is ever published with my name in it whatsoever. I am not nor have ever been any
                   party to BB Ill.
