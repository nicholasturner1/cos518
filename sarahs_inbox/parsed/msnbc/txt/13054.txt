             Governor:

             I spoke to the staffer carrying the bill for Rep. Lynn. They are trying to come up with amendments that will eliminate or
             greatly reduce the fiscal impact on the Permanent Fund. The staffer said there may be another hearing but was sure the
             bill was not going to pass this session. I offered to work with their office over the interim.

             The bill has been heard once this session in House State Affairs. Mike Bums of the Permanent Fund
             testified against the bill ("we do not believe that investment decisions made for social or political
             reasons are in the best interest of the permanent fund.") The permanent fund also produced a fiscal
             note estimating costs at nearly $11 million for FY 2009, and about $8 million a year for every year
             thereafter. The permanent fund attributes most of these costs to fund managers raising their rates for
             having to change how they handle their portfolios.
