              Legislature wraps up this week- these remarks state the leggies will wrap up Energy Plan end of
              next week. Is that incorrect?

              Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event info. I'm still waiting on feedback for the remarks from several in your
              Juneau office, so there may be changes yet, as Janice may have mentioned. I've told them I need to get
              the remarks to you as early this evening as possible. I've reworked the remarks, integrating several
              comments from Rhonda McBride. I will have Tara print your speech off on cards for you tomorrow
              morning, as I have jury duty first thing. Yay for civic responsibility© Anyway, I'll get updated remarks to
              you ASAP, and please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any
              further assistance.

              Thank you!

              P.S. Senator Inouye' s (HI) last name is pronounced °ih-no-way."
