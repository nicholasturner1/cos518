             MESSAGE:




             Dear Governor Palin,




             Just to let you know I thought you did a creditable

             job on C-Span the other day. I thought you answered

             most questions in a knowledgeable way.



             Right now I'm at our "winter quarters" in Arizona,

             but Marilyn and I plan to return to Alaska in April.

             While here I joined the Minuteman organization and I must

             say I was impressed the way the outfit handles itself.

             Immigration is my big worry as far as the US is concerned.



             Advice: Stay away from the VP slot, tempting as the idea may be. Run another term as
             governor and, you will be ready for a national slot as you will be known for your honesty
             and forthrightous manner. Yes, it's the simple things that count.

                                                                    1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0012690
