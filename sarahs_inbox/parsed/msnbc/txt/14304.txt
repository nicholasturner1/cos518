                Subject: a poem
                Mother nature played a trick
                Look outside and you'll feel sick

                The snow has been coming down all day
                Who'd believe it's almost May

                Another fourteen inches more
                Flakes coming down by the score

                Every time I look outside
                I want to run, I want to hide

                Disbelief makes me look again
                If you could read my mind, you'd know I'd sinned

                I wondered how it was affecting my sis
                Then I looked in the email and knew she was miffed

                We both took some pics to have some proof
                This is an April snowstorm, it is no spoof

               So don't look for us until late May
               We're not coming out no matter what they say

               I will take a blanket and a book
               Go and find a cozy nook

               But please don't talk to me just now
               I might explode and have a cow

               I will be thinking of you, Lorri
               Knowing that you feel like me
