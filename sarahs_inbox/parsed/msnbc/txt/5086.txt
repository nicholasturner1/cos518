                Meghan,
                I believe it is a bit premature to hold interviews at this point. However, if you'd like I could
                speak with Joe Carroll and simply explain that we are in the process of developing a law of
                general application, with a brief description of the principles involved.
                ^ s your call, just let me know your preference. By the way, my cell phone number is Privili
                It i
                Privilege
                Happy New Years,
                Marty

                         Please read note below. Are we prepared to hold interviews yet? Shall I pass along
                         to Commissioner Rutherford or simply say that we're not ready to disclose any
                         details in the gas pipeline plan at this point in time.
