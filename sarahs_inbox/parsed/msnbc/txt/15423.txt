                       Dear staff member: please deliver this , as the Governor was not aware of it when I spoke
              to her last night, and seemed Interested.


              Dear Governor Palin,

              It was very nice talking to you briefly last night at Sean 's campaign reception . My daughters really got a
              kick out of seeing your autograph on the back of Sean's yard sign; they still don't believe it is real.

              I had mentioned the Corsair Unit Appeal that is currently being reviewed by Commissioner Irwin. In our
              conversation, I expressed that Pacific Energy would not be bringing the jack-up drilling rig to the Cook
              Inlet waters if their unit expansion is not approved . I would like to explain that that was neither a threat
              nor a bribe to get the approval . If it came across as such during the brevity of our discussion , it was not
              intended that way. The simple fact is that Pacific Energy (Vladimir Katic) has spent a half a billion dollars
              acquiring the assets and leases of Forest Oil and in the. acquisition and interpretation of additional G&G
              data. It was through that recent interpretation that he decided the Corsair structure was economic to
              explore and produce with a jack-up drilling rig.

                                                                                                                        Page 2 of 2



              Approximately 2/3rds of the Corsair structure is within that expansion acreage . Without that acreage , the entire
              prospect becomes uneconomical . It is going to cost Pacific Energy over 20 million dollars to get the jack-up rig to
              the Cook Inlet- before drilling even the first well. Each well is going to cost approximately 20 million dollars
              more. As you can imagine , the company must be fairly certain of the reservoir size and potential to justify that
              kind of up-front expenditure . This is real money that is going to be spent in the State , and real jobs.

              As you know, the Cook Inlet has not had a jack-up rig in its waters for almost two decades ; this is a very real fact.
              Cook Inlet reserves are in a steady decline and exploration is stagnant . The opportunity to have a jack-rig and
              revitalize the Cook Inlet is upon the State , and it will benefit all of the south central and rail-belt. energy
              consumers , and of, the State of Alaska itself. If you have just a few minutes , please look into the Corsair decision
              and appeal . I had worked for the Division of Oil and Gas for over a decade and this has to be the worst decision
              coming out of the Division that I have ever seen , not to mention one of possibly the most crucial to future Cook
              Inlet exploration and production . Should you wish to discuss this with Vladimir Katic of Pacific Energy , or myself,
              our contact information is as follows:

              I fully understand your busy schedule as Governor, with the gas pipeline , Exxon litigation , clean water initiative,
              whales, polar bears, new baby, being a mother and a wife . My family and I personally appreciate everything that
              you do for all Alaskans , and am constantly amazed at how much that is. You are indeed a valuable natural
              resource to the State yourself.

              If this message reaches you, thank you for your time and interest.

              Sincerely,
