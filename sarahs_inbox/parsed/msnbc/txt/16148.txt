                Subject: June 24 appt

              Janice:
              I spoke with Governor Palm earlier today and she is interested in having a
              demonstration of a software program that we can set up either in her 17th floor
              conference room or my 19th floor conference room on Wednesday June 24. An
              alternative could be right after the Cabinet meeting on June 25, but the Governor
              indicated she might be headed to JNU.

              Please let me know what time works so that I can have our conference room reserved
              or you can reserve the 17th floor. Attending would be:
              Governor Palm, potentially Mike Nizich , Annette Kreitzer , Anand Dubey, Director of
              ETS, and Darrell Davis, State Security Officer.

              Thanks.
