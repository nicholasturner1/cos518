             Had a good mtg with Leo- he'll be there tomorrow for budget savings plan

             to answer any questions that may pertain to transportation's $billion

             account. We agreed on his deputy commissioners- Richards (already there

             in Juneau) for roads, C Klein (from Ketchikan) for aviation.
