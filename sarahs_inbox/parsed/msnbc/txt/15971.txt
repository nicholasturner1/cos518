          Yikes- I think erika misinterpretted my comment in answer to the suggestion someone made
          that it was too short notice to get a caterer for tonight - I said we could do costco or
          whatever and do it ourselves if need be- (if it was too late) it was that important that
          we utilize our time here together to get people on friendly ground. She thot I said I
          didn't want us to get a caterer. Sorry
