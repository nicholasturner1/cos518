                Subject : Request for flags to be flown at half staff,
                Dear Governor Palin,

                As a retired military member and the immediate supervisor of those men who gave their lives in support of
                the Statewide Alaska Land Mobile Radio (ALMR) project I am asking that you as our governor consider
                flying the Flag of our country and our home state at half-staff one day as a tribute to these men and their
                families. I also would ask for your support in permitting the construction of a flag pole out in front of our
                facility in memory of these men who were dedicated to the mission of the ALMR project.

                Your consideration is greatly appreciated in this matter.

                Respectfuly,


                Allen Kirby
