            PUBLIC INVITED TO DISCUSS OIL TAXES ,    SPECIAL SESSION

          Democrats to host community event Saturday




          ANCHORAGE - Oil revenue , good food and community involvement will all be on the menu
         Saturday when several Democratic legislators host a public discussion about oil taxes and
         the upcoming special session . The group of seven legislators invites the public to
         participate in the event at the East High multipurpose room from 1-3 p.m . Saturday.



          The legislators will bring people up to date on the governor ' s oil tax bill , Democratic
         priorities and goals for the special session and other significant news related to the
         October special session . The public is encouraged to share views , concerns and ask
         questions about oil taxes and the future of economic stability in Alaska.




          The legislators in attendance called for this year ' s special session in April, as the
         recent federal indictments implicating last year ' s oil tax legislation , were issued.
          Governor Palin soon after agreed . It is important for the public to understand the issues
         we'll need to discuss in order to craft a fair oil tax that achieves a fair share for
         Alaskans , and a fair investment atmosphere.



          There will be plenty of good food available ,         and the atmosphere will be conducive to
         positive , energetic discussion.
