               Governor,

               Here are your remarks and event info for tomorrow 's event Please note that the LG will be just landing when the
               event begins, and so will likely miss the opportunity to speak in the opening ceremonies . Sen. Ted Stevens will
               be present, and Congressman Young is unconfirmed at this time. I will ask Susie to keep an eye out for any
               legislators or dignitaries and provide you with a list to add to your remarks . Susie will also have an extra copy of
               your remarks, just in case.

               Just as an FYI, if Piper is with you for this event, there are tons of kid 's games and contests to participate in.
               Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns and have a beautiful weekend!
