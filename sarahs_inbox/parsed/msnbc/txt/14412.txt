            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,

            Congratulations on the birth of your new baby! I am a mother of two boys in Arizona, and
            my younger son (Luke, age 3) has Down syndrome. He is a joy, and I know that he is
            fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139). Your little Trig is as well! We know how
            overwhelming this can be, so we just wanted you to know that you and your family are in
            our prayers (especially if Trig has any immediate health issues).

            Thank you for choosing to carry your baby to term in a world where a disturbing 9 out of
            10 women would not have made that choice.

            God bless you and your family!

            Robyn Williams
