                 Frank: this is evil, isn't it? Walt lied that you pressured him. This is
                 sick and out of control. He lied about Annette and Todd also-

                  Here's the statement I sent. Sharon sent to Ross and Baldino. I've
                  talked to her 4 times and they won ' t accept a new statement , saying 10pm is
                  already set and only a continuation of the 6pm .... saying the story is set.

                  Hi Sharon,
                  Can you blind copy me in when you send this?
                  --------------------
                  I absolutely cannot remember a single instance where I contacted Walt Monegan
                  over Trooper Wooten.  The report I saw tonight claiming otherwise is false.
                  I've only had a handful of conversations with the Former Commissioner, and
                  discussing Wooten has never been part of those conversations.
