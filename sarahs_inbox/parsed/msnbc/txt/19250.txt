            Talis- pls have one of your folks draft a short letter to Exxon

            "encouraging" them to pay the $500mil. (See today's ADN story today) we

            need to be on the record as telling them to pay up, end this thing, end

            this misery. Then we're doing a presser on it (in fact let's do the

            presser stating I've asked DOL to write this letter).
