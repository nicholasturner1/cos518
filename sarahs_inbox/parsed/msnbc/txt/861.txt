Todd,

Would you want me to send this flyer out to the Commissioners in an email format? Just a thought.

Hi, Todd-



I'm happy to help with the fundraiser . Do you have a list of people who have already said they are
coming , so I don 't ask someone twice? Do your friends here have lists that they 're calling? To help,
i'll need all the info - start time, the food , etc. - how big 's the TV? So if there's someone here who's
coordinating for you - just let me know and I'll get all that info from them.

My home number is Redc+ct^el    or you can call my cell   P-eedae6ed

Ken K.
