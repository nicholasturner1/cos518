            Donuts tomorrow morning in the AGIA war room. 14th floor @ DNR.




            You're invited. I'll bring the donuts, I'll meet you on our floor at 9am, then we'll walk
            down with the grub to thank the team at 9:15.



            Tara- can we get a couple pots of coffee to bring down too? Thanks:
