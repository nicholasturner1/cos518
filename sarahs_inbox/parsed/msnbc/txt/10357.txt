               I won't be near a pc to make any more edits on my speech after circulating it last
               night... I'm booked from my commute in, to this morning's speech, to filming a PSA... so
               someone else will have to figure out how to make adds edits before the press event - thank
               you.

              Mike,

               Sorry I missed your call today. I just picked up messages tonight and left you a message
              on your cell. I think the governor's draft remarks are generally pretty good but I have a
              few suggested changes:
