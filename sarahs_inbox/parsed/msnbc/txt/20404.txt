               The media coverage you have been getting is completely out of line. We believe in you and what you are doing.
               As govenor of alaska you have done an outstanding job. Do not let people like Haicro an Fagen drag you down
               as they have tried to ever since you were elected , and before. There are a few law enforcement people that
               should be put in the same boat and sent out to sea to be sunk This is rediculas for these people to treat such an
               honorable govenor like they do . I just want you to know my wife and I are behind you all the way ... Dale Hilimer &
