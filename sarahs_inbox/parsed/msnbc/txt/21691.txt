                 In follow-up to the scheduling request I spoke with David Gottstein this morning. As you know he is very
                 supportive of your efforts on ACES. It doesn't sound as though a meeting is necessary with either him or
                 Governor Hickel. David is flying to Juneau later this week to meet w/legislators and also said that his Dad and
                 Larry are taking out ads - I believe they'll begin running tomorrow - in support.

                At some point, perhaps in December, he'd like to meet with us to further discuss an Israel trip.
