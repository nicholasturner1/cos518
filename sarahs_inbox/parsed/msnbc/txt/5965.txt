          I am at home - with all three numbers available - give them any of them:

          3733113

          Privileged o
          And my state cell phone number too.



          I'll have to head into Anchorage soon - hopefully they will call soon.

          They'll call you!       What number should they dial?

          KAri/Cayce: The number is not reaching Tony! I'm trying on my land line and both cell
          phones - try something else, either another number or have him call me asap!

          I can not believe they do things like this - I will try, but it's quite frustrating to
          have to readjust tight schedules - even a half hour throws things out of whack.
