MESSAGE:

Congratulations on your new son! I am sure he will be a very special, loved and adored little boy. I
envy your decision to take on his special needs when in this society people are so willing to give up
life so easy. I have been blessed with 3 healthy children of my own and I would hope that we would
have as much courage as you and your family. Take care, I will not wish you good luck, because I
believe you and your family are going to do a great job with Trig.



The Skipper's.
