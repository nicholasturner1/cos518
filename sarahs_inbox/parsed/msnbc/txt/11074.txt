              This was in today's ADN letters.




              Fagan is sounding more and more like a nagging wife

             All right Dan Fagan -- enough! Everyone knows how you feel about Gov. Sarah Palin. You
             have made that clear. It is also getting to be really boring for us ("What if the oil
             industry isn't lying?" Dec. 30).

              I used to love listening to Fagan -- so entertaining and he really used to leave me with
                                                                    1

              points to ponder.

              Frankly, he is sounding more and more like a nagging wife and you know what is said about
              nagging wives: Better to be alone in a barren desert than to be harassed with a nagging
              wife. So, I'm out.

              No more Fagan for me until his attitude improves and he gives us what we came to love
              about him in the first place.

              One last question for Fagan . Where was your big flippin' floppin' flappin' mouth when
              Frank Murkowski was in there screwing over every Alaskan, including you?
