             Pls have this publicized so we're not behind on the messaging, and so Lyda, et al don't
             bother "telling us" to do it... that will be the result if they and Alaskans don't know
             that we're already doing it.



             Beth/sharon- pls do presser on this. Thanks

             Dear Governor Palin et al,

                         We are going to be signing the Texas Amicus Brief in support of

             the 2nd Amendment. It is scheduled to be circulated for sign ons on

             Feb. 4.     We cannot sign on before it is ready. There is no amicus to

             sign on to today. We are not preparing a separate amicus. The brief we

             will sign on to will be due on Feb. 11. Talis

             Did our amicus brief supporting gun rights on DC ever get filed? Leggies

             are passing resolution directing us to do so... didn't we already do

             this when we first got word of the opportunity months ago?

             Senator John McCain on ANWR:



             Here's the exchange as recorded by National Review ' s Jim Geraghty:



             Mike Goldfarb : " Some people are perplexed by your rhetoric on global warming .              Is this one
             of those no surrender ' issues , or is there room for discussion?"



             McCain : " As far as ANWR is concerned , I don ' t want to drill in the Grand Canyon, and I
             don't want to drill in the Everglades . This is one of the most pristine and beautiful
             parts of the world."
