        I was trying to gauge when Steve O'Brien (Channel 11) left. Seemed to be

        between 12:30 / 35 and 12:50pm (when we left). He was there a bit, but was

        definitely gone by the time we got out of there.

        Then that employee was not truthful in stating VT was in the parking lot.

        Saw the reporter, chose to not enter facility? Unless the reporter was

        hanging around a long time...
