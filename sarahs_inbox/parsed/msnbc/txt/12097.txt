               Governor -

              We had a call today from Sandra Petterson with Bill Allen (City Manager-Palmer). Sandra stated that she was to
              ask for Ivy Frye as Ivy would guarantee this meeting request! Of course the front desk was amazed by this
              statement.

              Bill Allen will be in JNU tomorrow, Wed., 02.13 and Thursday, 02.14.08. Mr. Allen is requesting to meet with the
              Governor in regards to: Performing Arts Center, Transcanada Base of Operations, and Mat-Maid Property. I
              informed Sandra that the Governor's schedule was fully booked for Wednesday and offered that Mr. Allen meet
              with your staff assistant(s). I was told that Mr. Allen wants the Governor only and that is the request put forth.
