            Bruce/Kurt:

            Please - Bob Lester at KWHL will forever be in your debt (so will I) if you'll join him on
            the air tomorrow morning - Wednesday, February 13. He and his listeners really want/need a
            bit more AGIA perspective that only you can provide. His # is 632-1987, or pls call the
            station 349-9691.   They're big supporters of AGIA.



            Thank you guys so much. You're doing amazing work. I love to feel this evolution in the
            puiblic towards more understanding of our position - it's thanks to your outreach and
            education efforts that do work.
