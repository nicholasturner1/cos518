                  Dear Governor Palin and Family,

                 The family of Ice Alaska would like to invite the entire Palin family to take part in the
                 awards ceremony of Ice Alaska . This year's theme is "The Greatest Show In Ice" and
                 it would be the ICEing on the cake to have the children as part of the big show!

                 The ceremony begins at 8:00pm at the Ice Park, and it would be an honor to have the
                 Palin children participate in the handing out of the golden chisels to the winning artists'.

                 We look forward to seeing you all at the Ice Park on Saturday, March 10!

                 Sincerely,


                 Dick Brickley
