         Sheesh, you couldn't make it simple , could you. ;-)



         I spoke French and other Dems yesterday . They seem ready to rumble over gross. I think
        they could easily sink the whole overhaul in an effort to get their way.

           We may have a quick and dirty sectional today. . .but there really isn't anything I would
          consider "new".



           There are pages and pages of conforming references throughout the DNR and DOR titles to
          enable information - sharing between the two.



           The repeal and reenact provisions deal mostly with cook inlet provisions. The reason for
          those provisions is that a potential loophole was plugged in the erg-writing process. . .but
          with rather weak statutory authority.



           The effective dates are somewhat complicated.  A couple of provisions are retroactive to
          April 1, 2006. Most other things are effective Jan 1, 2008.



           There is a somewhat new wrinkle on the definition of lease expenditures...rather than use
          regs to determine what is out, we will be asking for the aigthority to promulgate regs
          spelling out what is deductible.

           Good morning. I've got the bill, but is there a one-page cheat sheet of what's new? Is
          there anything in here that we didn't write about in early September? Any idea what time
          Commissioner Galvin is going to hold his press conference? The press release just gave a
          date and a call-in number, but no specific time.



               Sincerely,



                                                            2
