          Got it. I appreciate this info, as I have to be honest with you in my need for an
          education on this topic. I've been absent from this international debate - so feel free to
          pile on any addl info you deem appropriate for me to absorb on this.

         There have been no Senate votes in recent history .                So, it's hard to tell exactly who
         supports the Convention and who does not.



         Previously, Senators Lott (MS) and Inhofe (OK) have confirmed their opposition. On the
         other hand, Senators Biden and Lugar, Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the
         Senate Foreign Relations Committee, support the Convention, but it is not yet clear
         whether they will bring it up this year.



         According to Senator Murkowski' s staff , the Senator is getting Alaska constituent mail on
         both sides of ratification.  A majority supports approval.



         I think we can expect some opposition in             Alaska if you support the Convention. There are
         some Alaskans who believe that the US has            failed to assert its sovereign rights to Wrangel
         Island and certain other islands owned by            Russia . These individuals can be expected to
         oppose ratification of the Convention for            fear of losing US sovereignty.




                                                                                                              P RA_GS P01 _0004227

           I know from precious experience that these folks can be quite vigorous in their
           opposition.  However, most experts believe that, in the absence of US approval of the
           Convention, we would have to assert our rights unilaterally.   For these reasons, they
           favor the Convention, because it creates a forum for adjudicating claims in a quasi
           judicial manner.

          After we finalize, Sharon can send this letter to the international reporter who asked
          about this issue on Sunday.

         This is through Mike Tibbles




         Per your request, I have drafted the letter below to Senators Stevens = and Murkowski for
                                                        2

          your consideration.




          Dear Senator -------




          It is my understanding that the US Senate may consider the United = Nations Convention on
          the Law of the Sea in the fall.




          With this in mind, I am writing to express my strong support for = Senate ratification of
          the Convention.  In my opinion, the Convention = would be beneficial to the US and Alaska
          in various ways, but I want to = focus on one aspect in this correspondence.



          As you know, several Arctic nations have recently asserted claims to = submerged lands off
          their coasts.   The Convention on the Law of the = Sea establishes the framework for these
          assertions.   To date, 155 = nations, including Canada and Russia, have approved the
          Convention.   = If the US does not ratify the Convention, the opportunity to pursue our =
          own claims to offshore areas in the Arctic Ocean might well be = lost.




          As a consequence, our rightful claims to hydrocarbons, = minerals, and other natural
          resources could be ignored. In this = regard, geologists have prognosticated that
          billions of barrels of crude = oil and vast quantities of natural gas - not to mention
          various hard = rock minerals - might be present in the Arctic. in the absence of =
          affirmative action by the Senate, these resources could become the = property of nations
          with less valid claims.




          It is my understanding that the Bush administration and many = Senators, both Republicans
          and Democrats, have expressed support for = Senate ratification of the Convention.
          However, as you know, = ratification has been thwarted by a small group of Senators who
          are = concerned about the perceived loss of US sovereignty.



         I believe th at quite the contrary is the case . If the US does = not ratify the
         Convention, we will be denied access to the forum establishe= d by the international
         community to adjudicate claims to submerged lands = in the Arctic.



         I also urge that the Congress authorize the programs and funds = necessary for the US to
         assert its sovereign rights.  The assertion = of such rights requires significant research
         and information gathering.&nbs= p; Other Arctic nations have recently begun this process,
         and I understand = that the US is moving in this direction as well.



         I believe that you have previously supported Senate ratification of = the Convention.
         With this letter, I want to put my Administration on = record in support of the Convention
         as the predicate for asserting = sovereign rights that will be of benefit to Alaska and
         the nation.  = Hopefully, this letter will assist you in articulating Alaska's = position
         to your c olleagues in the Senate.



                                                        3
