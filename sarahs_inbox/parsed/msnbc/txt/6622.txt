        Dear Mr. and Ms. Moore:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.




        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        My wife Conchita and I would assure you of our support in trying to control the grouth in
        state spending. We think all

        Alaskans need to realize how good we have it with no state income or sales tax and only
        the control of spending will keep

        it that way. Thank you for your responsible action in time it

        will pay dividends for us all.



        Yours truly,



        Allyn & Conchita Moore
