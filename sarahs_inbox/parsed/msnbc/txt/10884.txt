             Passengers die in Kodiak plane crash

            A Servant Air flight carrying 10 people crashed about 100 yards from the Kodiak airport
            just before 2 p.m. today, according to Alaska State Troopers and the U.S. Coast
            Guard."There are four people in stable condition, the other six conditions, I am unaware
            of," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane.



             In a voice mail, Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said little was known about the crash
             Saturday afternoon, but that some passengers had been killed.



            According to the Coast Guard, a Trident Seafoods floatplane recovered four of the
            passengers , while a Coast Guard helicopter recovered another.



            Those passengers were taken to Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center.



             "The remaining five are trapped in the fuselage. And as we're speaking, the Alaska state
             toopers and the Kodiak police just recovered the remaining five people on board," Lane
                                                                1

             said just before 5 p.m.



            "Originally the plane was submerged , and now that the tide has receded , rescue crews were
            able to recover the bodies ," he said a moment later.



            The plane , a Piper Navajo Chief tan , was headed to Homer, he said.

             Governor,



             Walt just left me a message that a 9 seat plane went into the water on its trip from
             Kodiak to Homer.  The plane was close to Homer which should make search and rescue
             operations a little easier.  No word yet on status of the nine individuals in the water
             but I will pass along updates as Walt sends them.



             Mike
