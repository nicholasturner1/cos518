               Governor.

               A draft response to the Juneau Delegation 's letters (May 5 , May 20) on the energy situation in Juneau is
               attached. If the preference is to not respond , please disregard the draft . If the choice is to respond , please send
               edits to me. As enclosures I have the RCA letter orders and the Empire article citing June 8th as the estimated
               date for restoring hydro power.

              Thanks

               Randy
