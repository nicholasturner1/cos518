            Governor,



            Regarding the Wynona concert, this from Tennys:. a small group of 50 will meet at the
            Susitna Club on Elmendorf and will go to the concert by special escorted buses. Upon
            arrival, there will be a small reception for everyone (a meet and greet for you and small
            group w/Wynona) and the viewing will be from a cat walk type of area on the 2nd floor of
            the hangar which will be a great view of the concert. There will be limited seating up
            there but people can take turns sitting and standing.



            I will talk to Bob on alternate transportation should you not want to ride the bus.
             Tennys needs to know how many will be in attendance with you as there is limited space
            and they need to allocate. She has invited me (and Clark) so we are going but that is
            separate from your count.



           She also asked if you'd be willing to say a few words to welcome Wynona before concert
           begins. We will nail down the specifics and timing.



           Kris
