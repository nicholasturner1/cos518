                           Governor Sarah Palm
                           State of Alaska
                           P.O. Box 110001
                           Juneau AK 99811-0001

                           Dear Governor Palin:

                         The Community of Port Alsworth is thanking you and the legislature for the proposed
                         appropriation in the FY 2009 Capital Budget of $150,000. This money is a very small part of 1
                         budget, but it will mean big changes to the people in our remote Community on the shores of
                         Lake Clark.

                         In 1996 the Community recognized the need for basic fire and life saving equipment. At that
                         time, the first steps were made toward the construction of a fire hall. Twelve years later, the
                         skeleton of the building exists. We have land, a well, electricity and a basic structure. Not onl:
                         has the building grown, but so has the vision. The building currently functions as a place to ho
                         fire equipment, but it whispers of so much more potential. It could be a place to teach rescue
                         skills and CPR. It could be a Community meeting place. In an emergency, it could be an
                         emergency shelter and a command center. If only it were completed.

                         The State funds will allow Port Alsworth Improvement Corporation to complete the interior. I
                         plan to add lighting, plumbing, insulation, and more. This project has always been at the top o
                         our priorities list, and we have worked on it as the funds became available. So far, $145,000 It
                         been spent plus hours volunteered by Community members to build the shell of the building.

                         Our Community has worked for this reality. The appropriation in this year's budget will provi
                         our Community with more than a fire hall. It will provide safety in an emergency, security in t
                         disaster, and Community in times of turbulence. We again thank you for your attention to our
                         Community and to our requests.

                         Sincerely,



               10/22/2009
