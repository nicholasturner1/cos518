               March 19, 2008
               State of Alaska
               Office of the Governor
               Juneau, Alaska

               Re: Lower Kasilof Boat Launch, FY2009 Governors Capital Budget Appropriation Department of Fish and
               Game, proposal #44823 in SB256

               Honorable Governor Palin:

               I understand that Fish and Game proposal #44823 is in your capital budget, but I would like to request
               that you veto this funding. How can F&G get funding to buy private property , to put in a public access
               motorized boat launch , before there has been any environmental assessments , public concerns, and
               input from the local residents , on how this will impact the river and our community . We do not want any
               motorized public access this far up the river, if there is a need for a motorized boat launch then it should
               be centrally located at the mouth of the Kasilof River where all the other boat traffic is located. We are
               concerned that once F&G get funding for this proposal we will have no recourse to keep this out of our
               neighborhood and protect the Kasilof River.

              I am aware that Fish and Game say they are going to evaluate two sites for this proposal , the Trujillo
              parcel and Foxhill Estate Subdivision . I cannot support the funding of this proposal because the Trujillo
              parcel is where Kenai River Sportfishing Assoc. targeted , while floating with Fish and Game, as their ideal
              boat launch , that will be-used primarily for commercial guide drift boat interest , but in order to obtain the
              use of Federal money from the tackle tax , they need to create a motorized boat launch for public use. I
              am concerned that what is happening to the Kenai River with overuse of motorized boats and increased
              traffic, how can we let the same devastation happen to the Kasilof River ? As residents of this community,
              do we not have the right to express our concerns and have them heard before F&G have the funds to
              purchase one of these sites?

               There are many people, myself included, that are very concerned with the issue of more traffic on the
              Kasilof River, especially with motorized public access , when the Kenai River is being purged of two-stroke
              motors, where will all those displaced dipnetters and fisherman end up? This is bigger than F&G wanting
              to use access through our neighborhood , this is going to be devastating to the Kasilof River and our
              community.
              Last year you vetoed this project. Unfortunately , it has passed the House and Senate process this year, I
              urge you to veto it again.

              Thank you for your time.

              Sincerely,

              Cynthia Smith
