            MESSAGE:

            Dear Govenor- I heard about the possibilty of candidate for the presidency John McCain
            asking you to join him as his running mate on radio AM (aka: talk show host: Rush L.).
            Sparking my interest, having not really knowledge of your governorship, I visted the state
            of Alaska website and read your biography and all that you have and are doing for your
            state, and I think you are what this country needs! Please consider vice-presidency if
            John McCain asks you to be his running mate! I know that you would have to uproot your
            family from your beloved state of Alaska but you would be a breath of fresh air for the
            rest of our great country! Having a nature such as yours,the values of which I think you
            represent, I believe no one could put a special interest and deter you from making the
            right decisions. This is just one email and I hope not the last that you will hear from
            others regarding this purpose.- Sincerely, John A. Jackson/ Firefighter City of Mobile,
            Alabama
