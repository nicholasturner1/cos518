              Thanks John - Your Op Ed was published in the Juneau Empire today. The Ketchikan Daily News
              ran it this weekend.

              I reside in DC. Thanks for shopping this . If someone doesn't publish it, you and I
              might want to talk about other ways to respond to Congressman Young 's inaccurate
              and gratuitous shots at the Palin administration.

              P.S.
              I don't know the Juneau Empire staff very well anymore. Please make them
              understand that I came from Alaska. I don't think of us as DC lobbyists.

              Please note that my email address has changed . My new email address is jwkat @alaskadc.or-.
              Thank you.

                 The Juneau Empire is considering your Op Ed piece . They would like to know what city you
                 reside in. Thanks
