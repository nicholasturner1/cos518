             So who gave Ramras the free lunches? From one year to the next he's sure changed his tune
             on ppt and potentially getting gamed by industry...



             Remember his testimony/questioning last year?

            Jay was opposed to ppt before and threatening to closely monitor oil industry shenanigans
            - wonder what happened the past few months to twist all that around.

            Oh man. Very good. Is there anything others can look at on the record to prove his
            hypocracy?

             Off the record...

             One of our friendly reporters has been listening to the house floor sessions on ppt during
             the murk administration where ramras was opposed to the ppt they were voting on and
             disgusted by the oil lobbyists he saw marching up to the gov's office. And he vowed that
             if he was tricked by the industry and their lobbyists when it came to this important tax
             policy then he would come back to jnu angry and pounding on the table demanding answers.
             Now today he says he doesn't know why he's here and doesn't think there is anything wrong
             w ppt! What a flippin flip-flopper! What happened to the accountability in what you say
             and do?!? If this doesn't come out in a story (which I think it will) than I'm making sure
             it comes out in a letter to the editor.

             Can Jay be any more of a disrespectful yahoo in his questioning of Pat today?

            You're handling it very graciously-if I was pat I would have jumped over the table and
            strangled him. Who does jay think he is?!? He needs to shut his mouth, set his ego aside,
            and try and learn something. And another thing, if he's so upset about being in jnu during
            his "offseason" he shouldn't be a legislator!

            Pat,

            Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
            restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
            committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
            guys anyway I can!
