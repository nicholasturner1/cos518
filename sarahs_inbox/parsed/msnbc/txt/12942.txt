           It's very important that Alaskans aren't led to believe we're dismissing the idea of an
           Alaskan project. Delicate in the way it's presented, but Alaskans need assurance we're
           comparing the Canadian and Alaskan projects.

          Wesley's ADN this morning is enlightening, if TC is truly lobbying Congress with the idea
          that the bridge shipper idea is more than a suggested "creative idea", but rather a
          prerequisite.



          It's important for Alaskans to know we're not dismissing an Alaskan project while the
          gasline team considers the TC application. I don't want to loose Alaskans' faith in our
          process here - the process that includes comparing an in-state project most understood
          (and ultimately, I believe, most supported) by the public. I believe we need to make more
          efforts in assuring Alaskans that we're not stubbornly eliminating any other gasline
          option besides TC... that we're doing all we can to get OUR gas to OUR markets, including
          seriously considering the smaller AK project.
