         Dirk called. He'll fax Katz his speech so we can use any of it in our presser. His folks
         will touch base with Katz on NPR-A issue also so we're tracking together on 10-yr
         moratorium idea.



         I told him we ' re disappointed but can speak positively about his efforts and his
         acknowledgement that oil/ gas isn't to blame for threatened listing.



         Hans and Kevin Meyer were part of conversation also.
