           Subjects      Response to Kristy Tibbles



           In your letter addressed to me concerning sheep hunting in Units 13D and 14A. The reason
           you gave for turning those units into drawings, was to put forth the effort of maintaining
           a trophy population, preserving genetics and that the overall sheep population in this
           area is not in jeopardy.



           You informed me, that since the sheep population in this area is not in jeopardy. The
           changes made by the Board of Game where made to maintain a trophy population, thus
           preserving a high quality sheep hunt and that the Board of Game, did not have to follow
           the sustained yield principals in Alaska Statute 16.05.256 which states: Whenever it is
           necessary to restrict the taking of big game so that the opportunity for state residents
           to take big game can be reasonably satisfied In accordance with sustained yield
           principles, The Board of Game will limit the taking of big game by nonresidents and
           nonresident aliens to accomplish that purpose.


                                                                 1

           I would like to know where you received your information from??? I was present at the
           Spring 2007 meeting of The Alaska Board of Game. The only proposal from the Alaska
           Department of Fish and Game was proposal 158 5 AAC 85.055 (a) Hunting seasons and bag
           limits for Dall Sheep. Create a new Dall Sheep drawing hunt area within Units 13D and 14A,
           Chugach Mountains.   Pages 149, 150 and 151 of the spring 2007 Alaska Board of Game
           Meeting.  That proposal clearly stated, that the reason behind that proposal was the 35
           percent reduction in total number of rams observed during survey flights. That proposal
           also states that the level of contribution of horn size attributes passed on by ewes, as
           far as Dall Sheep are concerned, HAS YET TO BE DOCUMENTED!!!!    Under that proposal The
           Board of Game should follow the sustained yield principal and restrict nonresidents only.
           Especially when they have the highest success rate and are the primary reason for the
           number of rams being harvested.



           I would like to know if it common practice for The Board of Game or The Department of Fish
           and Game to routinely pass new regulations based on totally different information provided
           by there own biologists within The Department of Fish and Game?



           Sincerely
