                Governor,

                I have been going over my to do list and I wanted to give you a quick update of the items we are working on as
                newstpublic announcements from now until the end of the year. I am scheduled to fly up to Anchorage Monday
                night and stay until Wednesday night . This will give me an opportunity to spend some time focusing on the
                budget and energy . I am going to work on the energy administrative order today and I am hopeful while in
                Anchorage, we can meet with Emil to talk about AIDEA (emergency board meeting ) and also meet with Emil and
                Irwin regarding the AO and other energy components.

                Anyway, if there is something that stands out as being absent , please let me know.

                Mat-Maid - Hopefully we will have good news regarding purchase proposals.
                Legislation - We can announce any of our legislation (once completed) for next session. I will keep working with
                Russ on potential bills.

               Let me know if you would like me to forward this to the Lt. Governor. Since he is out talking to so many groups, it
               might be helpful.

               Mike
