            Governor -



            I just received a call from Marvin Odum, President, Shell Oil's Office. Mr. Odum would
            like a call with you today (10-15 min. call) in regards to giving you an update on the
            Alaska Drilling Program.




            Mr. Odum is in DC today and available from 12:30 - 2:45 p.m. (AK Time) for a phone call.
            I explained that you are in travel status today and that I would try to get a message to
            you in this regards.



            Contact:     Marvin Odum
