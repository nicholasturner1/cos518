              MESSAGE:

              I wish there were more people like you winning Republican (and Democrat) primaries! I'm a
              Democrat myself but would love to see more moderation (and especially less
              money/corruption) in politics and you seem to be a shining example of the direction
              politics should take. Good luck!!
