            Governor,

            How well do you know Harry McDonald , president of Carlile Enterprises or Liane Pelletier of
            ACS? I was wondering if you would be interested in calling these two Individuals and just
            touch base with them and answer questions to diffuse anything they might be hearing from
            producers . I ran into Harry at your Inaugural Ball in Anchorage . I know him personally and
            think he would be a good one with whom to speak . Liane Pelletier at ACS would absolutely
            welcome a call from you . I would guess that she would ask questions and her focus would
            be on corporate shareholders and the State "interfering " with private sector companies and
            their shareholders . But as a woman and as a President , Liane would want to hear from you
            - and I think your time would go far. I 've picked these two for you in particular because
            they were both at a press conference that I organized last fall in opposition to proposition 2
            and would most likely participate in another.

            Thanks,
            Meg
