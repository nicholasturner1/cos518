         Subject: Judicial Appointment



         Governor:



         I understand you will be interviewing John Darnall for a potential judicial

         appointment to the District Court in Anchorage. Please accept this e-mail as

         my endorsement of his qualifications. I have known John for over ten years

         through both the Alaska Air National Guard and his work in the Anchorage

         Municipal Prosecutors Office, Criminal Division.



         John has been an Alaska resident since 1981. He received his law degree from

         the University of Tulsa (same school I graduated from). He is currently an

         Alaska state employee, serving as an Assistant District Attorney, State of

         Alaska, Office of the District Attorney, Anchorage, Supervisor of Misdemeanor

         & Juvenile Crimes Unit.



         I believe John would be a terrific judge and great appointment for your

         administration.       He shares your values and vision.




         Best Regards



                                                                  1
