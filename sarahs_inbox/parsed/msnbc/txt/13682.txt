            Governor,



            I'll get with the other Sub-cabinet members and take another hard look at the [Privileged orP
           PdvileaeqqrPerspn^that made it into the 09 budget. We have a Sub-cabinet meeting schedule
            this Friday afternoon.

           Subject: More Budget Analysis




           We are continuing to refine the analysis of the budgets - attached is a two - page workbook
           - the first tab is basically what I sent this morning with minor tweaks in the FY08
           Governor Column and the second tab is a comparison of the FY08 starting point to the FY09
           Governor ' s Amended budget and the FY08 starting point to the FY09 Legislature ' s budget - I
           was trying to get to Rep . Chenault ' s statement about a 23% increase . You can get there if
           you back the supplemental amount out of our December starting point.



          However, we did not include tax credits in our spending numbers - so , you will see on the
          bottom of page 2 , a GF comparison without tax credits .  We had a 4% overall GF increase in
          December and ended up with a 7 . 2% increase - largely due to the adjustments for the
          bargaining unit agreements , and a couple of large capital requests , $ 12.5 million for
          erosion and $ 8 million for the bullet line.



           I hope this is helpful! KJR
