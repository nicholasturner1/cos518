               Dear Governor,
               Just checking in to see how are you doing , how is the newly born doing and to let you know I am
               plowing along with the promo . The stuff I got with you is great, quality, really looking good. thank you
               again for your time and patience . My problem actually is how in the world can I create a short promo
               with so much meaningful material. good problems to have, I guess...
               I will keep you informed as I move along. and...we had our own little addition : happy to let you know.
               that a new "Frank" baby-boy joined us Saturday , 3.5 Kg (7.12 Lb.), 20 inches, looks beautiful, like his
               mom, who is recovering from the C -section in the hospital. She is fine, just exhausted and enduring
               pain from the 'cutting'. The very proud father is also fine, no real pain...

               lots of good health and wishes to you, Todd and all the off springs...

               All the best,
               Elan

               PS got it all on tape, I mean ALL...
