          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,




          While I'm not an Alaska resident, I do follow nationwide politics. As a fellow
          conservative, I'm quite impressed with all that you've done for the great state of Alaska.
          Within the last year or so, you've been getting enough national attention to turn the
          heads of even those on the east coast where I am. My question for you is this: What is
          your stance on The FairTax Act (H.R.25, S.1025)? If you're not familiar with it, I would
          ask that you visit their website at http://www.fairtax.org. I look forward to hearing from
          you on this matter. Thank you for your time.




          Sincerely,




                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0019260
