              "I believe it's inappropriate to stuff a supplemental budget with a package of last year's
              vetoed capital projects, especially when the adminstration has not even seen the growing
              list of legislator's projects they've apparently now added to the supplemental budget.
              Supplemental budgets traditionally, and appropriately, fund end-of-year shortfalls due to
              unexpected costs, usually in operations of public services provided by government. The
              capital budget should be developed in a comprehensive manner."

              Rep. Meyer told Bill McAllister that the budget has / will be moved out with the capital
              projects IN.  BM wants comment from the administration.  Please advise.
