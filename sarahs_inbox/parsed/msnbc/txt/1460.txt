This blows me away. We can see about use of the one we're flying on today. Also when looking
yesterday Pen Air has regular flights out there. This is a first family event with the signing of the head
start bill, and other pending invitations.

We're working on a bill signing for late next week in Dillingham for the family. Representative
Edgemon would like to sign his Head Start bill in Dillingham and he'll be there Thursday, July 3rd.



We could fly you and the girls out mid afternoon on Weds. Janice pulled flight options and I'll bring
those with me so we can review tomorrow and discuss return if this is of interest.
