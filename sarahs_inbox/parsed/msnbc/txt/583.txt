Hello Todd,



Please let me know if you'd like for me to respond to this email on your behalf, otherwise I'll assume
you have taken care of her questions.



Just as an FYI- we do schedule tours during the summer months either at about 10 : 00am. or
2:30pm . but we take contact information (name & phone) in the event a tour needs to be canceled
due to unexpected events or maintenance issues . With the construction , we haven't scheduled as
many tours , but we do try to accommodate as many as possible.



Thanks,

Erika

Dear Mr. Palin,



I know there has been an effort underway for the past few years to raise money for the renovation of
the governor's house in Juneau. Now that you and your family are back in Wasilla, how about
opening up the governor's house (the downstairs) to tours during the summer in return for donations
to renovate the building? I'm sure there would be lots of people interested in seeing the house (even
Alaskans!).

You might raise a lot of money and be able to maintain the building without the use of state funds.



I hope you will consider this suggestion.



Thanks,



Judy Erickson
