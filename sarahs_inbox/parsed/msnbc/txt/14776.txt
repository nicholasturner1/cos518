            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your baby boy, he is beautiful!! I was just reading the
            story on the internet. You and your husband are wonderful people, I, also am very much
            Pro Life and I have a special needs Son-he has Epilepsy and Asperger's Syndrome. I also
            have two other children. I believe God makes each and every one of us special in our own
            way and he gives us as parents the task of raising our children, gifts from him. God
            bless you and enjoy every moment with your children. I'm always inspired when I read
            these kind of stories.
