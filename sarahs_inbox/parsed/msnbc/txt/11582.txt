             I'll get these to you and I'll see if we can tell who forwarded to Maher. This incident
             exposed the fact that we don't retain content long enough to easily get these kinds of
             answers . The new ETS Director and I discussed how to resolve this and he will be getting
             back to me after he talks with the Microsoft Exchange staff in ANC.

             Annette- I didn't grab the backup documents from you re: the recepient list of the email
             that got leaked. Pls leave those with me - and please follow up on who sent the email to
             Maher. He wasn't on Sunny's distribution list, correct?
