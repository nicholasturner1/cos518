          Yes - I have let Marty know that it will be over here in the office. The girls just
          headed to the Totem Pole Raising and then to the house to get changes for Trig. Janice

           Governor - I just received an email from Marty Rutherford asking if she could meet with
           you today for 30 minutes regarding AGIA messaging during the Special Session. This
           meeting would be between Marty, Kurt Gibson and Meg Stapleton(on phone). Marty is not
           presenting so would be available to your schedule.  Janice
