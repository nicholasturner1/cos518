 Todd,

 Ken returned my phone call and might give you a call. He'd like to make calls
 from the APOC website to invite lobbyists.  He also has a few people that he
 will contact to sale tickets to. Ginger sold 3 today and I'll find out from
 Chuck Collins to see how he' s done.

 When you're in Juneau Linda Perez would like to meet with you for 15 minutes.
 Is there a good time for you on Sunday (or Mon. if you're in Juneau)?

 Thank you for all of your work to raise money for the House!!!
 Erika

 Hi, Todd-

 I'm happy to help with the fundraiser. Do you have a list of people who have
 already said they are coming, so I don't ask someone twice? Do your friends
 here have lists that they're calling? To help, i'll need all the info - start
 time, the food, etc. - how big's the TV? So if there's someone here who's
 coordinating for you - just let me know and I'll get all that info from them.
 My home number is     444( or you can call my cell  OjA r-.6ed
 Ken K.
