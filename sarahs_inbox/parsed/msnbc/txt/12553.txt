            Governor:




            Commissioner Von Scheben is pressing a bit to move ahead and go out to bid on the road
            improvements and dust control work for the project in Eagle . The funding numbers he gave
            me for the project are: $1,182,000 Denali Commission and $117,000 DOT.   He also says that
            based on the petitions signed by City council members, etc., there is more support in the
            community to move ahead with the project than against it, although some members of the
            minority opposed to the project are very vocal and get some media attention.



            Thanks,



            Randy
