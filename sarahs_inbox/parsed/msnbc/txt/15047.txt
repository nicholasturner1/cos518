            What did you find out re:·who on your team leaked an email that I sent to you regarding
            our concerns on Juneau Rd? I still have not seen that email chain, so pls forward that to
            me... and I understand that a reply you sent referred to not being made aware of the
            serious concerns the Gov's Office has had on-this project for all these months? We've
            talked about the litigation, the Corps not granting the permit, the lack of updated cost
            estimation, etc... In your conversations also with Mike Tibbles over the past year did he
            communicate those serious concerns also with you?
