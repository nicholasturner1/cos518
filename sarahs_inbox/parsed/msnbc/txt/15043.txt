              Dear Govn..Palin

                    Congradulations for you and your family . I hope everything goes well for you . I
            have been doing some research

            on home heating and found a wood-pellet stove/boiler to be one of the most efficient so
            far . The problem is we (alaskans) don't have or can't get pellets.I think it should be
            given some consideration as an energy source . It seems that you can heat your house-
            shop+hotwater cheeper than with what we have now . I just think we should be able to get
            the resources we need to help off set high prices and the envirment .

                                                  Thank You
