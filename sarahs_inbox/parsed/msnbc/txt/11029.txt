              May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to
              address it before I leave for Juneau. Update on clean water initiatives/Gillam's efforts
              too?

              I agree.  We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I think
              it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change. Tom

              I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in the
              room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
              streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
              understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again , or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again , it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
