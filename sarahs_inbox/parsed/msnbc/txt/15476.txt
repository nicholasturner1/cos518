          Good point . I expect we will hear more about that. Hopefully the initial flap will die
          down after a couple of days. Karen

            For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
           capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes.  What the public doesn't see or
           understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operating
          budget. IPeced or Personal Material Redacted
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




            The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the-
           process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
           her budget.



            Just my observations.
