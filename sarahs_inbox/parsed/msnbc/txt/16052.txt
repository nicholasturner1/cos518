           MESSAGE:

           Get some national exposure. You are to good to stay in Alaska, we need you running the
           country.  You are one of the few women I've seen that I would vote for. There are not
           many men that I would vote for either. I wish you were the Republican pick this time.
           The Republicans finally have their own liberal/socialist running for President. It's
           going to be hard to vote for McCain, that is, unless you are his running mate. Looking
           forward to seeing you on the National scene.
