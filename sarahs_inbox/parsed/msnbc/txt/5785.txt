            Andy wrote to the general governor account and his message was forwarded to me.

            Governor Palin,

            I would like to thank you for the interested expressed by your office concerning my
            possible availability to serve on the Alaska Board of Fisheries.    As I
            mentioned to Ivy
            over the phone, this is not a good time for me to take up such a demanding
            position, but I was honored to be conisdered as a possible candidate, and a year or
            two in the future may be willing to put my hat in the ring for consideration.

            Thank You for your consideration,

           Andy Couch
