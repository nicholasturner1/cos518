          Right on!!! What an awesome victory... I believe it's given to us today to bolster us
          through coming days that may get tiresome as we progress further with the gasline. But the
          Irwin Line will happen!

          Governor,  I praise the Lord for you. You / your team are part of an amazing plan that we
          can't even imagine. Thanks so much for supporting us.



          This is a verse that I received shortly after I agreed to work for you. I have saved it
         ,for this day. :)



           Psalm 28:7 (NIV)

           The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. My heart
          leaps for joy and I will give thanks to Him in song.
