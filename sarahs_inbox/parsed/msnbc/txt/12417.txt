             Dear Governor Sarah Palin,

             I was watching your segment on CSPAN about how Alaska seems to have a positive effect on
             ecomny and Polar Bears being considered on Endangered Species List. I just thought I let
             you know that I heard you said, "11,000 thousand gallons of oil spill" in Prince William
             Sound. Its actually close to 11 million gallons of oil.

             thanks,

             Ceasar Montez
