           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:




           I would like to thank you for your wonderful and appropriate stewardship of the Great
           State of Alaska. One of my best friends is a transplanted Alaskan, and speaks very highly
           of you.



           It is rare indeed that someone of your caliber actually successfully gets elected. I only
           hope and pray that, someday, we have someone of your stature here in Oregon.



           God bless, and good luck!



           Sincerely,



           Les W. Turner


                                                                1
