               This is what I sent to Lisa Demer, ADN. She asked two questions and I thought I'd just send
               this written response... Sean

               Lisa,
               Thanks for calling . I'll send a quick note in response to your questions.

               My input on the big event-I ' m extremely happy for Governor Palin, Todd , and the whole
               family. I had a chance today to briefly celebrate Trig's precious life by holding him-he's a
               beautiful baby boy and he' s got two very joyful parents and lots of people who want to hold
               him. It brought back memories of holding our (Sandy & me) children when they were
               newborns-happy thoughts indeed!

               As to me taking on the Governor' s responsibilities-I was asked to and did substitute for the
               governor yesterday (Sunday) in Juneau at an event-it was the "Annual Governor's Prayer
               Lunch " in Juneau . At this point I don't believe I have any other requests to substitute for the
               governor due to Trig 's birth.

               All the best,

               Sean Parnell
               Lieutenant Governor
