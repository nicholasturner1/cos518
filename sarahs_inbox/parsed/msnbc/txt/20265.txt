          Are you on duty today? Todd's coming up w me for the Nenana Bridge ceremony. We arrive at
          noon. Can he meet you for coffee as I meet with others at noon before I leave for Nenana
          at 1:45.

            You guys could meet in the Fairbanks office if it's convenient for you. Joe Balash may
          be there too.
