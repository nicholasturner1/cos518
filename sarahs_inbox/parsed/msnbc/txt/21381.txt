             You're handling it very graciously-if I was pat I would have jumped over the table and
             strangled him. Who does jay think he is?!? He needs to shut his mouth, set his ego aside,
             and try and learn something. And another thing, if he' s so upset about being in jnu during
             his "offseason" he shouldn't be a legislator!

             likes of Jay.

              Pat,

              Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
              committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
              guys anyway I can!
