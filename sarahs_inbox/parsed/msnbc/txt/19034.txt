           The language below was sent to Halcro in response to his question about state action.

           The Department of Law requested access to the evidence gathered by the Federal Bureau of
           Investigation.  That access was denied.  We do not wish to hamper their investigations or
           prosecutions.  In the meantime, we continue to monitor the evidence presented in the
           trials. Nevertheless, we do not comment on investigations.



           In this case, the public does have the plea agreements and testimonials from Rick Smith
           and Bill Allen. They have admitted to taking illegal actions to corrupt the outcome of
           the legislative process.  Additional evidence is referenced in those documents as well as
           the indictments of the 3 former legislators.
