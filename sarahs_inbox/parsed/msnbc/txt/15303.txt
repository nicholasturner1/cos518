            These ideas all sound great! I look forward to word on how some of them can be firmed up
            and come to fruition. Thanks for working on this, and great recognition of the top title
            holders being Native - let's do something with that.

            Frank Bailey and I have been watching the rising star of Nicole Colbert, ever since she
            captured the Miss WEIO title - and have talked about tapping her talent. Frank has wanted
            to put Nicole in an appropriate spot on a board or commission.



            Recently she won the national Miss World Indian title.

            Nicole now has many financial obligations she is shouldering on her own to represent our
            great state.



            She needs some help. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

           Also, earlier this year, when we were discussing a response to the Fox Radio Racism
            Controversy,  Tara Jollie had suggested Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           - an idea that seemed to resonate with you.

           I see some opportunities coming.

           Also of note...



           At this time, just about every major title holder is Alaska Native. Courtney Carroll the
           current reigning Miss Alaska, is a former Miss WEIO .   I believe Miss Teen Alaska is
           Native as well. I'll check into this.



           Earlier we had talked about the Nenana Bridge celebration honoring Shirley Demientieff.
           Melissa Stepovich says the bridge dedication and picnic will take place on August 8th,
           unfortunately past the signing date for SB 158.       Mindy Rowland suggested a "quiet
           signing"... with a follow-up celebration on August 8th.

          Privileged or Personal Material R Nicole is well known for her enthusiastic speeches.             She
