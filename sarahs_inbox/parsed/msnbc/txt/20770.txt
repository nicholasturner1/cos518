           Juneau, AK 99811-0001




          Dear Governor Palin:




          My 10 yr old daughter has Down syndrome so I feel connected to you in a

          special way. I'd like of pass on this that no one told me until too late.

          You can massage your son's upper palate while it is still not fused so it

          will be larger and easier to control tongue thrust. And please tell people




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01 0023836

           to refer to our children as children with Down syndrome not Down syndrome

           children.



           Sincerely,




           Sandra Brewer

              Stat Alert -September 4, 2008:
              Sallie Mae - NCES - Role of
              community colleges in educating
              the population
             The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has devoted its supplement to its annual Condition
             of Education report to the role community colleges play in educating the population. Among the
             findings highlighted in Community Colleges: A Special Supplement to The Condition of Education
             2008 (htt^J/nees.ed. ov rograms/coe/2008/analysis/)) are that community colleges conferred about 70
             percent of all associate's degrees in 2005-06, 43 percent of which were in liberal arts and sciences; that
             about 30 percent of recent high school graduates first enrolled in a community college; and that about
             half of the students who began at community colleges in 2003-04 were still enrolled in postsecondary
             education by 2006, with an additional six percent having left postsecondary education with a degree or
             certificate.
