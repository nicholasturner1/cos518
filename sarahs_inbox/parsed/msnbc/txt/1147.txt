MESSAGE:

Mrs. Palin and family:



We learned of the birth of your son Trig Paxson Van Palin in the Seattle Times today. We want to let
you know we are praying for you and your family.



When I read that you knew through early testing that Trig would face special challenges, I was
prompted to pray.



Our son Gabriel just celebrated his 18th birthday on April 13th. He was also born with special
challenges. He is missing the radius and ulna bones in both arms and his legs are each bent with
the bones fused at the knee. He has been the delight of our life.

                                                   1                              ROSTON 02075

We want to encourage you to let us know if your family needs anything. We recently established a
non-profit organization called Gabriel's Foundation of HOPE. We created this organization so we
could encourage families dealing with disabilities to overcome the obstacles they face. If you need
anything let us know.



Our website is currently under construction but when you get a chance check out GabesHope.org



May the God of Peace fill you with all HOPE as you trust in Him. Romans 15:13



Bless your heart today

Steve, Gigi, Zane and Gabe Murfitt

Woodinville, Washington
