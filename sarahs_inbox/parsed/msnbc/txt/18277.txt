         Dear Mr. McMorrow:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending , live within our means , and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

         Dear Governor Palin:



         Thank you for your action concerning the budget cuts. Those cuts were needed in order to
         control a Senate and House that had gotten way out of control. You have kept your word
         and I am proud to have voted for you. Please continue to do the right things as you have
         so far.



         Thank you,



         Robert McMorrow
