              My suggestion is you offer to go on SNL and play Tina Fey, and you interview her as she plays you.

                      Thank you for the kind words for PFD. BTW, I've sent PFD employees a thank you for
                      their extra efforts this year, and passed along your recognition of their good work, as well.
                      As an aside, I met with Bowles last week. Nothing new... We're working through ACES reg
                      issues, and making good progress. We're finding that many of the oil company complaints
                      about ACES are based on a myth that were going to interpret the statute in a way to screw
                      them. We're slowly earning their trust.

                      You keep making us proud to be Alaskans.

                          Governor,

                          It's great to hear from you ! There are very few anti's griping within Alaska, but the national
                          media is getting their first taste of AGIA and they WANT it to be wrong somehow. First, the
                          New York Times wrote that the gasline is no sure thing, quoting Bert and Lyda as recent
                          converts against it ("We're shocked that TC demands $500 million from the state!"), acting as if
                          you had said the gas was practically flowing right now . Recently, we hear that a Newsweek
                          reporter wants to "blow the lid" off the real story that everybody knows we'll never get through
                          Canada, and AGIA was all a ruse to get you to the White House.

                          We'll continue to spread the truth , and explain the ongoing battle with the Producers.

                          We know you're letting people around the country know about what Alaska has to offer. Thank
                          You.

                          Hello gasline team- checking in- hoping all is well with all of you . I bear some of the anti's are
                          griping about TC-Alaska again , let me know if I need to answer any of their gripes . You're
                          doing great and people around the country are very excited about AK resource development.

                          I hear that Exxon is attending the Monegan hearing(s)? That's odd.
                           Again, hoping all is well and let me know what you need . Thank you folks!
