             Boy, that would be great and would be huge. I was just telling my Dad how I paid $4.29/gal
             for diesel - $56 total. Ouch.

              MESSAGE:

              Dear Governor Palin,

              First I wish to send my heartfelt congratulations on the birth of Trig.

              Your positive attitude touches anyone who loves the Lord and understands

              that He is in control of our lives. God bless you and your family.



              Another issue on my mind is a more down-to-earth issue. With the

              soaring gas prices, what are the chances of the legislature meeting

              under special session and exempting Alaskans from the state gas tax for

              the summer?     Alaska is especially blessed with high revenue from oil.

              Why not get a little relief from the price at the pump? Please do what

              you can.    Thanks,    David W. O'Dell

                   Hi Mr. Kelsey,
                  That was not where we left it to my recollection. I will not argue with you. Please clarify my
                  understanding of the State's position then. Correct me If I am wrong, please; you are saying then, if a
                  person has no finances with which to pursue a legal defense and representation (for having a claim of
                  permanent disability) and consequently a recourse when unethically treated and denied, that it is of no
                  matter to the State? As long as it happens without being found out and/or known, the State is not
                  interested? Did you, sir, sign any paperwork what-so-ever regarding ethical behavior or has it been
                  done away with in favor of the more profitable "within the law"? Or respecified, perhaps to mean only
                  when dealing with specific issues? I'm curious. I live daily with a horrible disease, medications either
                  don't work or work only briefly. Nothing has changed in all the years with the exception that I get worse,
                  never better. I had disability insurance, which by way replaced Social Security earnings. By my last
                  calculations the State has unethically and unfairly denied me what was mine to have in the
                  neighborhood of over 200k.
                  I am requesting an audience with Gov. Palin. Please set it up for me. Thank you.

                    Hi Dawn:

                    It is my understanding, as I indicated in an earlier e-mail, that you have exhausted your
                    appeals through the process outlined by the state. You are still free to pursue a remedy, but it
                    needs to be through civil court channels.

                    Dear Mr. Kelsey,
                    When last we communicated, you were to forward the specifics of my "case" to someone (unspecified by you
                    to me). I am checking on the progress of the complaint of which we spoke. I hope Ms. Palin is still of the mind
                    to bring a sense of security and honesty to government. The place to start is truly on those who have been
                    damaged by this unacceptable behavior, don't you think?
