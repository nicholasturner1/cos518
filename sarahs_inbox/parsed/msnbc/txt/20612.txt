               Thank you Kate- great remarks, as always. I'll stand by to hear when and where I'm signing anything... I
               don't see anything on the schedule reflecting any events tomorrow or Tuesday.

               Governor,

               Here are your remarks for tomorrow's bill signings and proclamation of September as Energy Efficiency Month.
               Certain details are still being determined by the Press and Leg Office, and so the event information portion will
               be provided to you tomorrow morning. Please let me know if you have any questions.

               Thank you!

               Kate Morgan
