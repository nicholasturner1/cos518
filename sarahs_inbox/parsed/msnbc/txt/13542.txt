                Kevin Meyer and I went to talk to Bert and Lyman. Kevin has a nice sheet that shows big increases in Bert and
                Lyman's districts with the bond bill. A result that just adds more to already heavily funded districts. Bert and
                Lyman did not take the House's concern too seriously. It sounds as if Harris will send a stronger message here
                on their next break. He wants the Senate to reduce the amount.

                Lyman tells me that he has spent a lot of time today working Hollis regarding the predator control bill. The bush
                caucus told him that it was a priority and he still is unwilling to schedule the bill. I asked him what would happen if
                an amendment was offered to another bill .and he said that it would fail - they can not pull a bill from committee.

                We'll keep working these issues.
