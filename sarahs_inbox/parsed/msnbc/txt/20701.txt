              Tom (from Wal-Mart Wasilla Stationary Dept) and I would both like to say "Congratulations on becoming the Vice
              Presidential choice of John McCain . Also Congratulations on you and Todd's 20th Anniversary. Tom and I had our
              20th Anniversary on January 29.

              The company that I work for has had a coin designed and minted for the Alaska 50th Statehood, would it be
              appropriate for Tom to give you one of the coins? I thought that maybe you would enjoy having one but I don't
              want you to get in trouble If we give you one. Let me know and then we will have to find out a place where we
              can give it to you or how we can send it to you.

              Again congratulations!! Best of Luck in the campaign.
