                Subject : Speaking points for Wednesday's bill signings
                Governor Palin,

                Here are speaking points and basic event information on tomorrow's four bill signings, along with a map
                of the second floor of the Sheraton Hotel - the signing will take place in the Kuskokwim West Room. As
                of now, we have three legislators confirmed to attend: Senator Johnny Ellis, Representative John Coghill,
                and Representative Mark Neumann - although, Kelly tells me that Senator Ellis has invited others.

                The event is not expected to last more than 10-15 minutes; but, if a crowd shows up, you may invite the
                legislators to speak on behalf of their bills, and this would undoubtedly lengthen the event time. It is
                difficult to predict the attendance at this time.

                I will bring a printed copy of the remarks to the event for you. Please let me know if you have any
                questions - thank you!
