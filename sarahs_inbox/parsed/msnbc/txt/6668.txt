            Well, now I think it's sorted out. We were asking for the Governor
            to be in ANC, but apparently would have been happy to have her in
            JNU.  So here's the request:

            Is the Governor available on May 9th , which is State Employee
            Recognition Day for about 30 minutes to make remarks to all of the
            employees who have been nominated for Denali Peak Awards (about 85
            total Statewide) and to present the 15 awards to those in Juneau,
            hopefully in the Governor's Conference Room so that we can
            "participate" from an Anchorage video location.   About 70 employees
            will be at the Anchorage location (which is still being determined).
            We will schedule the event for the time she has available on that
            day. We would like to keep the videoconferencing going until the
            folks in ANC have received their awards, rather than ending at 30
            mins. when the Governor will likely need to move on to other
            business.

            (The May 9th date is based on the "National Association of State Personnel
            Executives (NASPE) characterized as "State Employee Recognition Day.  The web site
            is http://www.naspe.net/index.cfm?PageID=20
            It was initiated in 2001 by NASPE and the National Governors Association (NGA).


            Thanks and sorry for our part in any misunderstandings.

           I understand that there is perhaps a bit of confusion regarding the
           employee
           awards.  To be clear and so that everyone is on the same page - the
           request
           was to have the Governor in Anchorage " for just an hour" the week of
           May 1st
           or May 7th . Since there are no plans to have the Governor in

            Anchorage, I
            made the determination that since those dates are critical to our
            AGIA
            efforts and ensuring the Governor's availability to legislators,
            etc., it
            would be difficult to arrange for a trip to Anchorage for an awards
            ceremony.

            I was told perhaps it could move to the week of the 14th, but that is
            the
            final week of session and will be equally as challenging since the
            Governor
            is expected to remain in Juneau during that crucial week. At that
            point, I
            was told that if the Governor couldn't be in Anchorage, perhaps the
            ceremony
            could happen in Juneau and the Governor could honor the 15 from
            Juneau (of
            the roughly 100 recipients). My understanding is that I am still
            waiting to
            hear if that is truly an option.

            Thanks,
            Meg
