              Mike- between things like this, and lack of pressers telling Alaskans what we're working
              towards (for them) throughout the day/week, to the most cumbersome and time consuming
              State of the State writing process, to "the Gov's office was not available for comment"
              happening too oftenn to last minute talking points crafted - well, I'm pulling my hair out
              with communications needs. There needs to be progess there asap.
