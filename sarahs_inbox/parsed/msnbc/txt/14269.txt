           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on the birth of Trig! I have a bio son, 6 1/2 who has Down syndrome, and
           2 years ago we adopted a then almost 7 year old with Down syndrome from Hong Kong! You
           will have so many joys in your life with Trig, and you wouldn't choose to have him any
           other way!  The people who express sympathy are ignorant because they lack information on
           Down syndrome.  Shame on them. I wish you the best of health and happiness for Trig!

           Sincerely,

           Liz Shrauger
