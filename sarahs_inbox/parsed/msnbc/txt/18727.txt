        Subject :                 Helmet laws


        Hi Leo- want to make sure DOT knows my position on helmet laws - I don't support them and
        that will have to be factored in as we're asked to give input on federal mandates and
        their potential effects on budgets. I'm not alone in opposing mandatory helmet usuage,
        many of my gubenatorial colleagues also oppose, though I'll do all I can to encourage
        helmet use.



        Also, I understand that Menzies may have told Ketchikan folks that we CAN afford another
        bridge option? He needs to be careful not to be inconsistent with the admin's position on
        the bridge. Randy and/or Russ can speak to him if he's not clear on our message (that you
        delivered well in Ketchikan) that the feds aren't going to pay for it and it can't be the
        state's priority. Do you need me to set something up with Menzies so he understands our
        position on the enormous DOT needs around the state, thus the danger and unfairness in
        getting Ketchikan's hopes up again?

            Sorry, I got tied up, and didn't see others' efforts - I edited substantially from the original, and including
            some major rewites and major deletions (comments on some points included).
