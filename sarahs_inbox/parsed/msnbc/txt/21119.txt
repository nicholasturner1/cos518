          Do any of the times below work for you to see Becky H in my office next Monday?



          Just got back to Nome from Shishmaref. Went there today as we were weathered out of Wales.

          LG:




          Becky can meet with you next Monday at either 815a (prior to your conference at 9 that the
          Governor is speaking at), at noon (directly after your meeting with the Gov, scheduled to
          end at 1145), or after 3pm. You have the afternoon blocked off as do not schedule since
          you are headed to DC the next morning.




          I told her to plan on noon for now, unless you decide to pick another time. You also have
          a 115 with the British Consul General.




         We could bring lunch up from Dianne's if you want, or just let her know it will be a
         "working lunch" and to bring something with her if she wants.
