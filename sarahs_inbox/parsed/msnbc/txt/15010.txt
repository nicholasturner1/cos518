            Sharon- see below

            It doesn't make sense to go out to bid when there's this pending litigation, no Corps
            permit, and no updated cost estimate for the project.

            Governor:



           Yes.   Litigation has been underway in federal court regarding the National Environmental
           Protection Act (NEPA) and other federal law issues such as the Bald Eagle Act for over a
           year.   A decision by the federal district court in this case is likely in about 3-4
           months.   That decision will address SEACC's request for a permanent injunction stopping
           the project, and SEACC's claims that the project violated NEPA, etc.



           The new case / litigation we expect to see in federal court will relate to the Corps
           permit, if and when it is ever finally issued by the Corps and the EPA.



           Thanks,



           Randy
