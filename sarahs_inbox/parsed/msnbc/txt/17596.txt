        In addition to Nizich's comments, I would add that sport fishing groups are putting
        pressure on NOAA to reject one of our candidates in substitution for a sport fishing
        candidate.  We did originally receive a letter from NOAA requesting all user groups be
        considered including sport fishing when making our selection. We did and forwarded names
        of individuals that are focused on protecting the best interests of our communities not
        particular commercial fishing gear types. Ed Rasmussen is currently on the Council and is
        widely known for being a sport fish advocate.



        We are standing by our appointments. We have solicited the assistance of the
        congressional delegation.  Denby is drafting a letter to the Secretary of Commerce to
        support our candidates and show that all interests are represented. We will ask the
        Secretary to help ensure that NOAA does not reject our candidates. In addition, we have
        solicited the assistance of various groups to advocate for our candidates.



       Mike

        I am writing to request that your respective principals communicate = their support to the
        Secretary of Commerce for Governor Palin's nominations = to the North Pacific Fisheries
        Management Council.




        The Secretary is receiving pressure from recreational groups = which are insisting that
        one of the Governor ' s appointments have a = specific recreational perspective.
        Apparently , they are now = threatening litigation if this does not occur.




        We have previously apprised the Secretary of the rationale for the = Governor's
        nominations.  In addition, we have enlisted the support of = various Alaska fishing
        groups, some of which have already sent letters .& nbs= p;



       I don 't think that the Secretary will disapprove either of = the Governor ' s appointments.
       There is no precedent for this, and one = or more members of the NPFMC have a recreational
       perspective.




       Further , we doubt that litigation would be successful . = However ,       federal officials
       sometimes become risk averse when litigation = is threatened.



       In these circumstances , strong expressions of support for the = Governor ' s nominees could
       go a long way in averting unnecessary conflict = between the State and the Department of
       Commerce.



       Thanks for considering this request .   If we can provide any = further information , please
       let me know.




       Please note that my email address has = changed . My new email address = is
       <mailto:jwkatz @ alaskadc . org> jwkatz @ alaskadc.org. = Thank you ._
