                    Subject: Arctic Power/Your Proposal

                    Regarding your .recent proposal concerning funding for = Arctic Power, we
                    have discussed this among ourselves and have come to the following
                    conclusions:

                    * There is a continuing role for Arctic Power in Alaska's energy = education
                    effort. Accordingly, we propose to fund Arctic Power for = an additional
                    year at $120,000 and will amend the Administration's = reappropriation
                    language to reflect this. =20
                    * This sum should be utilized for the maintenance of a website and the =
                    maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of information. The = principal
                    audience for this effort will be the media, organizations , and = individuals

                outside of Alaska. =20
                * It is our understanding that Adrian Herrera will be retained by Arctic = Power at
                a monthly salary of $7,500 and that an additional $2,500 will be = utilized for

                =20
                * We do not think that it is necessary for Arctic Power to re-open its = DC office.
                Employing available technology, the website and = other information functions
                can be performed in Alaska, hopefully using = your current office. =20
                * It is our understanding that Arctic Power will maintain its Anchorage = office
                through funding sources other than the State grant. =20
                * We do not propose to fund a sub -contractor to act as a liaison to = organized
                labor. We have developed other means to accomplish this = purpose , and the
                position of organized labor concerning ANWR is = pretty well known at this time.
                =20
                * We would like to see Arctic Power expand its message to include = energy
                education generally. This message would include ANWR but = would be broader.
                The State' s central message at this time is that = Alaska contains vast quantities
                of oil and gas which we are = ready and willing to supply to the nation . ANWR is
                an essential = component of this message , but other issues may be included from
                time to = time. =20
                * Arctic Power ' s work should be coordinated with other State = sponsored efforts
                currently under way. Accordingly , we propose to = include Arctic Power in our
                various meetings / teleconferences with the = State ' s contractors and other allies
                involved in the energy education = campaign. =20
                * Early next year, the State administration and Arctic Power should = assess
                progress to date and seek agreement on AP ' s future role. =

                I hope that the above approach will be satisfactory to = Arctic Power. Please give
                me a call if you would like to discuss this further.
