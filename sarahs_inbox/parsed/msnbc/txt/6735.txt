            Attached is a memo regarding the nominations with some brief background information. I will begin vetting the
            names this week and speaking with references.

            The deadline for appointing a judge is Friday, June 1.

            Anchorage and Kenai District Court nominations will be sent to the governor 's office in 2 weeks.
            AG Colberg , if you have any key preliminary questions I can ask the nominations please feel free to pass them
            on.

            I will provide packets to each of you.
