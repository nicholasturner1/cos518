                I called Bob this morning and he put me on the air. His idea is that 5 to 10 non-profits could participate; the ADN
                could also participate by having it published w/the non-profits listed and cut-out raffle tickets for folks to mail in
                w/the $100. With ADN's circulation of 80,000+ they thought the 30,000 tickets could be easily achieved and the
                potential for more money raised. I told them great idea; we're continuing to explore; and we'll keep them posted.

                  I have been up all night.

                  I have it all figured out with the jet.

                  Its so simple...it's scary.

                  Yes, still the raffle idea ...but...

                  I have figured out the logistics.

                  Please call,

                  This is good....REAL good.

                  -Bob
