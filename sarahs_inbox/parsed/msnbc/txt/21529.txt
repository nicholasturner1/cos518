             MESSAGE:

             I  am appalled and disgusted that you have decided to ACT AGAINST THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
             AND ALLOW AERIAL HUNTING OF WOLVES - THE PEOPLE OF ALASKA HAVE VOTED TWICE AGAINST IT. IN
             ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE LOWER 48 - THOSE WHO ARE OUR TOURISTS - ARE JUST
             AS DISGUSTED AND APPALLED AT THIS PRACTICE. WHY DON'T YOU ACT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF
             THIS STATE WHO ELECTED YOU.
