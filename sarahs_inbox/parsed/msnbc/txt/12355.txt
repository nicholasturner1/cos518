             RR called your ANC office today looking for me. I returned his call and he wanted to
             clarify that I would be willing to speak at the Repub convention on Fri morning March 14.
             He said in an earlier conversation that you were welcome to speak at the same time as I
             (that was the first question I asked him a week ago when I was invited to speak, whether
             you had been invited as well--to which I didn't get a definitive answer ). That's when he
             had said you were welcome to speak ahead of and at same agenda time as me --so he avoided
             telling me straight out whether you had been directly invited. Were you??
