          Governor - Pat Toomey just called and asked if you would call him directly. 610-360-6838.
            Mr. Toomey wants to speak with you in regards to: Alaska Politics. He said that if a
           call needs to be scheduled then we can go through his scheduler Stacey. I would be happy
           to set that up if needed. Janice

              It was third-hand. A former staffer with a buddy on the Slope told me. His contact is somebody at BP
              that's up there.. .and the BP person learned of it this afternoon.

             Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision fixes...

             I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M Hill that are currently under contract with BP and tasked with
             corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more than 100 people. An announcement is expected to
             be made tomorrow and the personnel informed. The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety
             concerns with winter work. Sorry I don't have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand just a few
             minutes ago.
