                   Ivy,

                   I am sending this in momentarily.


                   One important fob for governor is the appointment of a cabinet Surrounding yourself with good
                   people with a common vision isn't always easy. The Governor's Decision to appoint
                   Commissioner Kopp is the right decision and its her decision. No one likes to get fired or do the
                   firing. I'm certain that it would have been much easier to stick with what's been "working," orstick
                   with the status quo. In all of this, Commissioner Monegan was given a respectful alternative.
                   He chose to get publically upset.

                   It takes a smart leader to understand and communicate a common vision for Alaska. It takes
                   a tough leader to act on that vision . Governor Palin also keenly understands that inaction rarely
                   leads to growth or improvement. She is hying to make our government more transparent
                   and efficient by taking some action. .

                   Those who call for an explanation ' to this change ought to know that discussing personnel
                   decisions can unnecessan7y compromise laws and reputations

                   / imagine it would have been much easier for the Governor to work within established burocratic
                   norms by retaining CommissionerMonegan. I look forward to a leaner and stronger public safety
                   sector under new direction. To a man who came up from the ranks, good luck in your new
                   position Commissioner Kopp.

                   Phil Schneider
