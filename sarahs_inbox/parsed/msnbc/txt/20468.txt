                 Subject: Katz and independent counsel

               Dear Governor Palin,
                  I have asked my staff to do everything they properly can to expedite to process to obtain counsel for you.
               They are examining whether it is possible to get this list to you before Thursday.

                    You probably already know, but at lunch Mr. Katz announced to me that he and Sheri (sp?) (who was also at
               the lunch) were just married yesterday in Anchorage. They had been together for twenty two years and he
               wanted to be married here rather than in DC.
