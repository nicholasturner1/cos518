Top Secret:

We got a call from the Army recruiting officer in Jnu. Alex was selected 1 of 400 fball players in the
nation for the All American Bowl. They're surprising him in 1-2 wks with the announcement at school
w media coverage. Out of the 400 they'll choose 90 to play in the Jan.3 2009 game- we'd find out in
Dec. if he makes the final cut. He's the only player in AK to be selected. It's hard for B and I not to
tell Alex or anyone else!! The Army Sargeant Goldfarb said I could tell you and the Governor.

Todd,



 If the project started in July, it wouldn't be completed until the middle of Sept.(2 112 mos.). Nizich
has the project scheduled to begin August 11th-earlier if the House & the contractor's are available-
contractors being the tricky part. Aug. 2 would work.



 It would be great to include the kids in the event-if that helps with your scheduling.



Are you judging in the Slush Cup today (Alyeska)?



Thanks,

E

Todd,



Just wanted to run this request by you again:



 Former First Ladies' Tea at the Governor's House. Requested dates are Saturday July 19th or 26th
(Saturday, August 2nd would also work).



 It sounds like a wonderful event to celebrate Alaska's 50th Anniversary. I think the main thing is
whether or not you're still interested in hosting this event and if any of those dates would work, then
we can work with Cathie Roemmich from that point on figuring out the details. I copied her email
below.



Thanks,

Erika

 Email Sent from Cathie Roemmich:

Dear Erika,



It's always nice to chat with you on the phone.



 Per our conversation regarding a possible date for a First Ladies Tea, we understand that as of early
August the Governor's House will be closed for plumbing upgrades and so have chosen July 19 or
July 26th as possible dates. If these dates don't work for Mr. Palin we would also consider Aug. 2nd.



 Capital City Celebrations is a sub-committee under the umbrella of the Juneau Chamber of
Commerce and was organized to co ordinate events leading up to and celebrating Alaska's 50th
Anniversary.



 As we are new at this we would welcome your advise on invitations, hotel accommodations and air
travel requirements. We want this to be a very special and historic event for Mr. Palin as well as the
past First Ladies.



 Alaska's 50th Anniversary of Statehood will be getting nationwide attention and we hope that having
this event documented is also acceptable to Mr. Palin.



 I would love to sit down with you to discuss details as soon as you get approval for us to continue
with planning.



Thank you so much for your time and effort on this.




                                                   4                               ROSTON 02337
