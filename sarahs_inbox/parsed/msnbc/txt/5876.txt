         Governor:



         You have asked: "Denby: did you do a formal emergency order on the pred.

         cont. issue?"      This is with regard to language in the two previous "wolf

         control" initiatives, from 1996 and 2000.



         Below is a lengthy explanation of the two initiatives, and subsequent

         amendment by the legislature, by Kevin Saxby of our Attorney General's

         office.



         The upshot with regard to your question, however, is that the 1996

         initiative language was subsequently amended by the legislature in 1999, so

         there is no longer any provision or requirement for the commissioner of

        ADF&G to declare a "biological emergency" in order to conduct operations

        under existing statute and regulation in "wolf control areas."



         So, no, I have not issued a formal emergency finding or emergency order.

        But, yes, we are in compliance with state law.



        Clear as mud? If you need anything else, please let me know.



        DL.

         I hope this helps. Its probably not as concise as you were hoping for.

         I think you should forward this freely to your staff, and especially

         to

         Matt and Kim, as I know Dr. Titus is planning on preparing a technical

         paper that addresses this history later this year. Please let me know

         if

         I can answer any other questions.
