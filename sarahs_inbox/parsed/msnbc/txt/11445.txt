                 Subject: Mayor Isaacson

               One main issue mayor isaacson is concerned with is getting $1 million in general funds for environmental work on
               Phase I of a railroad project . The project would realign track through North Pole and part of Fairbanks to
               eliminate about 18 railroad crossings . The railroad supports the project. It is Phase I of a much larger $300
               million dollar realignment, but can stand alone as a needed improvement from the larger project
