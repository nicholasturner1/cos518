            Hi Randy- would you look at this first request of Ross'... I'd forgotten to ask you about
            this issue some time ago. And forget his second request- I'm not into clemency right now.
            Thanks!

               Re: Glenn Highway Re-alinement       ( Milepost 92-97 );   and Petitions For Executive Clemency




               Date :   4 April 2008




               Dear Sarah:



               I hate to try and put more on your plate but there are two matters set forth below that
               need your attention . The first is pressing and the second . less so.



               First : There is a re-alignment project on the Glenn Highway between Mileposts 92 and 97.
               A.I.C. has the contract . The problem is set forth in the attached letter from my dear
               friend of almost forty ( 40) years, Rex Close .   ( By the way , Rex is a strident supporter of
               yours .)  As I understand it, A.I . C. needs a permit from DNR to locate its bulk asphalt
               plant to mix the paving material for the job .    A.I.C. wants the bulk asphalt plant near
               the present stock pile of specified road paving material while DNR wants the plant
               somewhere else because of flood plain issues and the chance of excessive rain. If the
               asphalt plant is placed away from the paving material supply, extensive ( and expensive)
               trucking of hot mix will have to occur .    In addition , there is a potential danger of the
               mix being adversely affected by the extensive trucking which could extensively delay the
               project itself.



               I would deem it a personal favor if you could get the permit issued so that the mixing can
               be done near the current stock pile of paving material .   I also would appreciate it if you
               could call Rex Close at 907-745 - 8886 to at least discuss the situation with him. As
               stated Rex is a special friend of many, many years and he knows what he is talking and
               writing about . I also think he's be thrilled to hear from you.




                                                                    2




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01 _0015333

            Second: My office has filed a number of petitions for executive clemency. The Pardon
            Board advises us that the Governor's Office is not addressing these petitions and, indeed,
            has not addressed them since Governor Murkowski's precipitous actions caused the
            Legislature to amend the provisions regarding executive clemency. Once things calm down a
            bit for you, perhaps you could take a look at that situation.



            Thanks Sarah!     Keep up the great work you are doing! It is fun to see you Governoring!
