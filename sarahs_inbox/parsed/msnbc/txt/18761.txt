            There are a few defining moments in every family's life together and I know last night was one of those in the
            Palin family . We so appreciated being able to share that one with you, Todd, your family and friends.

            As for the mayor's speech .. . 1 saw it on YouTube last night ... kind of surreal to see my words (and Kate's too)
            coming out of her mouth in front of hundreds of people . My hope is that somewhere along the way she 'll actually
            take to heart what she read from the speech about living intentionally , making good choices , and "cultivating
            character." :)

            Oh my goodness !!! I just saw the coverage of your speech, copied by the mayor! You should feel honored? :)

            Thanks so much to you and your family for sharing precious time with our family tonight.
