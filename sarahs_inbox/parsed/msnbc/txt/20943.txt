         Governor,



         Leo and Emil would like to meet with you this afternoon in follow-up to their meeting with
         Ron Miller.  I can schedule this for 2:30 p.m. after your NEA meeting.



         Also, Commissioner Galvin is available to meet with you this afternoon and walk through
         the ACES bill before they release. If you would like to do that, I can schedule it for
         3pm or 3:30pm.



         Kris
