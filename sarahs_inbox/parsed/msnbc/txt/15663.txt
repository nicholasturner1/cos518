                      I stink at golf. But I can caddy.



                    We're on our way to Squarebanks. Pray that Todd catches the young guys.

                   Kris,



                    I asked Sarah if she was interested in attending a Korean Community golf event per
            the request of James Shin of Peters Creek Chevron .     Sarah said she would like to attend if
            she was in town and to schedule through you .     I found out from James today that the golf
            tournament is June 28th at Eagle Glen golf course on Elmendorf AFB. I let James know I
            would contact you to see if it fits Sarah's schedule .      Please let me know if it is a go or
            no go .   My cell is 227 - 5483 and James contact number is 727-5183.



                   Thank you, Kurt
