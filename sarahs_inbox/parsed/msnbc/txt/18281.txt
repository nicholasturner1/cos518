         Dear Mr. and Ms. Morton:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

         For far too long this state has been driven by the "Good O1' Boy" network , with corruption
         and ineffective government the inevitable result. Your even-handed use of the Line Item
         Veto has brought a needed ethos of honest , responsible government to your position . You've
         undoubtedly caused many on both sides of the isle to release their lapdogs , but it's only
         a sign that you're doing what's right . And for that , it takes true courage . Thanks, also,
         for recapturing a sense of what Alaska used to be about.

         Paul & Jeannette Morton
