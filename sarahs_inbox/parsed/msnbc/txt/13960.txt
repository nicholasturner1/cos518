                 Dear Governor Palin,
                       I am sometim         ure what you already know, in the event you might not be aware, the head of the Office
                 of Public Advocacy Privileged or     riday. Right now it is fairly discreet. It has the potential to be newsworthy.
                 If you are already aware then ere is no need to say more at this time. If not, let me know and I can give a more
                 informative heads up. Talis
