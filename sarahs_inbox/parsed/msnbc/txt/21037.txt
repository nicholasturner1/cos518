          Importance: High



          All:



          Many of you may have already heard about the recent GMD flight test,

          however, I've attached two press releases on the recently successful

          U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Boeing lead Industry team GMD flight

          test conducted on September 28, 2007. This test is the seventh

          intercept for the GMD system and demonstrated the capabilities of

          America's only operational long-range ballistic missile defense system.




          Thank you for your continued support of Alaska's missile               defense

          program,   and please enjoy this great news with us.




          Best Regards,


                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0006178
