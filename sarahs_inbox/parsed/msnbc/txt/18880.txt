             Gov's office here had a call from Ketchikan Borough Mayor Joe William 's office. He wants to speak to the
             Governor asap. I called to get some follow up and the Mayor's currently in a press conference on Gravina. Their
             news director will give us a call or send us any press release , points, etc that they have which I'll forward as soon
             as I get. His # is 254-0134, but I hope to have more details shortly.

             Not sure what Sen. French comments are based upon . We've been pretty clear that we were persuaded to move off a pure
             gross after reviewing new information we hadn't known about--modeling based on real costs and the effects on projects-in
             light of the guiding policies of fair value for Alaskans and good investment climate.

             Pls let me know if you hear more.
