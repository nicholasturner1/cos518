              (907) 226-2400

            MESSAGE:
            I am the president/CEO of KRD, Inc. (a small high-tech firm in Homer). On July 17th we will have some of our
            Department of Defense (DOD) customers here to evaluate the under vehicle inspection systems we are developing.
            As busy as we are (which is good), I seldom take the time to let anyone outside of our customer base know what we
            are up to.

            I thought the governor's office might like to attend the meeting to find out about KRD and our systems . The meeting
            will begin at 9:00 AM and end no later than noon.

            As a brief background, we have 15 employees, all degreed and all high-paying jobs. And we are entering another
            growth curve, preparing to manufacture our systems (preferably in AK) and sell them to DOD, corrections,
            Homeland Security, etc.

            Please let me know if anyone from the governor's office (we'd love to have the governor herself) can attend.
