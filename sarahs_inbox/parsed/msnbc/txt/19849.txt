              Here's what it looks like so far_ Jessalynn and Andy - please if you can work with the
              rest of the folks on this e-mail to finalize and send out tonight - they may have edits.
              One thing that we need ASAP is 800 numbers for all senators - needs to be added. I
              am going to have to get out of the loop in about 10 minutes due to an event on behalf of
              the Governor. Please give all edits to Jessalynn. This e-mail is going to go to the
              Governor's newsletter list (2,021 people), mayors and cities - unless any of you have
              any objections to that. Please give your feedback to Jessalynn.
