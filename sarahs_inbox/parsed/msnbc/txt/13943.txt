             Kris- pls call Mayor Keller and ask her again for her last year's justification for asking
             for the town's top priority: emergency kitchen in the Complex to meet FEMA match (or
             however it was justified through the legislature). She and district lawmakers need to
             justify that as it was her #1 request... I'm getting heat for that one still and she/Lyda,
             Vic didn't really have to explain it when I didn't veto it lat yr. It wasn't vetoed thanks
             to regional balance needs in the budget process, the local and federal match helped too.
