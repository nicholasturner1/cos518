            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Sara:




            I have lived in Alaska since 1959 , living in Fairbanks , Juneau , Bethel and Anchorage. I
            support your stand on the budget .  There is too much pork and entitlements.    the
            legislature need to stop the waste and take care of the primary issues which are public
            safety , health, and schools. My family supports you all the way to cut the waste and
            misuse of State funds.
