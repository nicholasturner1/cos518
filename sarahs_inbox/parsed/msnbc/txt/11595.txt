               MESSAGE:
                      Tom Kriska told me that Todd was running the Iron Dog again. Good Luck to
               Todd! The defending Champ. I hope your family is well and especially Track, I was
               in the military and it can be challenging at times. The reason for this letter
               however is for you. I hope you are not getting burned out, we, and I mean we, are
               happy with your service to us. I wish we could do more than simply thanking you.
               Governor, you sure have put the vision back into the people. Please, keep up the
               good work and thanks for your sacrifice. You won't be forgotten. Mike h.
