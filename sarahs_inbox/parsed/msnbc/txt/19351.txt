                 Subject: Speaker Pelosi

               Speaker Pelosi 's office called. The Speaker would like to call you today ; likely in regards to the letter you sent
               her. They do not have a specific time and asked if there was a good number to reach you at over the next few
               hours. Would you like me to give them your cell phone ? Or would you prefer they call here and we transfer the
               call to you?
