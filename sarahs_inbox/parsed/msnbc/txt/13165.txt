            MESSAGE:

            As a staunch supporter of the Republican Party & Sen. John McCain, it is my belief that
            you would add much to the GOP Ticket! Here's hoping you'll consider the V.P. position if
            offered.  Also, what are the chances of getting an autographed picture? If possible, send
            to:
