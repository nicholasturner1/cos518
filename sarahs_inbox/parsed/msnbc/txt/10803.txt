            MESSAGE:

            Dear Govenor Patin,

            You have asked for suggestions for spending surplus monies. I hope that some of this money
            could be applied to increase staffing for Fish & Game. In the last two years, I have
            witnessed illegal snagging of salmon on Willow creek with help too far away to respond in
            time to be effective with catching the people that are guilty of this. I also became aware
            of a young black bear being shot(in my neighborhood/subdivision) because it was attracted
            to garbage in an open trailer. This event was reported with no response. Shooting a cow
            Moose with calves in a subdivision was also reported with no active response. It is very
            sad to see precious wildlife unprotected & to see our parks, State or otherwise, poorly
            suppervised & abused. It would be my hope that some of this money could find it's way to
            increasing trained Fish & Game Officials to enforce the rules that protect State Parks &
            wildlife. Thank you for your time & consideration.

            Sincerely,

            Patricia Eckhoff
