         Subject:                  Mega Prision


         Good to see you last night at Moose Dinner , Commissioner Schmidt.



         I'm anxious to hear more about the mega-prision vs regional expansion . I know we're in
         total AGIA mode, but soon will have to make decisions on the issue. Thanks for working on
         iti And we'll set up a mtg either in Juneau or Anch to go over any new info.



         Again, thanks for your good work on that and so many other issues. It's interesting to
         consider the mega prision issue in a light that can shine on hard numbers and rising
         costs.
