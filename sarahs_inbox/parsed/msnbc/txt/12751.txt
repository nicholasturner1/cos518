            Governor and Mike(s):



            Late yesterday evening the Board of Game approved a predator control program for the South
            Alaska Peninsula Caribou Herd which will entail the use of helicopter access by state
            employees to control wolf predation of newly-born calves on the calving grounds.  A draft,
            but likely to be issued soon, news release (SAP NR) is attached for your information.
             Also attached is the regulatory package approved by the Board of Game.



            This will likely hit the press this afternoon.



            FYI, DL.
