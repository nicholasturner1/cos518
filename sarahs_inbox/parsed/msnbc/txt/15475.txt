           I did talk to carol but I got an email from her saying she was stunned by how many school
           projects were actually cut. So she wants to talk with me about what she can do in the
           future. Karen

           I've gone through Sean's story. It is definitely misleading. Service High's turf. And
           Sharon, for another example, he mentions a cut of $1.1 m to Covenant House without stating
           they received $3.9...but he clarified that the recycling center recd $lm of their request
           for $2m. And, Karen talked w/Carol.

           Sharon we need adn to correct re: vetoing astro turf - we did fund at $d00 g the Anchorage
           requests. Not sure what else Sean missed- we should all look and he needs to correct what

           Good point. I expect we will hear more about that. Hopefully the initial flap will die
           down after a couple of days. Karen

           For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
          capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or
          understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operating
          budget. Privileaed or Personal Material Redacted
        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




           The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the
          process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
          her budget.



           Just my observations.
