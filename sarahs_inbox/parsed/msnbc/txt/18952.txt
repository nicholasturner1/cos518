         Governor-



         The folks at the Permanent Fund Corporation have been scaling back the annual banquet for
         several years now.  What started as a small dinner for the corporation's staff after the
         annual meeting, ballooned into a huge event. For the last several years, they have not
         required the fund managers to attend the dinner. This year, they decided not to have the
         dinner at all. Furthermore- they would like to distance (not meant to be harsh)
         themselves from the actual announcement.  They realize that they are the money managers
         and we (the state) are the distributors. They feel it is only appropriate that we take
         the lead on the announcements.



         They thought the announcement in Valdez was great and appropriate!



         I will clarify this with Sheila Toomey when she gets in at 1:30.
