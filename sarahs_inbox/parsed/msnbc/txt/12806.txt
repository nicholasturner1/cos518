           Ms. Showalter,

           I'm following up with my original request to Lt. Governor Parnell about

           his position on the current condition of the Dept. of Public Safety.



           Our association watched as the VPSO program received a significant wage

           increase to assist with recruitment, retention, and better service to

           the citizens of Alaska.



           I'm sure that Lt. Gov. Parnell is interested in seeing that same

           increase in service provided by Alaska's Finest and will insist that

           Gov. Palin and Comm. Krietzer see that it happens for Alaska Families.



           I wait anxiously for his response and position on this matter.

           God Bless,

           Steve Lantz
