          We are so proud !     Great job!     Your boys are awesome!



          I loved the article about your sons (though they should have added your precious daugther
          in there, too). Reading it gave me goosebumps.



          Cool picture of Eddie, too.



          Can't wait for next weekend' s game . If people need a place to stay, despite the drive
          they'd need to make to watch the game in Anchorage, let folks know they can camp at our
          house and save some hotel $$$.



          Todd and I will be down Wed night it sounds like.
