            I would love to! I think it's a great idea -- and definitely an exemplary project John is
            undertaking . Thanks for thinking of it!

            Mark- Have we done a letter acknowledging KMBQ's cool efforts to run their local station
           off green energy? They've been in the news lately on that. If not- let's do so. Thanks!
