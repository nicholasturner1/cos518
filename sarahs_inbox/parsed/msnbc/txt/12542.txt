               Governor -

              Channel 13 is looking for an interview on your NGA trip . Fox Business News is looking for another
              Exxon Valdez interview - at this point we don't have satellite confirmation so I'm not sure that will
              work. And Steve Quinn wants to know if you can call him after hours to talk about the state
               republican convention and Ben Stevens serving as national committeeman.
