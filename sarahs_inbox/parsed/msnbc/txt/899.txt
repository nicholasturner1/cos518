Hi Todd,



I'm filling out your TA for your trip to Juneau and need to write in the purpose. Will you be meeting
with anyone from DOL or for any work force issues? If there aren't any specific events or meetings to
use, we can always use meeting with the Residence Manager to discuss phase 2 of the plumbing
project as a purpose or other House related issues. If you know the time and date of when you'd like
to return to Anchorage, let me know and I'll take care of the ticket.



Hope you're recovering well from the Iron Dog!



Erika
