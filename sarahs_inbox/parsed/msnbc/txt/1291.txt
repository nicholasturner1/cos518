She never said the baby would be with her all the time. When we hear she's above the law, how
many state employees are 24\7 beside her and you guys plus a few others

MESSAGE:

Gov. Palin and office staff,

This is to express my concerns about a baby accompanying the gov to work

every day. As nice as it is to bring your child to work--what new

mother wouldn't like to bring their baby to work--it is unacceptable

behavior and most people would be fired if they brought a new born to

work. U.S. labor law allows for maternity leave for this very reason.

The fact that the Gov thinks that she is above the law and doesn't need

maternity leave and feels Hike she can disrupt gov business with the

presence of her child clearly demonstrates her lack of judgement and

leadership.

The state of alaska business will suffer as a result of Ms. Palin's

foolish decision.
