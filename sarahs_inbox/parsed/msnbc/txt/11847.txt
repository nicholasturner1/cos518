           I'll just need to know when you decide on the time and have a rough idea on numbers.
           Unless I hear otherwise we'll have beer, wine, coffee and beverages available and the
           usual food.  Thank you!!  E

           as long as we've got tvs set up and food available I can keep the table stocked - we don't

           of me inviting people to the house ... it seems like they interpret it as a big deal if
           they think staff will be called in for OT or it ' ll be a burden on staff ... So, I think Ivy
           and I can handle folks stopping by. Ivy - how many do you think?
