MESSAGE:

I have a suggestion for your baby's name. Since your children's names are unusual, I thought the
new baby's name should be Field; then your son's names would be Track and Field!!!
Congratulations to you and your husband and if you

need a baby sitter in the Anchorage area, we're available anytime. Nancy Lumpkin
