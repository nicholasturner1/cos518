                 I was just checking our slats Oft morning to make sure we were still ahead of Minnesota . The Presidential Challenge webske revised the state ranking to reflect participation
                 levels instead of the raw numbers . Alaska is number 1 in participaticnIII IIItl Can you belIeve it? The governor should be proud of us.
                 Also, after my e-mail yesterday. more employees signed up. We now have a 31% participation rate in the Department of Law (174 people). That is fantastic.
                 I will send an e-mail to the entire office, but 1 couldn't wait to tell you the good newel
