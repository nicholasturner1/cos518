            We're going to be so behind, as they'd like to see, to convolute AGIA.



            I can talk to Karen today as she 'll be in Anchorage and I'll be in for the Dr Greene mtg
            and Energy talks.



            We can't let this be a cluster. We all need copies of budget(s) so at least internally we
            can start scouring it. We'll find out Thursday if Cabinet has does any work on it, as I
            assume COS has been "on it" with instructing them to do so.



            Kris- would you get cookies or something for Cab mtg. Gotta get them in a good mood. Pls
            get a special one for Joe S. We'll use him as our "he's doing it right" Commissioner and
            I'll ask him to share what he's going through w the union, his budget, his critics, etc...
            but how it's all good for the State, ultimately.
