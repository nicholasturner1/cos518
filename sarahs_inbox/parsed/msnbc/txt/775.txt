  Governor and Todd -

  Invitation for the Governor and Family to participate in the Santa Claus Express with the Anchorage
  Firefighters and ride in the fire engine one evening around town. This is requested from Dec. 15 through
  Dec. 24. We need to pick an evening so that I can coordinate with the ANC Firefighters.

  A request was also just received from Jenni Ragland, The Salvation Army - ANC. On Thursday,
  12.20.07 @ 2:00 p.m. Wal-Mart Officials will be presenting $25,000 (500 gift cards) to the Salvation Army
  at their Dimond/Old Seward store. ANC is one of eight communities selected from across the country.
  They would love the Governor to participate in helping families receive these and help them shop.

  Thank you, Janice
