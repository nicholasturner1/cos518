           MESSAGE:

           Please forgive my lack of formality, but may I say that you are AN AWESOME GOVENOR! I
           appreciate all that you do for the State of Alaska and its residents . You are the first
           politician that I have felt actually cares about people!  Thank you!




           Regarding the "$1200 Stimulus Check" that you are proposing...



           I think its a wonderful idea. However, I have a recommendation. For those who are on
           Welfare, I feel that $1200 should be divided between their Gas/Electric and go directly
           into their Utility accounts. That way, this great gift that you are proposing is not
           abused, but being used for the sole purpose of the check.




           Thank you for taking the time to read my view. God Bless!



           And a hug to baby Trig!
