          Governor Palin Disappointed Over Mat Maid Decision




          June 13, 2007 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today expressed her disappointment
          with the Creamery Corporation ' s latest vote to ignore the Governor ' s proposed solutions
          and close Mat Maid ' s doors on July 7, 2007.




          "I am very disappointed," said Governor Sarah Palin. "Our proposed solution last night to
          provide only milk from our local dairy producers keeps the doors open beyond July 7th and
          helps our dairy producers and farmers as well as our consumers. The fact that the
          Corporation refused to even have an open serious discussion on the State's proposed option
          this morning is unfortunate."



         The State's local only, milk only proposal was based on the financial information that the
         Creamery Corporation began providing the State.late last week. It was also based upon the
         Corporation's request last April for $600,000, which the Corporation said would give many
         months of funding for dairy operations.



         Right now, 72% of Mat Maid's milk is imported from the Lower 48. The Governor sent a
         letter to the Chairman of the Creamery Corporation, Mac Carter, last night suggesting a
         local only, milk only solution for our dairy producers to keep the other 28% flowing.



         Additionally, the Governor tried to tour the Mat Maid facilities in Anchorage today on her
         way to Global Food Alaska - 2007 on the Kenai Peninsula . Access to the facility was
         denied.

                                                                  1

          The Governor will further pursue the State's options in the matter.
