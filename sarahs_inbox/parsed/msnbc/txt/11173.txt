            Governor,  Your SOS was wonderful. The content was great and the delivery very real and
            passionate about Alaska and our interests. Several of us watching on Gavel to Gavel found
            ourselves clapping throughout!  You are amazing.  Have a good trip to Track's graduation
            and Congratulations to him and to you and your family on his success as well.

              Marty
