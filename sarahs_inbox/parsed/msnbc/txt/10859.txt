                Mr. Stroman, I concur with the Holzman's position on this issue. Why is DOT in such a hurry to
                implement a management plan when there is no recorded/verified incedents of conflicts between aircraft
                and watercraft. I've been on the lake for 18 yrs and have yet to see an aircraft have to make a go-around
                because of a conflict with a watercraft. This proposed lake management plan is not needed. Once again
                DOT has failed to notify property owners in a timley manner.... makes one wonder about your motives
                and what's really driving the train?
                Regards,
                Gary & Dixie Boyd

                Hi Ron,
                Please tell me what authority you are using to waive the 30 day notice period as required per AS
                44.62.190? A PUBLIC WORK SHOP, ('TO HELP WRITE A WILLOW LAKE USE PLAN THAT WHEN
                IMPLEMENTED WILL ALLOW SAFE USE OF THE LAKE"), is a very IMPORTANT MEETING, AS IT
                IMPLIES THAT THE USES OF THE LAKE WILL CHANGE.

                We the public NEED NOTICE, so that we can plan our time to participate in these meetings. I think that is
                why we have AS 44.62.190, so that the BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC CAN BE SERVED.
                Again, I ask you what date did you post the notice of the meeting in the Daily News?
                I know you posted the notice on the State of Alaska's "On Line Public Notice" on January 3, 2008. That
                gives us 5 days notice which is not sufficent notice time.
                I still have not received the notice or the draft plan, that you mailed, what date were they mailed? No one
                I know has received your notice.

                After 40 years of DOTS NON-MANGEMENT of the lake why are you pushing this so fast. Our last
                meeting was on October 10,2007. You had plenty of time to plan the next meeting with a full 30-day legal
                notice period. Huggins and Neumans office just stated that they would be sending their representives to
                the meeting as they are both in Juneau.

                As a property owner, I can not help but feel that DOT is trying to push off their agenda on us without our
                full knowledge or input, we know that "DOT OR AVIATION HOLDS THE TRUMP CARD", BECAUSE
                YOU HAVE TOLD US MANY TIMES.
                Willow Air Taxi is not operating on the lake until next summer. Historically,there are no
                recorded accidents with aircraft on the lake, WHAT IS THE RUSH?
                I agree we need meetings and solutions that meet THE BEST USE OF STATE LANDS/WATER.
                Thanks, Linda

                  Good day Ms. Holzman
                  Notice has been posted and published of the up-coming workshop. I've checked with Central Region and they
                  say the letters did go out to everyone so I hope you've received it. Notice of less than a month is typical for
                  public workshops. We were trying to set this meeting up so that Senator Huggins and Representative Neuman
                  could attend, as people requested-the session starts soon after.

                  Please let me know if you did not receive the draft plan.
