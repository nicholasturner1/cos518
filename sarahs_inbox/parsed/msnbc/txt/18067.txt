         Governor,



         Do you know Griz? He's from the Valley (Houston area) and wants to be plugged in. He's
         been emailing me for a couple of months now. Sounds like he knows you, but obviously
         wanted to double check. Important part highlighted. Hope you're resting up today.



          "Thank you for taking time from your busy day to talk to me.

          My Fireworks business takes me to almost every Chamber of Commerce in the State. Also
         Fair organizations and Towns and Cities requiring a gala affair see my smiling happy face.

          Have campaigned for Sarah in and around the Nome area where I had worked extensively
         years ago. I worked with and believed in Her while She served as Mayor of Wasilla and
                                                                   1
