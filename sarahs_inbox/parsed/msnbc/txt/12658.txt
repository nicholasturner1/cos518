            Governor Palin announces appointment of Steve Haagenson as Energy Coordinator




            Governor Sarah Palin announced at a noon press conference today in Juneau that she has
           appointed Steve Haagenson of Fairbanks as Energy Coordinator .  Haagenson will also serve
           as Executive Director of the Alaska Energy Authority.




            Haagenson retired from his position as Golden Valley Electric Association's President and
           CEO in November 2007 after a 32-year career with the Interior Alaska electric cooperative.
             During his tenure at GVEA, Haagenson worked his way up through the ranks, working first
           in a part - time summer position as a staking technician before moving into positions in
           engineering and operations .   The GVEA Board named him President and CEO in 2001.




            Haagenson served on the Alaska Energy Policy Task Force and has been a longtime leader in
           the Alaska electric industry .  In 2007 , Alaska Power Association presented him with its
           Mason Lazelle Achievement Award , the highest level award conferred by the trade
           association membership , in recognition of his outstanding contributions to electrification
           efforts in Alaska.
