              Governor,
       I
              If you have the time I think it would be good to offer a "short" meeting

             packed into a busy schedule.          Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             you wish.     Tom

              Let me hear from tom /marty first. I'm willing to meet with them, as they

              requested yesterday, but may be advised against it if they're just going

              to'clobber us with criticism. Tom/Marty- what do you recommend - Bowles

              may NOT want to meet, afterall , but I' m game for making the overture.

              Could happen after our energy mtg?

              Governor - I called Bowles office to let them know that you would not be

              available per your email earlier today.    Would you like to have a

             meeting set for Anchorage tomorrow? Janice
