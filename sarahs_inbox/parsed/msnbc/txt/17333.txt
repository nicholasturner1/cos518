           Bruce Knowles from Mat Su Fish Advisory insists Yetna, Fish Creek escapements are being
           ignored by F & G.

           He wants this addressed. He insists F & G is "all Comm fish". They're very concerned.

           He's threatening, or promising: "Emergency petition for escapement goals will be submitted for
           the April 16 meeting (B of F), in the next couple of days."

           This is also coming from Wayne Ross, evidently. (Per Mr. Knowles.)

           Just got off the phone with him. He's ticked.

           FYI - phone call I made to him was a courtesy to Wayne Ross - and the phone call didn't go very
           well.




           Don't pick lemons.
