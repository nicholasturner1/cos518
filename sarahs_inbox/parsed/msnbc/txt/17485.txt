            Kari, if convenient for you, it's probably best to do this from Juneau. Please let me
            know if I can help further.

               Thanks so much John! What an amazing accomplishment of our Senator. I can

               All is well. I'm in AZ for an educ symposium. And am praying for Agia to pass so
               we can get on with finding AK's gasline partner.

               Good to hear from you.

               In view of the attached article from Congressional Quarterly= , I thought that you

               Senator in the history of the Senate and on = your status as the seventh longest
               serving Senator ever.

              Your longevity is admirable on its own merits , but what you have done = with

               that tenure is even more impressive. Your mastery of a broad = spectrum of
