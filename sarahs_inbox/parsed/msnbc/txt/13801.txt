            J- pls set up phone call for me to speak with Mike Burns this morning- just real quick,
            I'll touch base with him on what a Gov's authority is re: investment/divestment of Perm
            Fund $$$.  He hasn't asked, but he needs to hear from me on my opinion - and no one seems
            to know what a Gov's authority is in this issue is but I will go on record with him re:
            Perm Fund divesting the half of one-percent that we've got in Darfur. Thanks



            Russ -you can let leggies know I'm still trying to talk to Burns.

            Russ- if you get a chance to talk to Gara or Lynn, let them know I do support their
            efforts on divestment. I haven't known what they needed of me, but I'm not impressed with
            Mike Burns avoiding the question and giving Alaskans the of "not available for comment"
            comment.



            If asked, I'm telling Alaskans I still desire to have the conversation with Burns to let
            him know my take on this (but he hasn't expressed interest in knowing what I'd like to do
            on this issue) and I side with those who believe our "bottom line" shouldn"t be our sole
            global concern in this matter.



            If I can do anything to help those lawmakers, even if it's just taking a public stand on
            this, I'll do so. They can suggest ways I could help. Thanks
