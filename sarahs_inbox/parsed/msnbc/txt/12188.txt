                CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY COMMUNICATION

                AG Colberg:

                Updating the AEA & AIDEA executive director searches . Commissioner Galvin attended yesterday 's AIDEA &
                AEA board meeting to help establish the plan for conducting the searches.

                AEA - - the board reviewed 8 or 9 resumes and selected 5 applicants at the 2 /14 meeting. The board will
                interview these 5 applicants on Monday February 18. The board intends to recommend 2 or 3 applicants to the
                Governor, with the board ranking the applicants ( 1st choice, 2nd choice etc.) The Governor will then select the
                candidate, possibly next week.

                AIDEA - - the board authorized AIDEA to hire The Growth Company to conduct an executive director search - -
                (advertise the position , screen applications and make recommendations to the board , draft possible interview
                questions, etc.) That process will continue ; the first ads might be published this weekend . The board (hopefully)
                will select a new AIDEA executive director in the next 1-2 months.

                Please let me know if you desire any further information.

                Brian
