         I could only do this, I believe , as a stop -in... nothing that I would want them to prepare
         for or make time for me ... I'll just stop in on my own if I can squeeze it in, but don't
                                                                  1

          Governor - I just received a phone call from Frank Bailey and he had a call from Duane
          Bannock with Division of Motor Vehicles . The Division of Motor Vehicles is having a
          system program training seminar for approximately 80 employees tomorrow , Wed., 10.03 at
          the Marriott Hotel . This is an all day seminar . Mr. Bannock was wondering if the
          Governor would be available to stop by for a quick " thank you for all your work" to the
          employees . I will call Mr. Bannock directly if this is something that we think can fit in
          for tomorrow . Thank you , Janice
