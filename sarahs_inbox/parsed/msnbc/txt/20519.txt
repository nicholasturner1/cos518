               Good quote, thank you.
               Regarding another aspect of all this recent APOC complaining issue on both predator control AND the
               mining initiative:
               If you want to personalize my quotes more (if you believe it helps), say: "Alaskans expect me to give an
               opinion when asked, which is what I do in exercising my First Amendment rights when I'm asked about
               important issues affecting our state ," Patin said. "I haven't hesitated in giving my personal opinion on
               predator control and the mining initiative, for instance, because Alaskans know by now I'll take a stand
               and share my opinion if they ask to hear it."

              "I'm pleased that APOC's commissioners understood that the information we prepared was non-
              political and that we never intended to take sides in the debate on the ballot measure ," said Denby
              Lloyd, Commissioner of ADF&G. " There has been a huge amount of public discourse on and public
              interest in predator management, and we knew, as did the Board of Game, that Alaskans would
              need factual materials about these important programs at this time of the year."

              Governor Sarah Patin agreed . "It is part of the mission of our state agencies to inform the public
              and to make sure they have access to the facts ," she said . "When both sides of a political debate
              are making claims about an important public policy issue , our experts must be free to explain these
              programs to the public."
