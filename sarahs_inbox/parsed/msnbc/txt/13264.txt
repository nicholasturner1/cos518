               Governor.

               In addition to your planned trip to McNeil River this summer (July 25-28, for four people), I'd like to invite you to
               attend , or even be an invited guest speaker or judge , at one or more of our Becoming an Outdoors Woman
               (BOW) camps . These are tremendously popular camps that introduce women to outdoors activities , including
               hunting , fishing, food preparation, camping , boating , and shooting.

               For information, you can refer to the following links:

               If you wish to participate , you could stay for the entire camp , for portions of a day , or simply for a cameo
               appearance during one of the many functions. Last year, I attended the session at Lost Lake for the better portion
               of two days, and one evening they had me judge the moose calling contest (fun and funny for all involved).

               I believe that you would enjoy the BOW, and I know that the staff, volunteers , and participants would be honored
               to have you join them.

               Please let me know.

               Thanks, DL.
