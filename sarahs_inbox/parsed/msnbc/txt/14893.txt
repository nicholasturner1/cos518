             Governor Palin:




             I just wanted to let you know that I am pulling for you to be Sen John McCain's Vice
             Presidential choice for the 2008 Election.



             i am exceedingly impressed by your work, family traits and proven professionalism in
             governing the Great State of Alaska. You would be ideal as the next Vice President of the
             United States.   Your high morals, can-do spirit and great love for America are exactly
             what we need in Washington.



             As a 26 year Air Force retiree, I am alos very proud to see your son enlist in the US
             Army.  May God bless the young man and protect him as he goes in to harm's way.



             Continued good fortunes as you serve as Governor and hopefully one day soon you will joing
             Sen McCain as our White House team leading America to an ever higher plateau of
             excellence!



             Very Respectfully,




                                                                    1
