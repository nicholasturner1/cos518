           Governor as you already know the e mail you sent me on juneau access which I forwarded to
           mal menzies has ended up with sen elton and printed in his newsletter.
           We are trying to find out what happened but somebody has really jumped off the deep end
           here and I am going to do my best to find out what happen. It goes without saying I feel
           terrible about the situation. Leo
