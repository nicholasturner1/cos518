         1. You've got an invite from principal Wendy Taylor to visit Glacier View School by Mat
         Glacier. Great place to stop and have lunch with kids.

        2. In Glenallen region, Copper Center seems to be most hurting, dysfunctional area. Most
        of Glenallen' s OCS cases and trooper domestic calls originate there.

        3. Native v non Native issues simmering . Came up several time-- one example ... swim lessons
        operated by tribe with fed dollars offers it free to Native children, 60 dollars per kid
        if you are non-Native.

        4. Roads definitely need work.

        5. Glenallen High has a shop for shop class that isn't used during summer. Could be
        leveraged for workforce devel training?? School construction coming along well (adding
        elementary wing to new high school wing).

        6. Ahtna-State land issues simmering. Have to talk another time.

        7. I get people telling me what a breath of fresh air you/we are. It's all positive from
        that aspect.

        Just arriving in Valdez.
