              I think it is a nice thought to hold public hearings in communities

              affected by changes in the Ferry service .           This should be consistently

              applied especially in Prince William Sound Communities. I don't recall

              any public hearings on our ferry service reduction. We wrote hundreds of

              letters directly to the Governor and Commissioner even without hearings.

              I haven't seen a response to any of them. A public process where all the

              letters are received and discussed would be a good idea. A lot of PWS

              residents are still pretty upset with the reduction in our ferry service

              and don't feel like we have been heard.
