              Governor -

              I have received word that for Thursday, 06.26. 08 (road trip ) - DPS has a Turbo Prop - Single Engine Plane
              (Caravan) - 2 pilots that is at your disposal. You have flown in this same aircraft last year when you flew into
              Skagway. It is an 8 seater.

              They can pick you up on Thursday , 06.26. 08 at the Wasilla Airstrip at approx . 11:15 a.m. for Soldotna . This is a
              45 minute flight You would land I mile from the Soldotna Sport Center.

              The Soldotna to Homer Flight time is 20 minutes. Then from Homer back to Wasilla is a 1 hour and 15 minute
              flight time. This would takeout the 10-12 hour drive time that you would be on the road . Something for you to
              consider - Thanks, Janice
