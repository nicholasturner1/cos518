           Yes,



           Jack's on board. Wanted you to know he was already serving, otherwise we would've looked
           to place him before some of the others.



           Thank you!

          Yes...all of the AWIB names. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I worked closely with Click,
          Paula, and then with Greg Cashen on Click's request last night/this morning. They are the
          appointments they want, and their background checks come in clean.

            Has Commissioner Bishop weighed in on any of the names?
