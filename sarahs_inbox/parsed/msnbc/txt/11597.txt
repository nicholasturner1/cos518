                 Subject: Options for Bed

               Hello Governor,

               The two options for the tanning bed are:

               1. Install the bed in the basement next to the dryer and share the 220 outlet with the dryer.
               The bed would fit against the wall where the table is currently located; plugging and unplugging the bed and dryer
               would be necessary as an extension cord cannot be used with the 220 outlet. (The Housekeeping table could be
               moved to the Kitchen Prep room.)

               2. 220 outlet in Cedar Closet (Additional breaker box to increase capacity to 3rd floor).
               Benefits to the House:
               The third floor breaker is at capacity ; it would be beneficial to increase capacity for future use verses the
               basement where it isn't an issue. This option would allow for additional circuit loads on the 3rd floor to install
               washer/dryer during phase 2 of the plumbing project. The state would pay for the replacement of the breaker box.

               Anchor Electric: Cedar Room $3,252.35

               It would take 1-2 days to schedule the electrician and a few days work to have it up and running.

               Please advise on how you would like for me to proceed.

               Thanks,
               Erika
