                       DNR has scheduled a hearing that will begin March 3 to allow the Point Thomson
             unit owners; ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Conoco, to present their ideas about alternative
             remedies to unit termination.



                          In    her December 26 order, Judge Gleason said that DNR correctly rejected the
                                                                       1

              unit owners ' plan of development.



                        The judge also told DNR to provide the unit owners with an opportunity to argue
              about any other remedy besides terminating the unit, that may be appropriate in light of
              the rejection of their plan of development and consistent with the law.



                        The Commissioner of DNR will hear their arguments , look at any written materials
              they submit and decide what the appropriate remedy is for failure to submit an adequate
              plan of development.



                        DNR will make a decision and send the case back to the judge by the June 15
              deadline she set.




              Also - I called Doherty ( ADN editor ). He is haying the Bill White , who originally wrote the
              story , call me back, but he said it sounds like they need to do a correction and may send
              someone to the hearing . The correction will be that it is a hearing, not a meeting, and it
              is with all of the unit owners , not just EM.
