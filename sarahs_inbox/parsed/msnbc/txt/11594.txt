               Janice,

               On Jan . 7th, I spoke to Dr. Cathy Baldwin Johnson on an inaugural Pathways to Hope : Alaska , Native Summit on
               Child Sexual Abuse conference that was occuring that same week in Anchorage . Due to the Govemor's
               conflicting schedule, she was unable to attend . Cathy did not mention or email me anything about a trip to
               Juneau . I just called Cathy and left her a voice mail on her cell phone . As soon as I hear back, I'll let you know.

               Janice, for reference that number is Privile e
