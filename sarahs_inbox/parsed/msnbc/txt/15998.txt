               Randy,
               Linda,

               I'm writing to clarify my public records request I'm requesting documents the governor's office has sent to and
               received from KABATA since April 12. In particular, I'm looking for about 80 pages KABATA recently sent the
               state in response to a request for more information about the Knik Arm bridge project.

               Thanks,
               Kyle

                       Jim:

                       In your capacity as counsel for KABATA, please advise if I may release the most recent document
                       provided by KABATA to Mr. Kyle Hopkins . That document contains responses to some of the due
                       diligence questions posed by the administration to KABATA. It has been marked "Confidential Deliberative
                       Process Privilege" by KABATA. Mr. Hopkins of the Anchorage Daily News verbally requested a copy
                       yesterday. I believe Kyle spoke to someone at KABATA yesterday and was told that KABATA did not
                       object to the release of the document. If that is inaccurate and KABATA objects to the release of the
                       document, you may also want to confirm with Kyle whether or not he wants to make a formal public records
                       request for the document from KABATA, and appeal KABATA's decision.

                       Thanks,

                       Randy
