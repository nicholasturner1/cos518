            Thanks for traveling up here Talis, Mike, Kris, Kel... and for working all hours, all the
            time!  I appreciated spending time with you last evening, thanks for letting me think out
            loud with you re: this latest issue. I appreciate your patience, wisdom, and the grace you
            show me as I express concerns. Thanks!

                I'll see you flippin' burgers in a, couple of hours. ;)
