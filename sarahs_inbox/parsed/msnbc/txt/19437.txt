              I think it's great. If anyone has anything else, that's fine... but it looks to me like its good to go.

               Sorry for the computer glitch. The attachment of the draft in WORD may not have made it through this
               morning . Here is a slightly more polished version. I tried to put a few sentences in to remind readers the

              Dear Gov. Hickel, Mr. Roberts, and BackBone, et al.:

              As you have all failed to respond to my 24 hour deadline to not use my name in any advertising you are undertaking
              under the names of "B1311 1", "BBII", "BBI", "Backbone", or any other entity under your control, this email is to give
              written notice that tomorrow, Monday, July 14, 2008,1 will be retaining legal representation regarding the use of my
              name in your advertising. My name is not to be used in current, planned, or unpublished advertising of any entity of
              Backbone.

              Yesterday, I clearly asked you to not use my name in any Backbone advertising, and since I have had no response
              from anyone associated with Backbone regarding this issue, my only conclusion is that you still plan to use my
              name, despite my continued requests to stop and decease from using my name, associated with any advertising by
              Backbone and its subsidiaries.

              I have also not received any apology.

              Sincerely,

              Scott R. Heyworth
