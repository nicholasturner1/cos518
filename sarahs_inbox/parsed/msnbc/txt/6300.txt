              Subject : Governor/Natural Resources committee

              You may have heard already, but I wanted to make sure that you knew that
              Governor Palin has been selected as Vice Chair of NGA's Natural Resources
              Committee for 2007-2008. When appropriate, this would probably make a
              good press release.

              We look forward to working with the Governor and you to make her tenure
              as meaningful as possible.
