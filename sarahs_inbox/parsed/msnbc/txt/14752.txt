           So Todd is thinking he'll be able to handle the little fella             ' s doc appt tomorrow :(   then
           he can bring me Trig... so I can tentatively plan on some of              those events tomorrow - I
           assume the LtGov' s 1:45 event should be a priority for me to             stop in?
