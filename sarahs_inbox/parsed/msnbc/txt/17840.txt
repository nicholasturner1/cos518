              Subject : Chris Hayes Resigned Today

            We mailed, faxed and placed a phone call to Chris Hayes today asking her to resign her seat from the AK Human
            Rights Commission . She contacted the Commission this afternoon via email to resign . I will send the email once
            the executive director sends it to me.

           Thanks,
