             Subject:                 2nd Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 14th, 2008




             Dear All:



             APIA, APICDA, and Delta Western are still working together to attempt a

             fuel delivery to Nikolski. The marine charter did not go this weekend,

             due to weather. The rest of the week does not look promising either, as

             hurricane force winds are expected tonight, with the tail end of the

             storm near the end of the week.



             The earliest an air charter could make it would be Wednesday morning,

             weather permitting.      Now that some of the heavy equipment has been

             repaired, the runway should be able to be kept cleared, but fuel is

             short for the heavy equipment too.



             Nikolski has less than 9 drums in the tank. Heating oil is a priority,
      {
             but without electricity, they won't have heat either.



             A new update will follow upon new information, at least by Wednesday.

             Thank you for your attention and interest and please let me know if you

             need any more information.
