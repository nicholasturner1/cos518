               Governor,

               I just read my op-ed in the Juneau Empire editorial ("Turn the Private Sector Loose") and was a
               bit disturbed that the Empire edited out the word "Governor" in front of almost every "Palin." Just
               wanted to let you know that I wouldn't knowingly refer to you just by your last name!
