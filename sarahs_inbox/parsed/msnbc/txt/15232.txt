          It was reported tonight on ktuu that I wasn't available for the interview they requested
          today. I did not know they had requested any interview to answer Nickel's complaint about
          AGIA. If I wasn't available then perhaps an AGIA person should have complied with their
          request. No doubt I'll be asked by them tomorrow to comment anyway - so I'd rather have
          spoken to them today so we didn't have that "no comment" response.



          Also, Kris: are Joey and/or Kristan and/or DNR folks familiar with MatMaid going to
          respond to Samuels' and other leggies' audit findings of today?
