               Just saw in today's paper that Conoco announced plans to spend 1 billion dollars on
               exploration and production in Alaska, nearly 22 percent more than the amount the company
               budgeted for Alaska investment in 2007. The week following ACES' passage Chevron announced
               an increase in capital spending for both new North Slope and Cook Inlet work.
