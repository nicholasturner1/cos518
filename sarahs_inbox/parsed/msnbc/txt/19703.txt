           Subject:                 Revised draft .


           Another draft is set out below.           I used Meg ' s paragraph on meetings.



           Note.  I do not think the draft staffing studies and recruitment studies Walt mentions
           were ever completed. I don't recall ever seeing them. The draft report for 2007 was
           provided but nothing else to my knowledge.



           I apoligize but I am not sure what statement to provide for Mr. Nizich.
