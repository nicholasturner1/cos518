             Dear Governor Palin:




             Mrs. Palin, I just wanted to express my thanks to you for your support of

             our military and the Global War On Terrorism. I'm proud to say that I'm a

             resident of Alaska with you in office, showing your support for us and our

             mission to defeat Al Qeada in Iraq. I currently work (he is in my unit)

             with your son in 1/25 SBCT (Ft. Wainwright) and I'm sure he is extremely

             proud of how you represent us and show the support for the War in Iraq.

             Again, thank you for all that you do as Governor of our Incredible state

             of Alaska.




             God Bless,




             CW2 William "Chip" Steele
