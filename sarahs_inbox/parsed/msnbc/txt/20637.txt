               Dear fellow Alaskans,

               As students throughout Alaska return to school, your state government is working hard to
               help public school students and job-seeking adults better prepare for employment. In light of
               that, I wanted to share some recent achievements and progress with you in my report on
               advancing Alaska education.

               Please visit htty:/ Jwww.gov.state.ak.us/pdf JEducationReport August2008.pdf to find out
               about the progress we've made.

               Until next time,

               Governor Sarah Palin
