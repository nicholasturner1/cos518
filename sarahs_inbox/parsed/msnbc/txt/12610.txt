            MESSAGE:

            Greetings Govenor,

            I have heard wonderful opinions and positive agreements to accomplishments and goals set
            and met through the Govener ' s office both on internet news and " talk radio " and there is a
            rumor that Mr. Mcain may offer the Vice Presidency to you . Although , I have more
            conservative views on many issues than Mr. Mcain , I was delighted to hear that
            consideration of offering the running mate position to you and would like to let you know
            there are several people that I know that were very excited about the prospect and would
            like to assure you of our vote . Ohio is in desperate need of leadership . Thank you for
            your time and hopefully you would accept the offer if it is officially made.

            Eric Montgomery.
