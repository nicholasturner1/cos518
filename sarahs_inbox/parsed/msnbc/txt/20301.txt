          Governor,



          I know you're aware of the situation with Brian and his son. I wanted

          to let you know that I'm heading to Juneau tonight and I'll be there

          when the office opens in the morning. I've ask Mike Nizich to request

          HSS grief counselors be on call to assist staff coping with the

          situation as it continues tomorrow.



          I'll be working with my managers to provide for staff needs, and to

          ensure that all Treasury issues are covered. I'll keep you informed as

          events progress.



          Please keep Brian and his son in your prayers as we await what we

          still hope is good news.



          -Pat
