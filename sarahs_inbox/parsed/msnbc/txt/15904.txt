            Hey, today we need big prayer for the TC-Ak presentation! And do you want to go over there
            to watch, around 10? Can you reserve us a couple of seats on the sidelines?

              Good.

             Stilll can't get over that goof Mike Ross. Truly someone must be egging him on to take a
           negative view of everything we're doing.

             Fyi.... this is rolling. Just a matter of timing as to when they could be available to
           testify.  Tom called last night pretty excited, said Click, Marty, Pat and hour had called
           Ken to set it up.
