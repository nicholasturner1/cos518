Todd,



Are you going to do this tomorrow?: 9:00 - 9:25 a.m. - Mat-Su Job Center - Governor invited to
present (3) certificates of completion for the graduates of the Career Readiness Training. This
request was discussed w/Todd and Thomas Nelson of DOL. If Governor not available they would
like Todd. Time can be adjusted.



They are calling Janice and need an answer.



Thanks,

                                                     1                          ROSTON 01551
