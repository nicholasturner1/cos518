       Yes i remember him - he was our scheduler.



       Dont you think he'd be better than Wagner's "unknown" nominee?



       We always MUST go with people we know, first.



       His number is included in your email - am I supposed to call him? Bc i dont have time to.
       Or is that email from Chuck?

           Governor,

           I I followed up with Griz yesterday . He says he has known you for 15 years , that you guys worked together on
           the city fireworks display , and that he was endorsing you in Nome during the campaign . All of this may, or may
           not be the case . He does however want to be plugged in. He said he believes in you and what you stand for. I
           went through some of the more low key vacancies with him.
