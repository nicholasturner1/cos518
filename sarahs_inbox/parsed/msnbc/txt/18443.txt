         Governor,




         Pat, Joe and I have all been able to read the attachment and have been discussing some
         of these issues.  Our plan is to do a little more work verifying several items and then
         get together first thing in the morning. We will coordinate our comments and get them to
         you.  My hope is that we can do a dry run in the morning going through the talking points
         and the charts. Hope that sounds fine to you.



        Mike

          Talking points look good and strong. Only two or            three comments.
