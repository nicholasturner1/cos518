              Governor,

              I had understood, although incorrectly, that you were aware that this was taking place. I apologize for not
              keeping you informed, I'll make sure that I communicate with you directly.

              I wanted you to be aware that it was Diane and I, not IT staff that moved everything off of your desk. This
              was before we knew that you were returning to the House to pack and we had already begun to prep for
              the plumbing project..

              I can certainly understand your frustration with this and will be more diligent at keeping you informed.

              Thank you,
              Erika

                desks to have access to the computers.

               To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd floor.

                they went in on Monday , August 4th. They had coordinated with Susan from the house as Erika was not available at the
                time. They unhooked the bedroom computer and took it to copy the hard drive . It was then returned back to the house. All
                of staff computers that were needed were copied over the weekend . I was told that the department of law had asked for this.

                  Kelly- pis ask their leg liasion if there's some misunderstanding that the DPS budget was out by lawmakers, thus
                necessitating lay offs (as PSEA has been claiming in their media interviews )... and remind the liasion that we increased their
                budget and no one from admin has directed lay offs and were unaware of any need to pink slip troopers - in fact quite the
                opposite we're anxious to learn of their actions towards an aggressive recruiting plan so they can add more necessary
                troopers. (Karen and Annette have more details if they're unclear on what the legislature did in actually approving
                INCREASED line items for DPS.)
                  Obviously nothing makes sense in the recent media reports regarding claims that troopers will learn their fate today re:
                threatened pink slips, but it will be helpful to learn why DPS didn 't have responses to KTUU last night, why PSEA would
                ever claim that lay offs may be pending (and how the tragic Bonnie Craig murder case would be relevant to this , as KTUU
                suggested), and what is special about August 20 as that's the date troopers will reportedly learn their fate?
                  Very unfair to the public to have all these unanswered questions so it's imperative the answers are quickly assimilated and
                aggressively presented to Alaskans today - so those whom we serve may have the confidence in their public safety
                organization that they deserve , and so citizens aren't left confused as to what we just accomplished with the legislature in
                terms of budget increases and contract negotiations . A press conf with Annette's participation (and DPS leadership) is
                warranted on this - that may be the only way to get the truth out there . Short of that, a press release clarifying and correcting
                all the recent erroneous reports must go out today so I 'd like Bill, Randy and Annette to do that as they get DPS leadership's
                clarifications on the record also. Truly, this is all horribly unfair to the public for them to be deceived concerning our
                intentions and actions with trooper positions . Thanks

                Governor,

                I had understood, although incorrectly, that you were aware that this was taking place. I apologize for not
                keeping you'informed , I'll make sure that I communicate with you directly.

                I wanted you to be aware that it was Diane and t, not IT staff that moved everything off of your desk. This
                was before we knew that you were returning to the House to pack and we had already begun to prep for
                the plumbing project.

                I can certainly understand your frustration with this and will be more diligent at keeping you informed.

                Thank you,
                Erika

                It was only Kami Clark who went into the master bedroom and Todd 's office and she was only at each of
                the desks to have access to the computers.

                To transport them, one other person helped her, but she was the only IT staff to have access to the 2nd
                floor.

                No, I was not told that on Aug 4th this was occurring. Please get more info on this, as its not comforting
                at all knowing this took place with no one present especially. Who are "they"? Who went to the
                bedroom, where else did they go? Please gather more information on this Aug 4th event that occurred
                while I was in Fairbanks. Thanks

                time. They unhooked the bedroom. computer and took it to copy the hard drive. It was then returned back to the house. All

                If anyone has an answer, pls let me know asap:
                I understand that someone recently went to my Gov's House bedroom and to one of the House offices to get emails from
                computers - who, when, etc conducted this search of my bedroom's computer and the other house computer? And what were
                the reasons given and responses given to whomever must have officially entered the residence on whatever day it was that
                this occurred. Thank you
