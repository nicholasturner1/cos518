           Governor,

           1 I followed up with Griz yesterday . He says he has known you for 15 years, that you guys worked together on
           the city fireworks display , and that he was endorsing you in Nome during the campaign . All of this may, or may
           not be the case. He does however want to be plugged in. He said he believes in you and what you stand for. I
           went through some of the more low key vacancies with him.
