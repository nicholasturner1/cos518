Elisa,



Thank for the idea of setting up an on line guest book.We've been flooded with some amazing family
stories from across the state and country from families with children who have DS. I think these
stories should be shared with others, not only with us but with the rest of the state to educate and
provide a positive light for families with children who have DS.



Thanks Todd Palin
