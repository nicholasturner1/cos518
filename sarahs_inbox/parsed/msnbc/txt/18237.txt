         The two hours is total on the ground time that includes transportation to the airport and
         back.  The only scheduled events are an one hour meeting with the Premere and a 10-15
         minute press event. I have tried to keep it as bare bones as possible.



         I just pulled up to the office and I will start making the rounds to keep things
         coordinated.



        Mike

        I don't need two hrs there, tho right? I ,was told it's a 10-15 min presser - what's the
        rest of the visit that's been added? I want to get back to work on my priorities for
        alaska - not canada's railroad idea. I need to be back in Anch no later than 12:30.

        We will be on the ground about 2 hours. We should arrive in Anchorage at 1:00 pm. I am
        told it is a 2 hour flight from Whitehorse to Anchorage (pretty much the same as from
        Juneau).

          Balash is in Juneau. I need to call him here shortly. We planned to meet up at the
         office today.



           The Premere's office asked if you would feel comfortable having the girls go a short
         tour during our hour meeting in Whitehorse.
