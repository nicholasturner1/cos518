                Subject : fire in Kenai

              Walt wanted you to know there was a fire in Kenai and it sounds like a mother and two children died. The father
              and another child were away from the residence . I think Walt said that one of the children was a known firestarter
              but we won't know more about the cause until there is more time to investigate.
