               Good idea. I would recommend that we do so but not get too much into the content
               of your conversation, except for the points in DOI's press release.

                  I have just been told on a confidential basis that Secretary = Kempthorne will
                  hold a press conference at 2:30 EDT today to announce his = polar bear
                  decision. A press advisory will be issued at 11:30 EDT, = but it will not specify
                  the subject matter.

                  At l pm EDT, the Secretary will call the Governor at her Anchorage = office to
                  discuss his decision. I'm advised that this will be the = first call he will make.

                  The Interior officials who contacted me could not discuss the = content of the
                  Secretary's decision. However, I got the distinct = impression that he will decide
                  in favor of a listing under the ESA. = Accordingly, I would recommend that we
                  complete work on the draft press = release as soon as possible.

                  Information concerning the decision will be posted on Interior's = website at 2:30
                  EDT. In addition, I will be briefed and will send = you what I receive.

                  The officials stressed the need for secrecy until the press conference= actually
                  occurs.

                  P.S.
                  On Friday, the Interior Department will announce its decision = concerning the
                  Northeast planning area of NPR-A. Apparently, the = decision will preclude oil
                  and gas leasing in a sensitive area around the = northern portion of Teshepuk
                  Lake while allowing leasing further south. This should not be a problem for the
                  oil industry, which has = shown no particular interest in the prohibited area.
