            Just as an FYI- it couldn't be avoided.. we had a AAA Moving van in the driveway today at about 11:00am. The
            large Butler 's Pantry cabinets had to be moved off site and stored for the plumbing project. Hopefully the two
            photos of the House plumbing project on the front page of the Jnu Empire will help squash any rumors.
