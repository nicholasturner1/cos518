               Hello Governor and Todd,



               Just a quick plumbing update:



               Everything works in the House except for the two items in Piper 's bathroom and the laundry
               sink in the basement . There' s more information at the bottom of this email.



               I have been very impressed with both of the contractors on this project - they' re good,
               hardworkers!!



                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA_GSPO1_0008528
