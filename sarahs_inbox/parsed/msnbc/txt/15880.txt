           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           I am a Ward Chairman from Philadelphia writing to inform you of my public support for
           Senator McCain to request you to be on the ticket for Vice President.




           From the information I know about you, I think you would be an excellent choice for such a
           position of prominence, with your history of fiscal responsibility and real ethics, I
           believe you would be a great asset to the future of the USA as well as helping in
           redirecting the Republican Party to the ideals that the majority of America believe in:
           smaller government, civil liberties and ethics.
