            We don't want to get their hopes up, so I wouldn't offer them anything in the way of a
            comment at this point. I haven't seen the letter, but you don't have to acknowledge that.
            We're working on a statewide high-energy-cost relief plan, I met with Tom Pat Marty Joe on
            it today... Maybe they'd have something to offer re: statewide relief (so we're not just
            looking at Juneau). I'll cc them in.

            Governor-



            The Juneau Empire is asking about a letter you received yesterday from the Juneau
            delegation. In the letter, they outlined why they believe the Disaster Policy Cabinet
            erred by defining a disaster too narrowly. Mike Nizich is hoping to arrange a
            teleconference with you, himself and General Campbell tomorrow at 2 p.m. to discuss the
            findings and options to move forward. I don't have much to tell the Empire at this point.
             May I tell the Empire about the impending meeting?
