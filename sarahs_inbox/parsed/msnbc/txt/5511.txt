       The musher is in the lead by at least 1,000 votes .                 This also tracks with

       ADN's poll.     We are not telling anyone.           Meg & Sharon have a great unveiling

       strategy so we don't want this leaked out.



       The event is scheduled at the Alaska Mint. They are extremely excited.



       Sharon had a great thought on involving the kids with the actual release of

       the quarter in the Fall... inviting all schools to participate. Also, I know

       Sharon is pulling out comments from students for the press conference.

        Subject: Coin



        If anyone has a rough idea on how the coin design vote is going please let

       me know. Also if we don't already have a place to unveil the coin selection

        it would be great to do this with a bunch of kids around. I could easily do

        this with my brother ' s fifth grade classroom at Gladys Wood Elem. Outdoors

        unveiling the design ,     short and sweet announcement with a very large poster

        of the chosen selection would be ideal . Let me know. Thanks



       Many other schools and or classrooms would accomodate this too.
