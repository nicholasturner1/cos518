             Just spoke with both of them. They are very angry, hurt, disappointed and distrustful of
             our process now. They were led to believe their criteria was our criteria in crunching
             numbers that led to their "solution" (that even I got excited about again) that was based
             on gross, that they rolled out for us the other day. They feel very deceived.



             I apologized profusely - and I PROMISED we'd grant their request that their                       scenerios
             WOULD BE run through all the same tests we used . I promised them this.



             Beth also still has heartburn over deduction language- I told her Joe would work with her
             on any specific concerns there and we'd help plug in a better solution if there is one.



             Please grant their request Pat. Have your folks run their numbers,. work with Beth on this-
             she wants to trust us and I want to work with her. Pls let me know how that goes...

                Joe Balash is working on the initial draft. Matt Zencey says a Thursday publication is
                unlikely given his deadline but can guarantee a Friday slot.
