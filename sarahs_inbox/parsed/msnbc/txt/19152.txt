          It could just be a part of their seasonal lay-off plan, esp after their ramped up hiring
          efforts that took them through the outdoor seasonal construction season up there.



          I know quite a few guys who were hired for seasonal gigs.

          Joe,



         I thought I had Bob's cell number but don't. I sent him an email asking for information
        on any layoff of VECO/CH2M Hill employees, but haven't heard back yet from him. I'll let
        you know as soon as I learn anything on this.
                                                                 1




                                                                                                             PRA GSPO1_0005844

          Thanks, Larry .   If you could make that call later this afternoon , it might be helpful.
         While I don ' t have any reason to doubt the person I heard this from , it was third
         hand - so I don ' t think we need to be overly aggressive . But we need to know what ' s going
         on.

          Joe,



          We can probably get ahold of Bob Batch at BP over the weekend if you want more
         information on this . Let me know if you want me to make a call.



          Thanks,

          Larry

          I just received word that personnel with Veco / CH2M Hill that are currently under contract
         with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
         than 100 people . An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
         informed . The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
         winter work . Sorry I don ' t have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand
         just a few minutes ago.
