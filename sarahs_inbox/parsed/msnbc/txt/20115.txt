           Subject:                 TA corrections


           I looked back for the month of April to see how the TAs looked around Trig's birth and I
           find nothing for a few weeks in there. I don't know how detailed the TAs and schedules
           have been kept, but to not see anything in those weeks is concerning. Unless I'm missing
           something, it looks like there are lots of chunks missing in the TA pile.
