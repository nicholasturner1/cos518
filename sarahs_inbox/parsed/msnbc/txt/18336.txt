         Mam,rnYou've soldiers in the Alaska Army National Guard that are state,municipal,city,
         employee that was deployed for 15 months as OIF. We're about to go back to the States and
         we were given one week of President's leave but by merely reading the memo as I understand
         only federal employee that's stated in the memo. We are covered with this leave but with
         out pay. Do you consider your state, municipal, city employee gets the same benefits.
