              Governor,



              I will get in touch with Mr. Hamel to hear his concerns. I am in Washington, D.C. until
              Thursday morning, so might even be able to meet with him if that is preferable.



              Thanks,

              Larry

              It was a good mtg. He's fine about psio funding and is wanting to assist me. He's very
              frustrated tho that he believe BP snookers psio into believing they've got it all under
              control - and slhe still cant believe psio let up on GC 1 fire investigation.



              And Larry- i promised Hamel you'd call him. He at least wants a quiuck convo on a couple
              of issues that he, again , believes we're getting snookered on. Pls call him. Thanks

              Governor,



              Unfortunately, the Hamel letter is a pdf, and cannot be pasted. Hamel is in DC, as far as
              I know.  Jonne will be in the office in 30 mins, and will provide a more detailed report
              to this group then, including a summary of the Hamel letter.



              In short, the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation (given its staffing
              limitations), and pushing BP very hard. PSIO has completed a thorough technical review
              that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak , and the
              final section of the report , an addendum addressing materials traceability , will be
              completed in the next day or two .  We'll send it to Mr. Bewak directly and post it on the
              PSIO website.



              As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
              info , you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr . Hamel ( I assumed that's why you
              asked where he is)

              Per Chuck Hamel's request, I have attached his latest correspondence to Congressmen
              Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier letter to the House
              Energy Committee.



              I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



              P.S.

              Governor , in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with you during
              your DC trip.
