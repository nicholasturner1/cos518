         Ok sounds great. I've tweaked some verbiage to get it down to 675 words, but still need
         the dollar amount plugged in... then I'm assuming all is well with it and it's good to go.
         It's written simply, be too many people are saying they just don't understand how a fiscal
         conservative could propose "taxing" industry. I had to explain the difference between
         taxing and sharing value of our oil. I did keep it simple, purposefully.

        Yes, I sent out but have not heard back on any changes or recommendations. Sharon also
        sent an email asking for info to be provided to her and Beth. I'll start making phone
        calls if I don't hear by tomorrow. Sharon said it is too late to run this weekend and she
        thought Wednesday would be the next best circulation.

        Kris- were you able to get the op_ed to this team? Unless I soon receive suggested
        changes/edits I'll just wait for the blank $ amount to be plugged in to the piece and then
        I'll ask ADN to run it. Then we'll submit to other publications after hearing from ADN.
