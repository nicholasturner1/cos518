              Cam Toohey said the reception is at the quarter deck and that they have a separate room
              for the meeting.

               Is there a location set up for me to meet this Shell CEO here in the Cpt Cook? I'm headed
              in now - I'll be in the lobby until I hear where I' m supposed to go.
