             Argh!

             Pat Forgey NEVER asked me anything about the Permanent Fund report. He wanted to know why some
             information in the reports (no specific report) was redacted. I explained the reasons for not releasing
             personal information, personnel issues, 401 K/IRS stuff. HE never asked a follow up question. This story
             makes it looked like I didn't respond to him.

             This is probably worth a call to the managing editor.

             sounds good.
             please don't let it hang out there with what the Empire wrote, otherwise AP and/or ADN and/or
             others pick it up and run with it, resulting in the public being very deceived.

             Please have them correct it or retract their errors - or pls have an OpEd written that explains our
             position. thanks so much!

              Still not quite sure what the issue is that the Juneau Empire covered today with the "Transition
              Reports Being Held From the Public"-gist article (Perm Fund Division issue from back in
              July?)... but the gist of the article is so disappointing because it's 180-degrees from where I want
              to be with information deserving to be seen by the public. ( Sen. Dyson was mentioned in this
              article, so John - please let Dyson know I was not (and will not be ) purposefully withholding any
              information. Please let me know when you've contacted Dyson on this issue for me so I don't
              duplicate the effort.)

              Meg - if there 's something you can do to help un-do the records withholding issue that at least
              three reporters are sort of up-in-arms about, please do so.

              I campaigned on open and transparent government - I don't know why the issue covered in the
              article today was ever NOT made public... it's not a mistake that was made on our watch, so why
              try to hide it anyway?

              Please let me know where you guys are going with this to help correct the mistake that was
              made in not releasing this part of a transition report . Look forward to knowing what we're doing
              to un-do it, thanks!
