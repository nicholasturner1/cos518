                Subject: CNN after the Hoover Institution Speech?

              Governor-

              CNN would like a few minutes with you after you deliver the Hoover Institution speech. They would
              like to talk about the Exxon case and Federal earmarks. They could meet you coming out of the
              speech at the Intercontinental. You may remember the reporter - Joe Johns - he interviewed you
              in your Anchorage office right after Pete Kott got sentenced! Please let me know.
