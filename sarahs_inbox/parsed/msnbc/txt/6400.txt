        Hi Chuck,



        I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the direction we need to be taking on adapting
        to the effects of climate change. We are working with the University of Alaska. I have
        met several times with Dan White, who is their lead engineering person on climate change
        issues, and on the list of experts you provided. The University's Vice Chancellor of
        Research, Buck Sharpton, has been appointed by President Hamilton as their liaison to the
        Climate Change sub-cabinet.



       If you have time to talk today (Tuesday,) I am open at 2 pm or 4 pm. We have a Climate
       Change sub-cabinet meeting starting at 10 am tomorrow. The morning session of the meeting
       is open to the public. You are certainly welcome to attend. Please see our website at:
       http://www.dec.state.ak.us/public-notices.htm for more information about the meeting.  The
       meeting is at DEC's Environmental Health Lab as described in the public notice.



        If it is more convenient for you, we could get together when you get back in town. Please
        let me know what works best for you.



        Thanks,

        Larry

       HI Larry,



       Thanks for contacting me. Sarah might have told you

       that I just returned from a two week class/symposium

       on climate change and coastal erosion in the Arctic.
                                                                1

        The general feeling among most of the scientists is

        that the earth is going through a natural warming

        cycle (human emissions probably account for only 1-2%

        of it) and that the accelerated coastal erosion we're

        experiencing is decreasing the albedo effect and

        greatly increasing solar absoption in the oceans,

        which in turn further warms the atmosphere and leads

        to even more erosion and permafrost melting. I can

        make this clearer to you when we meet.



        Since this cycle seems to be mostly natural (I know,

        not politically what everyone wants to hear), the

        state's focus should be on adaptation to the changes

        that seem to be inevitable. This is not to say we

        shouldn't be concerned about cutting emissions. That

        should still be a focus; cutting emissions not only

        keeps our environment cleaner, but decreases our

        dependence an foreign fuel imports, etc. . .which is

        another story.



        I understand you've put together an advisory team to

        discuss a lot of what I've mentioned above. I would

        hope that the team would include some of the top

        university scientists we have available right hear in

       Alaska. I met personally with Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu,

       the former director of the International Arctic

       Research Center, and he is more than happy to be part

       of it. He just returned from D.C. after addressing the

       United States Senate subcommittee on Global Climate

       Change and Impacts.        He spoke directly to them about

       everything I mentioned above.



         I will forward an email to you from another UAF

                                                          2

        professor (Dr. Gerhard Kramm) which includes a list of

        scientists and their resumes , who would also be wiling

        to be part of this.



        I can meet with you sometime tomorrow or Wednesday if

        you'd like.     I will be leaving town Thursday for a

        week.



        Thanks Larry,

        Chuck
