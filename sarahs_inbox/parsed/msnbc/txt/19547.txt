                 Sorry to bother you again. After sending my previous email, I received the communication pasted below from
                 Congressman Hall's energy staff person.

                 If you do decide to submit a statement, we could add a sentence at the end of the previous draft along the lines
                 of -

                 Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




                 Hi, John - I spoke to Mr. Hall and he said he'd like to speak to the Governor if she had time in her schedule, but
                 understands if she's busy . Either way , he would appreciate a letter of support for the bill and a statement that he
                 could issue to the press along the lines of how quickly development would start once the land was transferred.

                 Thanks!
