            Subject:                 NGA Application for State Capital Energy Audits


            Governor Palin:



            As you may know, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and the National Governors

            Association (NGA) recently announced the formation of the "Greening

            State Capitols" partnership. The unique public-private partnership

            between NGA and Wal-Mart will offer energy audits of capitol complexes

            and provide recommendations on efficiency improvements and estimates of

            how much energy and money each state can save. I am attaching a copy of

            the application, as well as a copy of the NGA letter detailing the

            process for your review.



            The National Governors Association will help identify and recruit state

            participants. Once a state is selected, it will identify a team of four

            to five experts to assist in the energy audit and implement the

            resulting recommendations. Within one year of the audits completion,

            participating states are asked to provide the NGA Center for Best

            Practices with a two page report of actions taken and resulting savings.

            NGA will catalogue these results for distribution.



           During a two-day auditing process, Wal-Mart will send a team of

            engineering experts to survey the state capitol facilities and suggest

           energy efficiency improvements based on technologies Wal-Mart has

            successfully deployed in many stores, clubs and other facilities around

           the world. The areas covered by the audit will include:



            *    Lighting;

            *    Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVAC);

           *     Refrigeration and other equipment;

                                                                   1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01 0014146

            *       Technologies such as programmable thermostats; 4nd

            *       Building structure ,   including insulation and windows.



            Following the initial audit ,      the engineers will produce a report with

            recommended energy efficiency improvements and estimated costs to the

            state , as well as the potential energy savings and carbon dioxide

            reductions . Wal-Mart will only recommend technologies with a return on

            investment within five years , unless a state specifically asks for a

            different time frame . At a state's request , Wal-Mart will use its

            procurement capabilities to attract bids from interested companies and

            facilitate installation of the recommended technologies.



            We are committed to sharing what we learn about reducing energy use and

            increasing building efficiencies and working with the NGA in a

            collaborative manner we feel we can help accelerate the deployment of

            new technologies and best practices while saving states money and

            protecting the environment.



            I hope that you consider applying for the program on behalf of the state

            of Alaska .     Please let me know if you have any questions.



            Best,
