             Yes.  It appears to be very good for the state, but we have some homework to do to
             completely understand it.

                Joe,

               FYI, I just advised Beth that all press contacts on the Pt Thomson' litigation should go
              to Nan Thompson. This is for several reasons;

               1.  Nan is the DNR ' person most up to speed on the technical , legal issues on the Pt
              Thomson' litigation;

               2.  This Superior Court decision WILL be appealed to the Supreme Court and therefore we
              must continue to be careful with what is said about the case;

               3.  The Superior Crt decision is a BIG win for the State , but, there is a "remand" to DNR
              embeded in the decision , and we need to be aware of that with whatever is said.
              Furthermore , we haven ' t sorted out what this remand requires and what the implication of
              the remand might be.

               Thanks,

               Marty
