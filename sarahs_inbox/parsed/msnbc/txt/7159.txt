             Hello Todd and Governor,

             The contractor needed to revise the original schedule submitted , so I've attached the new one . Please let
             me know if you 'd like to make any changes , or I'll assume that it's fine as is. I've already sent a copy to
             Karl.

             I don't foresee any complications with this project, but my goal is to keep the contractor working through
             and around as many events or family visits as possible- just to provide a buffer zone in case we do run
             into any issues. The contractors are aware that your schedule does determine their work schedule, so it
             isn't a problem if you need to make any requests.


             Thank you,
             Erika
