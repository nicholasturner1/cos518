         Governor, please review this.   I believe that during the audit of MM (which the scope is
         intended be a forensic & business valuation in nature) this information will be
         discovered.  If legislative audit accepts the scope of this project from DNR; their
         conclusions will be made public at some point.

          Please see attached bullets from me regarding Joe Van Treeck ' s contract .  Given his most
          recent letter and requests which total over $200 , 000 plus health , life and disability
          insurance through June 30, 2008 , which are not included in this $200 , 000 figure , we need
          legal counsel to advise us at the next meeting on September 9th as to the proper response.
