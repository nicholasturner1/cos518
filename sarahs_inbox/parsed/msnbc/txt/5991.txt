           Yes.     I forwarded it to Linda Perez and she replied that she would

           answer today from a computer as she was traveling and didn't want to try

           a lengthy email on her blackberry yesterday(she and her husband went to

           Seattle).

           Kari - pls forward to Linda Perez:



           Am I supposed to be charging meals while I am away from Juneau ? Or does

           per diem cover my meals - I haven ' t charged any meals to the state, just

           a couple of coffees while outside during these six months in office. Am

           I doing this right?



           What about Todd's meals if he's traveling for First Gentlemen duties? Is

           the intent for his per diem to cover meals entirely ,      or was he to have

           been keeping receipts for reimbursements ?    What about family?



           I'd like to be real clear especially going into July. where we ' ve been

           asked if we can be away from Gov ' s House during renovations.



           Thanks Linda- sorry to.bug you about policy I'm still not clear on.



           Thanks! SP
