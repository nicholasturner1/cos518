        Fyi...this was Jeff's email after my discussion with him about where he'd like to serve.
        Can he provide any help to the log jam on PPT for you?

       Hi Frank,




       I just called but you must be back in Kindergarten again today!!!!!



       I am going to have to decline. I am flattered that anyone would

       consider me for such a job, but if I were to come back full time, I

       think it would have to be something for which I have more expertise

       and passion.



       Now if any gas consulting jobs come along!!!!!!



       Please pass on my deepest regrets and highest respect to our great

       leader!



       Cheers,



       Jeff
