        Governor,

        I just spoke with the Williams people and they responded by telling me they are at a
        critical meeting in the "Williams decision tree as to whether to participate in AGIA".
        They are asking if they could fly (they are on their coporate jet so they are very mobile)
        to Michigan to meet with the Governor and hook-up us up via phone from Alaska. Is this a
        possibility?

         Marty
