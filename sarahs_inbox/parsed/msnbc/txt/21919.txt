               The supreme court has final state appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters:

                 1. CIVIL APPEALS: The supreme court must accept appeals from final decisions by the superior
                    court in civil cases (including cases which originated in administrative agencies).
                 2. The supreme court may exercise its discretion to accept:

                        b. PETITIONS, from non-final decisions by the superior court in civil cases and from final
                        decisions of the superior court on review of the district court's decisions in civil matters.

                   3. ORIGINAL APPLICATIONS: The supreme court may also exercise its discretion to hear matters
                      in which relief is not otherwise available, including bar admission and attorney discipline matters
                      and questions of state law certified from the federal courts.
