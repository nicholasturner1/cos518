          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin:




          During this troubled time of public scrutiny, just remember , the people still love you.




          This is all just some "ruse" to distract us from the REAL issues, and an attempt for some
          petty government officers to try to get their names in the book. Jealous of your success
          of running the best government this country has seen in 20 years, don't let their actions
          keep you from running an amazingly productive government.




          Please , print this out and hang this on your wall if you 're in need to a constant reminder
          - you're finally a governor who believes the government belongs to the people.

                                                               1
