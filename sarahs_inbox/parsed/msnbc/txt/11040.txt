              I was shocked too when I heard that on the news! We all know lyda didn't invite you-just
              more dirty politics. I'm going to inquire today to see what I can find out. . .keep you
              posted.

             Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
             again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
             lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
