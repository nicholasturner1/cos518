           Governor,




            The attached is the first weekly gasline briefing that will be distributed to the media
           on Friday. This week's topic tackles the $500 million capital match.



            The first attachment is the written version which is lengthier and more poetic. The
           second is the oral version for radio / television that you'll record in the morning.
           Please let me know if you have any changes and I'll amend. The oral version will be in the
           prompter for you when Andy and Jason record unless you have changes.



            Thanks,

            Meg




                                                                1
