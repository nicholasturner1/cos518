            Governor Palin,



            First congratulations on the beautiful addition to your family!



            Second I would like to ask you to please approve the new volunteer fire hall and emergency
            response center for Petersburg.  We are in great need of this new building and require
            state funding to complete it. Please help keep our community safe. .
