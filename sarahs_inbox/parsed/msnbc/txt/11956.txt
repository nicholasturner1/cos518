            Yes, he was all for repealing and he was/is AOIC's lobbyist. There have been some things
            going on - side agreements with exclusions for imaging centers ... I'm not exactly sure.
            Larry was telling me about it. And, I've requested more info to make sure I'm
            speaking correctly. I do know that Larry Stinson is working his butt off on this. I
            receive numerous emails daily that he copies me on that he is sending Anna and
            legislators. And he is working on folks to testify. Also, I've kept in touch a bit w/Jim
            Fruge ( sp?), the guy that I met who is w/Newt Gingrich's group at RGA and I emailed him
            this week on their position. They are totally for CON repeal and he had some great
            commentary.   He told me that he'd be available to talk with me on Monday. Since I had the
            contact already established, I wanted to feel him out first before I directed him to Anna
            Kim. Sometimes I'm leery on where people stand on this and how motivated they are. But,
            boy wouldn't that be great testimony.

           He was totally anti-CON, I felt pressure by him and Bit all the way through the CON
           messaging . Remember Kris- that Fuhs was anti-CON?

            Fuhs is a gun for hire who was very close to Lesil and Tom. I can't remember his stance
            on it through the campaign, but I do remember Bit making comments about how "The Governor
            needs cautiously in wiping out CON.". I'm sure Paul's right in there. Sux that they are
            anti-competition and anti-small business in their efforts to keep it tho.

           Why is Fuhs now testifying on the other side of the CON elimination bill? And all those
           who pressured hard to change CON are awfully quiet now that the bill is on the floor.
           Where are they now?

            Lesil McGuire to undergo ethics investigation



            Thu, February 7, 2008

            Senator Lesil McGuire is to be investigated by the Select Committee on Legislative Ethics
            for possible violations of lobbying laws and legislative standards of conduct. The Alaska
            Public Offices Commission (APOC) this afternoon directed the ethics committee to look into
            McGuire's contract with Providence Hospital in Anchorage in 2003, when she was a state
            representative.
