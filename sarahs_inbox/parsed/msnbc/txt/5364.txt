                We basically take our lead from the troopers or the local police . When they tell us it is not safe to be on the road,
                we will close offices for non-essential employees . This does not happen very often and driving in today, I am a bit
                surprised that they characterized the conditions as bad as they did. Friday seemed worse to me. It does present
                a challenge when all the schools are closed and all the daycare centers are closed . We have many employees
                with little kids that get stranded.

                We have already called the radio stations. KTOO repoted at 6:30 am that they were waiting to hear from
                the State, so I had Nizich call again. We should have pretty good coverage by now.

                 and city government offices will be closed today . We are releasing a statement that all non-essential
                 employees should stay home . Annette will go on the radio and make the same annoucement.

                 The office will be pretty quiet today. The weather will not slow my truck down much so I will be in as
                 usual. Let me know if you will be going to the office as well. I have a number of items to go over with
                 you. Thanks.
