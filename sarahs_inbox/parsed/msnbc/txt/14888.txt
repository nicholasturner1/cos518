            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin:




            Congratulaions on the birth of your new baby boy.



            My husband and I see you as an example for all American mothers. You show the nation what
            pro-life motherhood is all about. Thank you for acknowledging that children are a blessing
            from God.



            Best of luck and happiness with your family and with the beautiful state of Alaska. We
            enjoyed visiting your state last year and hope to return in the future.



            Mike & Mary Mobley

            Spring, Texas
