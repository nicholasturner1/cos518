        Hi Folks:

        Are we gettiny close to moving
                                                Privileged into Anch and Privileges into     the Wasilla Office?



        If he hasn't already been offered the job, pls do so Mike, assuming                     Privileged or   ready for
        Anch constituency work. This needs to happen soon.



        Also, I spoke to Ivy about offering her B and C opening to Privileged or Personal  Hopefully
        that happens asap also. Also Ivy: rest suggestions with [Privileged or Personal Materi, et al in
        your last email re; board seats! Privilege deserves to be on Health. ee        ese olks out
        about your suggested spots for them.       anks!



        Mike - is the gal ready to go as fish advisor? Unless I hear reasons otherwise let's plug
        her in. Who are her enemies - anyone?



        JB - who voted against long. Bonus yesterday?



        i hate being away for so long.             It feels like too far away to be much help. Pls email if
        you need anything!



        The sunshine is perfect - too bad we'll be looking at it through conference windows this
        afternoon.
