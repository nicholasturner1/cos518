              Got it.




              Too bad the gossip column is taking serious any of the "rumors" she hears.

             Since it's a personnel matter, I can't really comment to anyone outside of the Governor.
             Kevin Brooks responded on my behalf to a few press inquiries (not unusual as they were
             Kenai, Duane's home turf) - that we have a different management philosophy. That's about
             all we can say publicly.

               FYI




              Sheila called me today to confirm that Dwayne Bannock was fired by the Governor. I told
              her absolutely not - it was a commissioner call. She also got a call regarding Ron
              Miller.  The caller - mentioned the Governor's father in law's involvement in a utility -
              as a possible reason for Miller losing his job at a time of record dividends. She
              understood, or at least she said, that the decision was made by the board. She hinted
              this might be a news story not an ear item. If you folks want me to add anything please
              let me know. I am not too familiar with this one.



              I let Sheila know that CNBC is coming to Juneau next week. I also told her about Mindy
              Rowland joining the Leg office.
