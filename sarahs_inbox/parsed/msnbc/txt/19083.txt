          Subject:                  Confidential - Spitzer


          Walt- could you provide me any documentation regarding the state ' s settlement of Trooper
          Spitzer's case ( I saw it on the news last night - I hadn't even known that this trooper
          was in trouble again . He's the same one who was stationed in the valley and had a bad
          reputation along with his fellow trooper whom we've talked about before , and this is at
          least the second public case involving Spitzer and allegations of his abuse of power).



          What I need is just the factual info that proves this was a DPS issue and I was not a part
          of any settlement . I was not advised , nor requested to participate in this... as is the
          appropriate way of handling such a case . I ask because I've already heard the accusation
          that "I" settled with a bad cop.




          I'd like to explain factually what an elected official ' s role is in cases like this (that
          being, I had no role in this).

          Thank you.
