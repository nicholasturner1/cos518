               Yes. There must be a response. Work with Sean on it too. This is outrageous.

              Governor,




              State Supreme Court decision 3-2 holds the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional.




              There are 40 states that currently have parental involvement laws

              There are 26 states that currently have parental consent laws

              There are 3 states that have ruled them unconstitutional:

              California

              Florida

              and now Alaska



             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



              More info including the actual ruling are coming, but shall we have Talis work with Mike
              and Sharon on an appropriate response?




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0007331

              Frank,



                          The Governor should be told that this morning the Alaska Supreme Court issued
             a decision in the Parental Consent case. The Court by a 3-2 majority, in an opinion
             written by Justice Dana Fabe, held the Alaska Parental Consent Act unconstitutional. I am
             the attorney for the State of Alaska in this case and I will be happy to brief anyone on
             this ruling.



              Kevin
