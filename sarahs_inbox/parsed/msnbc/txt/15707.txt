              Governor,

              Attached is all of your information for the event tomorrow. I have included your remarks; event info & agenda;
              directions to the event; & a map of the University of AK Southeast campus. There are, however, a few things I
              would like to make you aware of.

                1. SB 57 sponsor, Sen. Elton, is attending and his co-sponsors Reps. Kerttula and Doll, are trying to come,
                     but not yet confirmed. As such, I have included them in your remarks in green so that you have the option
                     of acknowledging them if present.
                2. Commissioner Irwin could not attend the event, but DNR Parks Supervisor Mike Eberhardt (Ebber-hart) will
                     speak in his place.
                3. The location of the event may be a bit tricky, as it is across from the University and does not actually have
                     its own address. Mindy is staffing you and knows exactly where it is, and it might be a good idea to have
                     her ride with you, as she can direct you.
                4. If you choose to ride alone, Mindy will meet you there and will be available on her cell, at Privile
                5. Janice will print this out for you.

              Please let me know if you have any questions whatsoever. Thank you, Governor!
