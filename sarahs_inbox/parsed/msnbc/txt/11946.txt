             Fyi on     Privild   see below.



              Also, if Bluemink wants follow up for her story on what we've done to un-do
            Murkowskiisms, add that we've literally opened doors between Lt. Governor's office and
            ours - and doors that had been previously closed in capitol bldg between third floor and
            everyone else are now open. Same with Atwood bldg. Also, I gave back Regulation Review
            duties to Lt. Governor after Murk took them away from Leman (the appropriately belong in
            Lt. Governor office), along with faith-based initiative seat.



             Also We've reduced security and house staff, we quit renting the house he used in
            Anchorage, gave back the yacht slip in Juneau boat harbor so fish and game had a slip for
            their boat, etc etc.

              Re: Comm position- Nizich assures me it's easy to upgrade and tweak job description if
             the open position needs changing in order to attract candidates - pay, location, duties,
             etc. I don't know if Privll or others can afford to take the job if we require a lot of back
             and forth - unless we upgrade.
