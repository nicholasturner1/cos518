            Hello,

             The books were distributed to the elem. schools in the Lower Kuskikwim (sp?) School
            District.  We only have 3 books left. They wiil be in my office on top of the copy
            machine, unless you'd like me to send them else where.

             I could look into purchasing/getting books if that's somthing you'd like to have on hand.

             Thanks,

             Erika

             too. We ' 11 look for bookmarks for them to hand out in the Anchorage office, and we'll need
             a load of those kid books from the mansion to be transported here so we have them to
             distribute outside of Juneau ( that can wait until we can load them in the king air). Pls
             note on sched what they ' ll be doing for First Family event(s) this week. Thanks
