Subject: Telephone Call




Todd - I just received a call from Nora Bennett , Protocal Office in Ft. Benning , Georgia . She has
gotten word that the Governor may be traveling down for her son's graduation on January 18, 2008.
She wanted me to confirm this information and also wanted to offer any assistance with the visit.
She wanted confirmation , who is coming , offered that you may stay on post and would like to get
proper seating arranged for event.



I told her that due to security reasons I am not able to provide the Governor's schedule but that I
would check with the appropriate persons and would call her back this afternoon. I asked where she
had gotten this information from and she said from other military that they work closely with.



Would you like to contact her directly or I would be happy to do so if I know what I am able to relay to
her as far as where you would like to stay, and number in party. Thanks, Janice
