          Dear Governor Palin,




          I am the grandmother of a 2 1/2 year old little girl named Kenzlee who also has Down
          Syndrome.  My daughter did not get tested during her pregnancy - she was 26 - because she
          did not see a need (The outcome of the test would not have changed anything anyway). When
          she was born, we went through shock, grief (the plans they had would not necessarily come
          to pass), acceptance (this was no surprise to God!), and JOY! We have had unbelievable
          joy with her.. .even her stubborn attitude sometimes! We thank God for her just like she
          is...God has a plan for her and God has a plan for Trig. Enjoy every day-they truly are
          blessings.._..



          God bless you and your family!



          Mary Cordes
