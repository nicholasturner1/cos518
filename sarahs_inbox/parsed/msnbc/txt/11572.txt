                Hi Sarah,
                I want to personally thank you for meeting with John and me during our recent trip to Juneau. Our
                problem of waterfront access and the construction of a new tank farm seem a lot closer now with your
                help and the help of your assistances. The entire community of Gustavus is thankful for your efforts and I
                believe we will find a route forward through this dilemma.

                Thanks so much for your continuing help.

                Sincerely Ken Klawunder - Mayor of Gustavus
