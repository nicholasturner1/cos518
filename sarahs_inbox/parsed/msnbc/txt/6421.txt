            Governor:
            Pam Weaver spoke to you at the Wasilla.picnic about intercessory prayer. She said
            you gave her an email address to contact her. I've known her for years, so she felt
            comfortable calling to see if I could give her the address since she didn't write it down
            when you two spoke.

             Is this email address the one you wanted to give her or was there another email
             address? I'm happy to pass it on to her - I believe her email is:
             akstorknaaol.com, but am not certain. I am double-checking but in the meantime,
             didn't want to waste time - she asked me several days ago for your email address.
