Mr. Palin,

I neglected to give you my phone numbers -- I believe this information is included on
phone lists the Governor may have already received, but I want to be sure that you both
have the numbers if you need any assistance from me - at any time.

Work 465-3876
Home 789-0998
Cell 321-0170

Thank you,
Linda Perez
