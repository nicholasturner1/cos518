MESSAGE:

Hi Sarah and Todd: What better family could the Lord have sent Trig to!!! We have known you
Todd, and your parents, since you were a boy in school in Glennallen. Your dad Jim has always
been Katy's favorite coach. Sarah, we tease our son Robbie that he showered with the Governor of
Alaska. You probably remember the baby boy who helped to chaperon your basketball team. We
know, respect and love you all. Hold your special son in your hearts and he'll grow to be a
marvelous, loving human being. Just as all his family members are.



Best wishes and God's blessings to you .... from the Port Family. Rollie and Carol
