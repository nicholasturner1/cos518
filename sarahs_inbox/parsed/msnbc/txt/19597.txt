            I haven ' t seen a press release from NGA , but = the attached list of Committees states that
            Governor Palin is Chair of the = Natural Resources Committee.



           I'm thinking that, with all of the members of = Congress coming to Alaska, a press release
           concerning the Governor's = appointment might be a good stroke. So, you or Sharon might
           want to = coordinate this with NGA's press office.
