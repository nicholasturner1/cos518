          The Coast Guard is suspending search efforts. They will follow up on

          new information, as it comes in, and they are encouraging all pilots

          in the area to remain vigilent in looking for evidence of a crash site.

          The search has been extensive, and thorough. All survival scenarios

          have been explored, and realistically ruled out. Most likely, they

          went down on a forested hillside, invisible from the air, and

          extremely remote from the ground.

          We remain hopeful that they will be found someday to bring closure for

          their family and friends.

          For us at DOR, we remember Brian.as a good friend, an exceptional

          collegue, and just fun to be around. He will be greatly missed.

          Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
