          MESSAGE:

          Elton questioned Palin's criteria in making cuts, eliminating projects in Juneau while
          approving similar projects in her hometown of Wasilla.



          "I'm upset," he said. "I don't understand it."



          Raising Elton's ire: Cutting $100,000 for improvement to Juneau's Paul Emerson Park, while
          funding a $630,00 kitchen for a Wasilla sports complex. Cutting $100,000 for a new ball
          field in the Mendenhall Valley, while spending $100,000 for bleachers in Palmer.



         Governor Palin,

         I copied the above text from the newspaper article about your budget cuts. You cut 100 K
         for a new ballfield here in Juneau but leave intact 6 and a half times that amount for a
         kitchen at a Wasilla ballfield complex? You cut 100 K for a park project here in Juneau
         while leaving in the same amount for bleachers in Palmer? With all due respect, Ms. Palin,
         you are not Governor of Wasilla/Palmer. You are Governor of Alaska. This absolutely reeks
         of Mat-Su favoritism. Shame on you.



         Sincerely,
                                                                 1
