                In general, all three members of. the Congression= al delegation support roads that facilitate
                natural resource development = or promote commerce between villages.

                I presume that "E-W" means a road that would = approximate an East-West corridor and might
                intersect with a = North-South artery. If so, the closest specific approximation that I = can think
                of is Senator Stevens' previous support for a road corridor in = the Gates of the Arctic Boot, that
                is, a road that would traverse the = southern portion of the Brooks Range. If you can confirm
                that I'm on = the right track with the reference to E-W, I'll make a specific inquiry to = the
                Senator and his staff.

                There may be one complication . If federal = lands are involved, the applicant would probably
                need to use Title XI of = ANILCA, relating to transportation and utility corridors . These =
                provisions are extremely cumbersome and bureaucratic and have never been = used previously
                for this purpose.

                P.S.
                I hope that your visit with Congressman = Boehner's entourage was a good one. Any thoughts or
                = necessary follow-up in the aftermath?

                Enclosed is yet another document that I found and took the time out of my life to do CSED job. This I                    F
                found not only in 2008; but also first discovered it in 2005.

                I was hoping that my case worker would do her job and submit this to the MOA which she never did nor
                did she ever research this site.

                When is my CSED case worker going to do her job?

                It is too bad that I am not getting paid to do her job since I have no job, money, and am now having to
                move back with my parents in Dillingham, Alaska.

                Since I became partially disabled in an MVA in 1999 it has been a hardship on me since I am not able to
                make the money that I use too.

                Any comments?

                Thank you once again for your time.
