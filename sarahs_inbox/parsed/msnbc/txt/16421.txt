           MESSAGE:

           I am 61 years of age and have been a loyal Republican my entire life. Indianapolis is a
           strong Republican State. I am a small land developer and a custom home builder and on the
           Indianapolis Zoning Board. The name of Governor Palin keeps popping up as a possible
           running mate for Sen John McCain. I would like to know as much as possible about Governor
           so I may pass the word around the state of Indiana!!! From all I read, it looks like Gov
           Palin just might be a GREAT choice for the United States. As bad as things are in our
           world and economy, I feel strong we MUST keep a Republican in the White House and in local
           government!!



           Thank you.     Larry J. Walker
