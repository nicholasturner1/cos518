                Dear Governor Palin,

                I retired from the Department of Corrections Sept of 2006 and relocated to Montana to be closer
                to my son and his family. We are not medicare age yet and do not really look forward to the
                headache we feel that will cause with our healthcare.

                We do want to personally thank you for what you are doing to support Alaska's retirees and their
                health care plights. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

                Hope you and your family are doing well and that your new family addition, your baby boy, is
                doing well.

                God Bless you,
                Julie and Virgil Ward
                Life long Alaskans trying to make their way "Out of Mother's womb" (Alaska)
