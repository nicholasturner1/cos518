             He got it. I just followed up w him on the phone. He says AP will follow-up on this story
             tomorrow. I told him it would be nice if he could be so bold to say lyda failed alaskans
             by not allowing the senate the opportunity to vote on waiving the bills. Also, he
             understood you were differentiating between 2 sp sessions-one being AGIA.

            Ivy- pls make sure steve gets this (tho it doesn't explain we're talking about an AGIA sp
            session issue).

            Frank- do we assume Bill will get this?

            And pls make suire this goes to all media, not just ktuu. Wesley needs a flippin follow up
            to make sure he understands what we're saying here.

             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                           No.

             Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request




             April 23 , 2008, Anchorage , Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green ' s request
             to expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin
             today outlined her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can
             show a path to success.



             House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial -birth abortion , and House Bill
             364,'relating to parental consent , failed due to inaction by the Senate .  The Governor
             expressed disappointment that Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option
             during the regular session to move the legislation.



             'Alaskans know I am pro - life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of every
            .human life ," Governor Palin said .  " These issues are so important they shouldn't be
             diluted with oil and gas deliberations."



             Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently than
             last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the full
             Senate.
