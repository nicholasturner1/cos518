             I got it. I talked to Tom. He       was surprised no one has talked to anyone at DNR about this
             issue to get to the bottom of       it. He's providing in writing what the issue is- and the
             legal advice they've received       all along on all AGIA procurement issues , including working
             with the consultants who work       with the Boston firm.



             Any idea why no one, including Annette or procurement folks, would have called anyone at
             DNR or AGIA team to resolve this , instead of thinking the troopers needed to be called on
             the issue first? I ' m still wondering why they . weren ' t asked for the facts on the matter.
