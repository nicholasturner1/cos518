           MESSAGE:

           Dear Sarah,

           I read the wonderful article in the Sunday paper today. Thanks for your value of life,
           your wonderful example in welcoming Trig to your family. Our Benjamin also has DS, and is
           our 5th child. While we considered taking measures limit our family to 3 children, we
           believe that God knew there was room for Kristin and Benjamin in our hearts and home.
           While they both have special needs and it certainly has had it' s 'moments ' and days and
           weeks .... we have a sense of joy at seeing God's plans unfold for us and know that He walks
           beside us in years ahead. Prayers for you today and with a sister in Alaska, it would be
           pleasure to one day meet you.

           Warmly,

           Janelle Julian
