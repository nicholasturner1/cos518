             Do the percentages of savings areas coincide with responses?



             Can we tell where responses came from - did teacher 's union lobby members to response for
             instance ? ( We need to be ready for questions like that, so pls ask yourselves what a
             reporter would want to ask tomorrow and let' s get ready to answer).

             Subject: Budget Survey Results




             The final number of online survey respondents is 10,903.



             We did have a few responses sent via email (they has online "issues") and we are checking
             to ensure that we have ALL entered and counted.

             So this number could rise a bit.



             The attached PDF is NOT Bberry friendly. The numbers for "first priority" responses are:




             CBR 10.9 percent

             Perm Fund 11.2 percent

             Education Fund 25.9 percent
                                                                    1




                                                                                                                  PRA_GSP01_0008275

              PERS/TRS 29.7 percent

              Energy 13.3 percent

              Transportation & Infrastructure 12.2 percent




              So the survey results still dovetails with a savings plan that includes:

              Education 2.6 billion

              Transportation 1.0 billion

              TRS/Retirement 450 million

              CBR 379 million

              Energy 250 million
