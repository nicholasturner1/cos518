            Did you formulate a statement for her yet, based on this email and the other one of mine
            and Randy's?

            Who is responding?

           Governor, I did not say anything without being able to run it by you first. I just talked
           to her and she said she can give us 45 minutes to get her a statement. So it is not too
           late.

           his claim that it was only four.

             I hope you reminded them of every cabinet meeting, every reception , every trip, phone
           call and face -to-face that I had with Walt . There will be many, many instances to cite.

              Again, Walt will be proven to be less than truthful with this latest claim.

               Also notable is all the mtgs / conversations he had with COS, Dep COS , Special
           Assistants , etc. And the fact he was NEVER refused any request to meet with any of us. He
           met with other staffers and fellow commissioners and AG, also, in "communications" with
           me.

             Hopefully all that's noted before she files her story.

           And pls pass on the Bill McA. What's his email addy?

               Janice- pls look through sched to prove these points. Thanks
