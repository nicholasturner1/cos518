              Joule and Coghill will introduce resoultion to support changing state seal to incorporate
              Native illustration... and they'll work on a task force to accomplish this with Talis
              being our designee to serve on the task force - they asked us to have a positive message
              about their efforts. This is all about respect, recognition, unity. It's all good.
