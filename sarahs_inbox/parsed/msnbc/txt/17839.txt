           Dear Governor Palin:

           I have just read Bill Allen ' s Plea Agreement and the Factual Basis for Plea and I have just re-read your press
           release "Governor Palin Responds to VECO Guilty Pleas ". You have expressed my feelings exactly - "to know
           some Alaskans willingly and knowingly participated and encouraged this corrupt behavior is disgusting ." Thank-
           you for giving voice to Alaskans who are appalled by the recent disclosures.

           As Alaskans, we have some tough times ahead as ramifications from these disclosures become clearer, but I know
           you and your team will be working hard on our behalf. Thank-you.

           CIRI
