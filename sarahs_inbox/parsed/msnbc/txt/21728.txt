              There's nothing new here, and I doubt that anything more will happen.&nb= sp; However, I
              wanted you to be aware of the current situation.

              A quarter of the Senate has = signed on to keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off-

              Backed by a group of 25 senators, Sen. Joe = Lieberman (I-Conn.) introduced a bill today
              that would designate the = coastal plain of the Alaskan reserve as an official wilderness
              area, = thereby precluding any oil and gas activities.

             "America's strength is = not in our oil reserves but in our reserves of innovation,"

             All 26 sponsors are Democrats ,   excluding Lieberman = and Sen .    Bernie Sanders    (I-Vt.).

             The coastal plain is currently = off-limits to drilling rigs, but Lieberman and other
