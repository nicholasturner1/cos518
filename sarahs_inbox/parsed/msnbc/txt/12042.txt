                Governor Sarah,

                Hello! Just a quick note from all of us at ChangePoint . Your sincere delivery of such an inspirational (and fun)
                message was received with roaring cheers from a packed house at our RefresHer event on Friday. Gwen
                Adams, our main speaker for the event , and many others , asked that I let you know we appreciate very much that
                you took the time to encourage and spur on our ladies.

                We routinely pray for you, and we thank God for giving you to us as our Governor. You're a blessing!

                Kelly
