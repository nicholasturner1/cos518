              Governor, is it okay for me to proceed with this request? Elfin Miller has been trying for
              awhile to get in for an introductory meeting with you. You are scheduled to be in Juneau
              March 19 and 20. Thanks. Kari.

              to meet with Governor Palin, to discuss environmental priorities for the
