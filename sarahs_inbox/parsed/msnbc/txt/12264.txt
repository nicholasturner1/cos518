            Frank,

            As the public war-of-words over petro issues gets a bit more personal every week - I'd
            like to remind you all of your strengths. People do not get elected because of vast
            experience or because they posess the most solutions to our problems. They are chosen by
            those vivid qualities of personality, vision, and determination that register in our
            hearts and minds as leadership.



            To use a marine metaphor   through the rough seas of uncertainty - people have not.
            forgotten why they voted for this new leadership - and I believe they remain comfortable
            enough to take a nap while the governor of this ship-of-state is on watch. Please make the
            most of your optimism and confidence.



            Regards

            Mike Heimbuch
