              Governor,

              Bill has come up with a policy for how we will handle these requests , if you concur. His idea is in the e-mail below.

              Rosanne Hughes
              Director of External Communications
              (907) 269-7450

              Subject: RE: POPULATION AND BUDGET

              That is, a policy on questions from citizens , vs. media? No, there isn 't one. Here's what I 'd say: Anything from a
              citizen that can be answered promptly or referred to the proper authority , we'll handle. Anything extravagant
              requested from a non-Alaska resident, requiring labor- intensive research, we must politely decline to provide. If
              it's an Alaska citizen , we'll try to get it eventually , but won't make promises on timing . How's that?

              Yes - we can take care of this individual request . But see the Governor's question at the bottom of the e-mail.
              She wants to know if the press office has set a policy on how to handle random questions like this.

              Don't we have a state demographer? If so, we could refer the question to him /her. If not, we could respond with a
              polite note explaining that we're swamped and have little time for this kind of research.

               I'm going to send this e-mail chain to Bill and ask him what he wants to do.

               Bill - please see e-mail chain below. Thoughts?

              Just a few. Most things are clearly not. for the Governor's office. Inquiries like this, however, are
              fuzzier, and I'm not sure how to categorize them.

              Press inquiries are one thing. Random questions by random people all over the country is another. I don't know
              that we have time to do the latter. How many random questions like this are we receiving?

              I'm concerned about a clearinghouse for these kinds of questions. I imagine Sharon's been dealing
              with numerous inquiries of this kind and should possibly be involved with any response sent by our
              office - but I don't know if we've established a policy on this. Rosanne, what do you think?

              Yes, maybe we can set a time for you to talk to Joe while you are in Anchorage . A phone call can be arranged
              instead of a face to face meeting , you probably do not have time for that. I would like to do a follow up call with
              him as well.
