            I did receive some recommendations from rural legislators as well. I was not familiar with the names and
            with other staffing issues, I did not get a chance to get more information and a better read on the
            individuals. I will have Nizich help pull together resumes for the names we have and we can discuss with
            the cabinet other names that should be on the list.

           Tibs: currently there are a lot of rural "hot" issues, so let's have cabinet suggest names for rural affairs advisor also -
           we can talk about all this at tomorrow's cabinet mtg.

           Sen Dyson had some suggestions also - for that position.

           We should hustle on finding the right person.
