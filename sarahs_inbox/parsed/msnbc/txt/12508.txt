            Sounds good. Do they want to do outside or in?

           Governor -




           Channel 13 is looking for an interview on your NGA trip.  Fox Business News is looking for
           another Exxon Valdez interview - at this point we don't have satellite confirmation so I'm
           not sure that will work. And Steve Quinn wants to know if you can call him after hours to
           talk about the state republican convention and Ben Stevens serving as national
           committeeman.
