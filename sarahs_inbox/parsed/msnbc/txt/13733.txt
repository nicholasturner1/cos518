            This is a great example of how powerful and effective the pressure can be when it's coming
            from outside the administration rather than from inside. Way more effective.

            Subject: Lyda Letter




            I'm sure this was forwarded to you today but just in case, here is the official letter
            from Lyda asking you to include HB364 and HB301 into the SS.



            Joslin is putting together a letter going out from her group challenging Lyda to call her
            own special session if this issue is this important to her. They're working through the
            text of the letter within her board.



            Spoke with Jim Minnery and he's on the fence, but also intrigued with the idea of Lyda
            doing her own. Jeff Turner is courting his support to join her. He says he knows Lyda is
            playing games and messed this up, but would like to see Parental Consent included as he
            believes it has the votes.



            Eddie was hardcore today that Lyda is trying to appease voters by passing this buck to the
            Governor... saying that there are no "do-overs " or "mulligan" on votes.



            I'm putting together some notes I hope will be helpful but won't hit you with those
            tonight.
