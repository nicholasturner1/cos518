                  Subject: Gas Pipeline/DC Strategy
                  In the aftermath of your visits to DC, I think that there is evolving consensus
                  within the Administration about how to deal with Congress. and the Federal
                  agencies on the gas pipeline.

                  When convenient for everyone, I would suggest a conference call to compare
                  notes and to discuss future strategy and its implementation. If you agree, I
                  will take responsibility for scheduling something.
