           Dear governor palin .   I thought you had already set it up as I got an email Friday that it
           is set for 930 Monday .   I think it would be fine for Rhonda to attend . Talis.

           Janice set this up . Do you want Rhonda on the phone during this ? She really wants to be
           plugged in more fully on these rural / native issues.

           Dear Governor Palin,

                 If possible I would like to meet with you for 15 - 20 minutes on Monday to review
           the Kaltag case .  It is a Native "inherent authority" appeal that will be noticed in
           Native circles.   I need to approve or deny an appeal and I want you to understand our plan
           and have an opportunity to approve or stop it as you will be likely asked about it.

                    Just let me know if I can come over anytime Monday.          Talis




                                                               1
