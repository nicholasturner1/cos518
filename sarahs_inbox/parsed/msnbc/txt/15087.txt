                  Subject: Pat Forgey story on Juneau Access

                The Pat Forgey story is out.

                Should I call him this morning and explain that back in 2006 during the campaign there was not a pending motion
                in federal court for a permanent injunction against the project?

                This fact alone justifies an approach of not going out to bid on the project or moving ahead. You could put the bid
                out, pay the contractor to mobilize equipment and for tens of thousands of dollars in other costs, only to have the
                court grant the injunction and stop the project dead in its tracks before a single shovel full of dirt was turned. This
                would be a complete waste of dollars and could strand a contractor and his employees in the middle of the
                building season with no work.

                As usual , Forgey leaves this key fact out of his story. Can we legislate journalistic integrity and competence?
