            J- tomorrow will be a very packed day trying to deal with fall-out from senate action on
            budget- figuring out and trying to straighten out their action and our message will be my
            top priority. Thus, the other scheduled mtgs throughout the day will have to be very
            short, if they HAVE to take place at all, and unless it's lawmakers or staff or media, I
            doubt I'll be able to squeeze in any stop-bys or other mtgs. It will be very important
            that I have time to work with Mike and Karen and Russ all this week on the most important
            priority- budget- and other things will have to be taken care of by LtGov's office and
            others. Thanks
