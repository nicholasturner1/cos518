             Governor - You will take the Caravan from ANC to Fairbanks at approx. 4:00 p.m. (after ANC
             picnic) on Saturday, July 19 so that you can attend dinner w/Congressman Boenher and
             staff.  Dinner is at 6:30 p.m. - Pikes Landing. What staff would you like to accompany
             you in Caravan and at the Dinner -



             On Sunday , July 20 - The Fairbanks Picnic is from 12 : 00 p.m. - 3 : 00 p.m.

             Flight from Fairbanks to Juneau - 5:00 pm - 8 : 32 p.m . All Flights Change planes in
             Anchorage.



             Or take Caravan from Fairbanks to ANC on Sunday, July 20 after picnic and take Monday,
             July 21 flight to JNU - Depart ANC - 8:00 a . m.. Arrive JNU - 9:47 a.m.



             Please let me know what flights you would prefer. We have not discussed return flights
             but the consensus is that you would stay in JNU through Wed., July 23 and then if you want
             to return to ANC for the weekend we would have you return to JNU on either Sunday, July 27
             or Monday, July 28 as the Senate will be voting on Monday, July 28.



             Thanks, Janice
