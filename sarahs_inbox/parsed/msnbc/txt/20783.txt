                The indian with one testicle




                                          The Indian With One Testicle
                               There once was an.Indian who had only one testicle
                               and whose given name was 'Onestone'. He hated that
                                name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.
                                 After years and years of torment, Onestone finally
                                  cracked and said,' If anyone calls me Onestone
                                               again I will kill them!'
                                         The word got around and nobody called
                                                  .him that any more.
                                  Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird

                               forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.' He
                               jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into
                              the forest where he made love to her all day and
                                all night. He made love to her all the next day,
                                   until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.
                              The word got around that Onestone meant what
                              he promised he.would do. Years went by and no
                            one dared call him by his given name until A woman
                          named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being
                          away. Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was
                            overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him
                                   and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
                            Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,
                           then he made love to her all day, made love to her all
                           night, made love to her all the next day, made love to
                           her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

                                          The Indian With One Testicle
                               There once was an Indian who had only one testicle
                               and whose given name was 'Onestone'. He hated that
                               name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.
                                 After years and years of torment, Onestone finally
                                  cracked and said,' If anyone calls me Onestone
                                               again I will kill them!'
                                          The word got around and nobody called
                                                   him that any more.
                                   Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird
                                    forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.' He
                                    jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into
                                   the forest where he made love to her all day and
                                     all night. He made love to her all the next day,
                                         until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.
                                   The word got around that Onestone meant what

                        away. Yellow Bird who was Blue Bird's cousin, was
                          overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him
                                 and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'
                           Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,
                           then he made love.to her all day, made love to her all
                           night, made love to her all the next day, made love to
                           her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!


                                                 Why ???
