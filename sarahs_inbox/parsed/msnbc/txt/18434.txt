              Subject : PFD Announcement

            Governor,

            As we discussed last night, you would like the announcement of the PFD amount this
            year to be made in the bush rather than a big ballroom in Anchorage or Fairbanks.
            Based on our discussion, I got the impression that you would like to be there to make
            the announcement. The announcement should be made September 19, 20, or 21.

            I asked the PFD folks to look at some statistics to see if any bush community stands
            out in any way. So far, I have the following:

            Scammon Bay has the highest percentage of kids applying for PFD's (52.5%).

            If we're just looking for a rural hub to use, and we stick to the AK Air locations, we
            can choose from : Kotzebue , Nome, Barrow, King Salmon , Bethel , and Dillingham.

            Let me know how you want to proceed.

            -Pat
