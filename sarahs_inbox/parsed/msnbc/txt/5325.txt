              Governor:

              Please be aware that the $300 million was not specifically set aside by the

              Legislature for gasline investment.             The Legislature set the money aside as

              a savings account for capital expenditures ... and they don't necessarily take

              it for granted that this money HAS TO be used towards gasline investments.



              My recommendation is that we

              By the way, Steve Quinn did pick up on the fact and he clarified it

              with me right after the press conference. Should be in tomorrow's

              papers...
