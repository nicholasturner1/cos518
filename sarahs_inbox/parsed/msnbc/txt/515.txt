Chuck: Yes - we need this task force. We're in a cabinet mtg right now discussing the topic. Have
Joe Austerman get thinking on this - I just cleared his participation with Commissioner Notti.



Mike Tibbles will be in charge. Let him talk to you about it and some of the other plans we have for
revitalization/changes within Ag. (And MatMaid.). This will be awesome!

Stand by for Tibbles and Kris Perry to contact you with directives.



You have my blessing and THANKS for being concerned and energized and excited about finding
solutions.



I'm ccing Cabinet members be their areas are also affected by the MatMaid issue and just wanted to
let them know we're off and running with the task force idea. Ccing Franci, too, so she'll be a part of
it.

You don't have to respond to this entire list.



Also, intriguing idea(s) from Kaladi Bros guys re: local product they tried to get MatMaid to hear them
on months ago.

Sarah,



Joey and I stayed and talked with Bob Havemeister

after the rally about potential solutions. We'd like

to form a steering committee which would include dairy

farmers, businessmen, and key state people, to come up

with a viable strategy. Bob is all for downsizing and

getting back to basics. Do we have your blessing to

proceed or do you have something else in mind?



Chuck



ps. Lots of happy people because you showed up.
