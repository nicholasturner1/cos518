              done that as I haven't heard back from anyone on this from last week. Thanks

              Good morning Governor.

              When I asked Jesslyn about the letter she said she had checked and the letter had not been received yet
              by the Governor's office. I can follow up with her today to see if the original has come in yet. I did not
              check the copy we had faxed to us from Point Hope to see which address it was sent to.

             I haven't seen the letter nor had real recent update so it shouldn't be a response from me if they are
             seeking accuracies. Your response, below, is accurate and can be attributed to me, but perhaps this is a
             DOL/AG response that's needed.

             I will follow up with Jesslyn first thing this morning and make sure you get a copy . I asked her if it had
             been distributed to everyone and she said yes. A bit frustrating , but I will take care of it as soon as I get
             to the Atwood Building.
