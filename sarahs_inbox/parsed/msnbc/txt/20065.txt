              Governor:

              Through Mike Nizich, you authorized service steps to be implemented January 1,
              2009 for members of-

                 · ASEA-GGU ($1.2 million for Jan.-June)
                   CEA (Confidential Employees Unit) ($15,300 for Jan. - June)

              This will require a supplemental appropriation for FY09.

              We negotiated service steps into the PSEA contract and the Legislature funded that
              for the entire FY09 budget.

              I have recently had meetings with the Union leadership and will address the
              membership in a Statewide teleconference August 6.

             This is the email being sent to all SU members:

             Hello Fellow Supervisor,

             Many ofyou have inquired about the SUreceiving the new Longevity steps that the non-covereds and
             other unions recently received We wanted to update you on our efforts in this regard and to announce a
             statewide teleconference that we have scheduled for NOON on August 6, 2008 (next Wednesday).

             We have had several meetings with Commissioner Kreitzer concerning the longevity steps, as well as
             meeting to review ways we could improve our relationship with this administration. The last meeting
             included the SUEBoard as well as the SUNegotiators. The meetings have been cordial, and
             informative. Commissioner Kreitzer discussed with us her desire to work with us on the Geographic
             Differential Study that was included in their budget, as well as a general salary survey they would like
             to conduct, and changes to the evaluation system that will allow a more streamlined procedure, without
             sapping the supervisor's time. She also expressed an interest in addressing the whole SUso she could
             share with us her vision on where the State should go to address the recruitment and retention problems

             only be scheduling an hour. Please, please remember that she is the Commissioner ofAdministratibn
             and deserves to be treated respectfully, just as we do.

             Since there are a limited number ofsites we can work into the teleconference, we are asking that
             employees desiring to participate in the teleconference reserve a conference room with a Speakerphone

             know and we will send out an email announcing locations . We'll then attempt to provide lunch at each
             site.

             Your SULeadership
