  Commissioner Lloyd has asked again regarding the July 25-28, 2008 - McNeil River Bear Sanctuary -
  McNeil River trip. We had told the Commissioner back in January that the Governor and you were
  interested in this trip. The Commissioner is asking if we can get confirmation to him as he needs to know
  in regards to holding the two permits open. If it will not be feasible at this time the Commissioner would
  like to be able to reassign the two permits shortly. Thank you, Janice
