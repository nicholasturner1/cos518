             I particularly love the timing of this Supreme Crt decision since Fagan suggested
             yesterday that I have a vendetta about the TAPS tariff.  I guess I 'm not the only one - so
             does our entire Supreme Court!

             Here's the decision.  Yippee!!         I guess our collective "obsession" with fixing this
             travesty is paying off...

             The AK Supreme Court issued an opinion today affirming the superior court's affirmation of
             the RCA's decision on intrastate rates for TAPS. This is excellent news. for the State of
             Alaska.  The opinion is attached.
