       Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
       that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time (it's overdue) to move on.



       What process are you, as COS, usin to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
       hands (I spoke with Emil about Privileg yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
       Leo about PriviIPn .. I'll cc t em in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
       the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?




       I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks' service has
       ended. If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
       overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Mater
       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted



       Thanks
