         He does, but the main issue is Child Support Services, which is a part of the Revenue. In
         any case, Anna had already written her a letter which obviously hasn't been received yet.
         Monica is following up.

          Hello,

           I am once again sending this email in an effort to find out what is

          being done to remedy the situation regarding the release of Scott

          Valley's passport upon receipt of a Western Union in the amount of

          $983.00 (approx) when his arrears is around $30,000.00. He had his

          mother send in a few payments of $500.00 and I have received nothing in

          the last few months. I realize he is bombarding CSSD with his complaints

          and I feel the need to try to get to the truth of this matter. The first

          email I sent was 7/20/07 and I have not heard anything back to date.

          Could someone please contact me and let me know what is happening and

          what course of action is being taken? Please?

          Thank you

           Dear Sir or Ma'am,

             When may I expect to hear anything from anybody? I simply want a

         response as to what I can expect the state to do to rectify this

          situation that was created by an employees bad judgment.

          Thank you

         Web mail from : Ms.     Audra Thornton

         address: 601 King Arthur Circle Anchorage AK 99518

          907 375-9410



         MESSAGE:

         Dear Governor Palin,

          I am writting in regard to my child support case, case # 001135510. My

         ex-husband's name is Scott A. Valley and I know that he has written to

        your office and others concerning what he deems as the unfairness of him

        having to pay child support and also the amount of arrears he owes. He

        currently resides in Germany and has for about 10 years.

                                                         4

          The reason I am writting is because I am completely furious over the

         fact that someone at CSSD had the authority to have him sign an

         agreement and released his passport, not only without my knowledge but

         also knowing that once his passport was released he would no longer

         abide by the agreement he signed voluntarily. I had written to the

         former Governor when I found out about this last year and what I had

         told him has come to fruition, Mr. Valley has not paid a dime in months,

         again! What, if anything can be done now? He was able to renew his

         passport and it is now valid for another 10 years. The only thing left

         is his work visa. What can be done now?

          I want to express that my case worker, Mrs. Alene Poynter, has been

         absolutely wonderful, it was somebody above her that made the awful

         decision to release his passport and now I am back to square one in

         trying to get the support he has skipped out on for the last 10 years.

         No one at CSSD has called to give me an update in any way. The last I

         heard from Mr. Valley was that he was using his inheritance money from

         his recently deceased grandfather to obtain an attorney. Of course as

         greeady as he is I am sure he will not hire a lawyer unless he has

         reason to fight me again and since he feels he is free of his obligation

         to my son he probably won't do that either. He knows he doesn't have to

         worry about his passport for another 10 YEARS.

          Please help me. What, if anything, is being done to make this right? I

         cannot believe how easily they released his passport for a mere nine

        hundred dollars when he owes close to $30,000.00. This man should be in

         jail, the only reason he isn't is because he is in Germany.

          Thank you for your time.

        Audra Thornton
