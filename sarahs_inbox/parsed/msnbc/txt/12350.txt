               Dear Mayor Keller:

               It was a pleasure meeting you today . Please consider discussing the following issues at your next meeting with
               Central Region Director Gordon Keith:

                 1. The best location for a Fern Street connection to Knik Goose Bay Road;
                 2. The details and plans for the East Susitna Avenue Extension and Airport Boulevard , Phase I; and
                 3. Whether DOT is the proper entity to receive funds for the Knik-Goose Bay road traffic study.

               I am forwarding your document on Moose-Vehicle Accident Mitigation to DOT's highway safety section.

               The Senate Bill that would establish a grant program for libraries is SB 119 and is sponsored by Senator Olson.
               The bill is presently in the Senate Rules Committee.

               Randy Ruaro
