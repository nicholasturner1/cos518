         Governor ,   thank you for following up on this so quickly.



         I think back to the previous administration where there was a strong position to totally
         eliminate the Division of Agriculture; and even with the significant work ahead of us, I
         remain convinced that the Ag community, comprised of hard working Alaska familes like your
         friend, deserves the support of a properly functioning Ag division.



         The only way we are going to solve the numerous Ag problems is with leadership that
         evaluates both short and long term issues on a business basis, can manage people,
         communicates with all parties, and is capable of helping the Ag community work together
         and plan together.  This must include the Director, the Creamery Board, and the BAC.
         Reorganization / restructuring of the boards must be considered to reestablish
         accountibility and trust.  Your Administration is more than capable of this task.




         Please let me know when you hear from Pnvileg6,               God bless Tom

         Tom: FYI.



         I spoke with my friend, Privileged or Personal , who is married into one of the few remaining
         dairy farming families (f.__, .._-_           _lonists), to get her take on MatMaid and Div of
         Ag issues. It was good to get the personal perspective from her. I don't think the MatMaid
         milk suppliers know what's coming, but they've been very frustrated for some time now.

                                                                   1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0001295

        Also, how is it that the MatMaid execs have received substantial pay increases while the
        business was losing so much money - and the farmers haven't received a penny more for
        their milk despite their tremendous costs rising as they produce the milk for MatMaid?
        Sounds like the woes expressed by commercial fishermen who get paid less and less for
        fish as the canneries make greater and greater profit and fish prices rise in the stores.



        Anyway, pls don't use Privileged or Per name - but pls know we've got a lot of cleaning up to
        do in the Ag arena. Fp-rovilea understands times are changing in Alaska and our take is that
        the business minds working MatMaid evidently may not have changed along with the times.
