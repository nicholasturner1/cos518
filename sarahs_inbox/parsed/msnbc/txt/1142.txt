MESSAGE:

Dear Governor and Mr. Palin;



I'd like to congratulate you on the birth of your son, Tig. My husband and I are greatly impressed with
your integrity and the manner in which you have accepted the challenge of having a

special needs child; no less a gift from God than any other. Your actions speak volumes regarding
your values. May God richly bless and refresh you as you rest and enjoy this new little bundle in
your home and as you lead and govern this state.



Most sincerely,



Norman and Janice Alsup
