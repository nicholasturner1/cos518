            Very par for the course that we can't just get that done. Janice tries to keep up, but it
            takes numerous reminders to note changes and many times it's just never completed on the
            Juneau end - especially weekends and evenings. Thanks

            I'm sure Janice will get back to you, but she is the only person that has access to
            change . I don't, but would like to so that I can help you with this more . Also, I had
            previously asked - per your request - that you have access and I'll have to find out what
            happened with that.

            Janice - instead of me bugging you throughout weekends and evenings to add to                  my
            officially posted schedule, who else has access to amending that calendar and                  can assist?
            I am fine w doing it myself if someone will show me how. We're missing things                  on the sched
            due to my lack of time to note and follow up on changes, due to our continual                  problems
            with emails being received, etc. Thank you
