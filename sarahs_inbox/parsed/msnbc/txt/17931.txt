         Subject:                  AGIA bill signing


         Governor,

         I have received several phone calls wondering if you were planning on an

         AGIA bill signing "event". They are assuming that you intend to make

         this more than the normal bill signing and wanted to convey that if you

         intend to invite potential AGIA applicants, they would appreciate as

         much lead time as possible to build the event into their schedules.

         Please advise if you would like us to assist with planning or

         invitations, whatever.

         Thanks,

         Marty
