           Governor - I have changed the Bill Signing to 1:30 p.m. in Anchorage.

           We can then have the KING AIR available to go by 2:30/3:00 p.m. Thanks,

           Janice

           J- pls sched bill signing for right after dana's event- we'll run to

           that Anchorage eye conference and sign bill, then get on king air for

          Juneau so we don't have to arrive so late that evening in Juneau.

            Todd - what time does Willow wrap up her bball games on Sautrday? We'll

            leave for Juneau right after that       ( stopping in Anchorage for a bill

            signing - something to do with donating eye glasses ). This is after Dana

            Lipse ' s ribbon cutting event for her new shop in Big Lake.
