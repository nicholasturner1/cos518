            Governor,  I don't think you have to do anything but I have asked our Mine/Land/Water
            people to give us a summary of all BLM lands transferred to the state over the last couple
            of years.  I think it is now over 3-million acres.   I will get an update out tomorrow.
            God bless.  Tom

             The Bureau of Land Management has just = published a public land order making 82,608

             The modification of PLO 5150 to recognize the = State ' s previous selections is the

             The BLM is unlikely to make additional lands = within the TAPS Corridor south of the
