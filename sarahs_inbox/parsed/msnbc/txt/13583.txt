                Subject: Cowdery Chronicles - HB281
                Another Ear item but I know its past your deadline. Cowdery was the ONLY vote against Bob
                Lynn's HB281 that passed the Senate 19-1. It had already passed the House 39-0. So out of 59
                possible votes (Foster was out due medical for that vote) ... Cowdery was the only Legislator to
                vote against it.

                Funny, but I can't figure out why he'd be against revealing who gives him cash??
