         Governor, Mark applied for the Board of Game. He hasn't been appointed to a

        board yet.      I'll touch base with him and others today and the rest of the

        week.    And, thanks for the reminder re: plugging your good people in and

         refocusing.

        Ivy: has Mark Fish been appt to anything yet? It's tough trying to remember

        everyone on that very long list of good supporters - those who want to still

                                                                  1

         help - i think this email from Bill to mark is evidence of some of the

          frustration I hear from others, too, who say we've forgotten the good folks

         who got us here and really beleive in the change we want to see in govt, and

         that we're plugging in Murky, Binkley and Knowles' people more often than

         our own. That's the constant from Reeves, et al, also.



         Just got off the fit from Naknek after visiting New Stu and Dlg. Pretty

         draining visits be there were hundreds to talk to at the different community

         events. Nice people tho. Very nice, and "real"!



         Just did the Salmon on Parade and will now do my third funeral in three

         days.




         Very anxious for the team to begin on the budget cuts. Even out there I

         heard cries for SOMEONE to show fiscal restraint in state budgeting. I

         promised I would.



         So, Mike and folks, I'm really counting on a team effort to allow me to

         fulfill the promise to reign in state govt growth and better prioritize

         where the state spends money. The Legislators were totally out of control

         with the capital budget and did exactly what they said they wouldn't do

         (remember their campaign references to the old bumper sticker : we promise we

         won't p*ss it away next time we have a surplus).



         Hopefully OMB and Law are also finding good ways and reasons to cut many of

         the requests.

        As part of the budget cutting exercise, Mike, can I expect direction given

        to cabinet members to find cuts too? I still need to know what targets

        we're trying to hit: are we spending less than last yr? And are we spending

        less than we're taking in? What level of cutting will get me to those goals?

        Thanks!
