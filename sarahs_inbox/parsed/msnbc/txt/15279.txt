              Dear Ivy,


              I respectfully request Governor Palin to consider writing a letter of support for Governor Mike Stepovich's
              nomination for an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since we will be in the middle
              of celebrating our 50th anniversary of statehood next year, it would be wonderful to have Governor Stepovich
              receive this honorary degree during this time period.

              I am attaching my letter of nomination as background.

             The nominating committee will be meeting on May 25th, so time is of the essence here. The letter should be
             sent to:

             HDR Nominating Committee
             University of Alaska Fairbanks
             Office of the Provost

             Fairbanks, Alaska 99775

             (Attn: Sarah Lewis, Academic and Faculty Services Manager)

             Sarah's email is: fnsl@ua£edu

             Thank you very much for your consideration of this request ., and she can be reached at: 474-5178

             Best regards,
