              Newsweek still working on Nightline but not confirmed.
              They are also working with producers at Good Morning America and the Today show.
              But nothing confirmed.

              Newsweek is, however, proposing a west coast conference, similar to the NY conference , at which you
              would speak, as well as Gov. Janet Napolitano (Arizona ) and other speakers.

              You and Napolitano are the two governors featured in special Newsweek issue, which hits stands on Oct.
              8 (the day before the NY conference).

             The staff will have a proposal to us Monday or Tuesday -- and would recognize you at the Oct. 9
             luncheon along with Gov. Napolitano, and announce the west coast event.
             The proposal will have a few dates from which to choose and Newsweek will coordinate with Napolitano's
             office.

              More details for you as soon as I have them.
