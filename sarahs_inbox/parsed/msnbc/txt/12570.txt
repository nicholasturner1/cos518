              Called Gary and Bob to ask where Govs usually park for iditarod start- neither one is
              picking up.

              We're at the iditarod start- we've been kicked out of the two parking spots we thought we
              could park in- did the invitors of this event tell anyone where we're supposed to park for
              this bill signing?
