            I have that lunvh so it needs to be soon- otherwise I'll have nothing definitive to say
            except "we're discussing our options"...

            Once Mike is done with TP's I thought it would be a good time to at least revisit today's
            approach. . .now that we've had a chance to take a breath.

            I don't know if we're going to be ready for an afternoon press availabity. We still don't
           know what we're going to do with the vetoes, I still don't know what all is in the budget,
           we still don't know what battles we'd be wise to pick- how will this all be figured out in
           the next couple of hours? And I have a 1.5 hr lunch with Lisa in between???
