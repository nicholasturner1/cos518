           DEMOCRATS ASK OIL COMPANIES FOR HONEST ADVERTISING

           Gara , Crawford: " Show Alaskans your profit margins"



            ANCHORAGE - Today two Anchorage Democratic Representatives, Les Gara and Harry Crawford,
          called on the oil industry to be truthful in its current advertising campaign aimed at
          preventing fixes to Alaska profits-based oil tax law.




           "Advertising should inform, not mislead the public," Gara said. "It would be nice if the
          oil companies would reveal the truth - that Exxon, Conoco Philips and British Petroleum
          earn higher profit margins in Alaska than almost anywhere else in the world." Gara, along
          with Crawford, cites Conoco Phillips' own 2006 Annual Report.




           Crawford and Gara wrote to ask the major oil companies, and their industry associations
          (The Alaska Oil and Gas Association and The Alliance), to reveal what is shown in Conoco
          Phillips 2006 Annual Report: that Conoco's profit margins are higher in Alaska than they
          are in Africa, Russia, the Middle East, Europe, the Lower 48 and Canada. While profit
          margins in those areas range between 0 percent and 30 percent, Conoco's Alaska profit
          margins hit a staggering 35 percent in 2006.




           In reviewing Conoco's profit report, Crawford noted, "If a 35 percent profit margin
          wasn't enough for Conoco to increase investment, why did they invest in the Middle East
          and Africa, where they report profit margins of just 7 percent? Just how much would Conoco
          want to increase investment in Alaska?"

            Instead of revealing their high Alaska profits , industry association ads have aimed to
           create the impression that the companies aren't making enough money in Alaska, and that
           the flawed PPT oil tax law, adopted last legislative session , doesn't need to be fixed.
           Gara and Crawford, with other Democrats, asked Governor Palin to call a special session
           the day after the federal indictments in the current corruption scandal were issued, and
           Palin announced the special session a week later.




           Exxon and British Petroleum , also co - leaseholders at the highly profitable Prudhoe Bay
          oil field - North America ' s largest - do not report their Alaska profits publicly. Gara
          and Crawford have asked those companies to share that information.




           it is believed most of those profits came from Conoco ' s operations at highly profitable
          fields like Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Alpine. Crawford and Gara have stated that those
          fields should pay a stronger tax than new, less profitable fields, and they are pushing a
          proposal to do that during this coming special session.




           Note: The letter and Conoco's 2006 profit figures are attached for your information.
