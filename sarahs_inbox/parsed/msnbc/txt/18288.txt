          Dear Mr. Olsen:




          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.




          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means , and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

        To Follow-up:

             Thank you for your Veto efforts of so many special interest projects and legislative
        money "grubers" and your sted fast devotion to utilitarianism of Alaska peoples.

        The State foundation comes first, and we need to save for the next "earthquake". I want
        "us" the state people, to be ready for the "Hurricane Katrina."

        I am most impressed with your values, leadership and honesty.

        Thank You
