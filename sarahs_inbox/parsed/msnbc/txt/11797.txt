                  Subject: Cabinet meeting

                I just noticed the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Do you have a specific topic we're going to cover or is it a general
                catch up meeting?

                At this juncture I had planned to be back in Juneau on Wednesday so thought I would attend the Cabinet meeting
                from ANC conference room (unless you want me there in person for something specific). Just let me know.
                Thanks.
