                 Subject: Request to Meet with Governor Palin
                             Dear Ms. Smith:


                             It was a pleasure to meet you at the Governor's Mansion on the afternoon of February 4t',
                             2008. The reception provided to the Alaska Head Start Association will not soon be forgotten.

                             I had the pleasure of talking with Governor Palin during that reception and was encouraged by
                             her commitment to get to know Alaska Head Start programs better.

                             As you are aware, the Governor demonstrated her commitment by allocating $600,000 for
                             Head Start programs to provide services to children on our wait list. We applaud her for
                             making Alaska I-lead Start programs a priority in the budget. Unfortunately, the house sub
                             finance committee did not support the increase.

                             'T'here are many steps the Association is taking toward raising awareness about the importance
                             of Head Start in local communities, the state legislator and the media.

                             On behalf of the Alaska Head Start Association, we would like to request a meeting with
                             Governor Palin to discuss her perspective concerning the elimination of the $600,000
                             allocation. It is our intent to support the Governor in her wish to increase the number of
                             children receiving Head Start services throughout Alaska.

                             Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
