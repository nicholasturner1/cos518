          Thanks for that reminder! In fact, I thot Sharon gave us that neat card and book because
          Kay won the award. I love the "coincidence" in that. Thanks IV, have a great day.

          Governor Palin,




          It just struck me that you have your volunteer awards today. Kaye Love is a recipient
          from Palmer. Sharon just included her book (she writes books for literacy programs) in
          the Easter card she gave you. I just wanted to give you a heads up because you'll see
          them both today.




          Good luck today!
