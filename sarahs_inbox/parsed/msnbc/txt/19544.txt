                 (AGPA) involvement with the recent Backbone III (BBIII) ad, I felt it imperative to set the record
                 straight. Please be assured that AGPA has not been a BBIII participant and was not involved
                 in the formation , approval or financial sponsorship of the ad . AGPA was initially listed in the
                 left-hand column of the ad . However, AGPA Chairman Bert Cottle immediately requested that
                 AGPA's name be removed and you will note that AGPA is not listed in the latest version of the
                 ad. Not one dime of AGPA funding has been used for the BBIII ad.

                 The only ads AGPA has been responsible for are the recent ads regarding its partnering with
                 Mitsubishi Corporation and Sempra LNG. The purpose of these ads is to announce and
                 celebrate these significant developments which have been in the making for a long , long time.
                 AGPA has never stopped laboring to assemble all of the parts and pieces of the LNG project.
                  With diligence, professionalism and nose-to-the-grindstone , we will continue in that vein.

                 I encourage each of you to contact me personally by email or phone (278-7000 office or 223-
                 8530 cell) if you have any questions or concerns regarding this or any other AGPA related
                 matter.

                  and says that he has discussed it personally with President = Bush, who would sign the legislation if it gets
                  to his desk. =

                  I was non-committal pending this communicat= ion to you . There is no question that the Palin

                  The legislation would also require a 50/50 = revenue share between the State and federal governments and
                  would impose a = prohibition on oil exports . With the exception of a = few Alaskans, most people believe
