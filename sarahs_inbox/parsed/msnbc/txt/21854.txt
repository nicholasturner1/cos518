               Just talked to Steve. He said, "I just talked to your 2 favorite women." I said, "gov... and who's my other favorite?"
                I drew a complete blank-he had to give in and tell me who else he talked to.

               Anyway, he went on to say, "Lyda said the governor asked her if she likes white meat or dark meat. Do you
               know where they're getting together for Thanksgiving dinner?" I almost fell out of my chair... and then realized he
               was kidding and said to him, "Yah, they're both coming over to my house." ... he almost fell out of his chair! HA

               Anyway, he was left with the impression (after talking to LG) you guys are old friends and neighbors (like walking
               distance/borrow sugar type of neighbors) and that the media is blowing "the feud" out of proportion.

               First of all, I wouldn' t want to walk from your house to Lyda's-it would take all day. And second of all, if by
               friends Lyda means she liked trying to boss her around when she was mayor, then yes they were friends. I was
               joking of course, but he got a kick out of it...and now knows I'll never believe him again : )
