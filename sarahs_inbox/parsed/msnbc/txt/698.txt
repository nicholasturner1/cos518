  whoever defends last years opl tax deal suspect
  Look at the real background of those defending the corrupted tax deal. What are they
  going to gain personally?How come so many legislators go into public office with little
  to no personal wealth and come out very rich?Not that I am suspicious or anything.

  Were You Here B4 Oil?

  Any of us who've been here for any length of time have watched what's happened since
  big oil came to Alaska. First thing they did was buy all of our politicians so they could
  get a low rate to steal oour oil.And that's what they've been doing for years and always

  You Lm Johnny!

  Why Ralph Samuels would bring back this Murkowski holdover I'll never know. Nice

 Toadie for Frank, this guy is a joke. How much have we paid him now, $3,000,000? It was okay
