              Steve-I confirm receipt of three e-mails from you today to which were attached letters. Just FYI, I have
              oral argument tomorrow before the 9th Circuit in Anchorage.. Once I have that completed, I will be able to
              return my attention to the matters that you have raised in your correspondence.

           And Larval spoke with the hiring mgr John Bennet of DOT who said "they can dig all they
           want there was nothing wrong done. The system was broken and we finally got together with
           Personnel to hire an overly qualified applicant they kept denying.

               Not sure if this fits: You can talk about your three noncompeting goals.
                1 immediate
               2 economic energy from energy coordinator - plans due by end of year. Can affect every location. Wind etc.
               3 AGIA to pay long term bills.

               Am here at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Mega Meeting.

               Senator Stevens made a surprise visit.

               Julie Kitka made a request at this afternoon 's energy roundtable.

                Would like you to add energy relief for health care systems and schools to the special session - or call a special
               session this fall.

               Tara Jollie and I are here.

               Anything you want us to say?

               Thanks.
