                The request was from Michael Dukes, 378-8499, and he wanted to discuss two things with the Governor a. radio
                show, and b. forms for firearms.

                We won't, and I have asked of my commanders in Fairbanks the name and number to this talk show host
                so that I can call to nip this in the bud, otherwise I fear we could each be responding to numerous
                individual complaints. I have already answered two, so I ask that anyone of you so beset with these and
                future similar concerns, please forward them to me for my response.

               My apologies, this may be my fault. About two weeks ago, I had asked how AST dealt with weapon permits and was told
               that commanders did computer checks on applicants and if finding nothing prohibiting the request, these permits were
               signed. This was very different from what APD did in that at APD actually did background checks before the Chief
               approved or disapproved these requests, so I wanted to see the written procedure that AST worked under. I have since read
               that memo and advised that we continue that process, though I may want to examine this with our directors and legal in the
               future. If and when we do, I will alert all before any changes are made.
               Sorry.

               Hi Kari - did you find out what that Fairbanks radio fellow wanted? Mr. Dukes - I believe his name is - and he's got the
               conservative talk show that's quite popular up there.

               You'd mentioned it was something about permits and guns... if it was about additional permits needed for gun owners, then
               I'm against it. But let me know the details of his inquiry when you find out. Maybe one of our media gurus can help him.

                Mr. Dukes knows I'm a life-time member of the NRA and against any more government gun control... wonder what he was
                talking about?
                thanks!
