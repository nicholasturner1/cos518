          Thank you- looks great. If it hasnt already gone out the title can be changed to
          "developmentS" (BP and Conoco's develpments are both subjects in this presser), otherwise
          if it's already out then that's great too. Thanks!

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                    No. 08-118




          Governor Lauds Oil Industry Development




          July 14, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - BP announced today that it had sanctioned the
          development of its Liberty prospect in the federal waters in the Beaufort Sea Outer
          Continental Shelf.  BP will push the envelope of technology by drilling ultra extended
          reach wells, with the largest land rig in the world. This technology will minimize the
          impact of the Liberty development on the environment.




          "I want to congratulate Alaska's oil industry and our Department of Natural Resources for
          these pro-development achievements," Governor Palin said. "Our state has the resources
          and the people to address the nation's energy needs. Alaska remains an attractive and
          inviting place for oil and gas industry investment. I look forward to more good news in
          the future."

          When production begins in 2011, the state will share in the royalties paid by BP to the
          federal government . Under existing law, the state will receive 27 percent of the
          royalties or almost 5 million barrels over the life of the project .  The state and other
          producers on the North Slope will also benefit from potentially lower tariffs on the TAPS
          pipeline.  At its peak in 2014, Liberty will produce 40,000 barrels per day and contribute
          to an increase of 6 percent of total TAPS throughput.




          BP's Liberty announcement comes along after a string of good news in Alaska ' s oil patch.
          ConocoPhillips last week announced " first oil " from its Qannik prospect in the Colville
          River Unit . Qannik production will peak in 2009 at 4,000 barrels per day. With potential
          expansion the prospect may yield over 25 million barrels. On June 13 , 2008 , Pioneer began
          production from its Oooguruk field. Oooguruk is a 90 million barrel oil field that will
          reach peak production of 20,000 barrels per day in 2010. Pioneer is one of the new
          independents now working in Alaska and is the only independent operator on the North
          Slope.  Soon to follow Pioneer as operator of a new producing oil field is the major
          Italian oil company ENI which sanctioned the neighboring Nikiatchuq oil field in January
          2008 . Development of this oil field is now underway.
