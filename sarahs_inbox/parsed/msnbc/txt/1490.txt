I will check with OMB.



I will also be in Anchorage tomorrow to meet with Commissioner Kopp and

review issues . I think we can start making progress pretty quickly.



It's down the road a bit, but eventually I would like to talk with Chuck

about setting up an independent internal affairs investigator. (Not an

ombudsman).
