                 Dear Governor Palin,

                   I'm writing today to respectfully ask you to support the Fire Island Wind Farm project,
                 currently in the FY09 capital budget. As regular Alaskans are affected by skyrocketing energy
                 prices, it's important to look towards cheap renewable power. This project is worth the initial
                 investment; the price of wind power will stay constant,.while the price of oil and gas will
                 continue to fluctuate and climb for years to come.

                  I've heard you speak quite eloquently on moving our state forward by investing in renewable
                 resources. I urge you to put action behind your words and fund this worthy project. It passed the
                 Legislature with bipartisan support, and deserves to move forward.

                 Thank you for your consideration,

                 Kate Herring
