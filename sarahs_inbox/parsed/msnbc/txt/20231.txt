                Subject F1N: PR 08-2598 Summer 2009 Schedule Released

              Governor:
              After the problem last January with getting the draft schedule for summer , 2008, AMHS has not gotten two schedules In a row out earlier than ever
              before. The fall - winter 2008 schedule was sent out months earlier this year than usual . Now we have the draft summer 2008 schedule out for
              public comment earlier than from what we can tell , has ever been done before by AMHS . Getting our schedules out early should help bookings which
              continue to build with the new routes and vessels we put in place.

              AMHS has an op-ed drafted for Jim Beadle to run next week that will talk about all the progress we have made and I believe Rosanne and the PIO,
              Roger Wetherell have been working on a d irect mail piece. (Unfortunately, Pat Forgey at the Empire continues to refuse to write anything positive
              about our work with AMHS . Rosanne and I met with the editor about Rand basically were told that news about negative events sells more papers)
