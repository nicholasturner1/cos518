          Subject:                  Bridge


          So ironic - I told Leo , Tibbles , etc just yesterday that we MUST come out with a strong
          position against AK ' s perceived " Bridge to Nowhere" so we quit looking clueless and
          selfish across the nation and can clear up the perception that the Gravina project is the
          state ' s priority . The $350m bridge is not our priority.



          The nation needs to be spending $ on fixing what we have - Minnesota needs " bridge money"
          today more than we need a few Alaskans to perpetuate the nonsensicle notion that our
          Gravina earmark is more important than fixing aged infrastructure.



          We would gain so much if we get that message out there - that the nation can pull, and
          work , together and make wise decisions on federal priorities ... we should see that earmark
          redirected to Minnesota ' s tragedy be the Gravina bridge isn ' t going to happen on our watch
          anyway.
