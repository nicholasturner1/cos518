            MESSAGE:

            Gov. Palin,




            Your name and a photo along with a quote regarding renewable energy was on a flier for the
            Chugach elections for Wiggin, Reiser, and Izzo. My husband and I are Chugach members and
            are wondering if you were aware of this ad and if you are endorsing this slate.



            Thank you for your timely response,



            Carrie Smoldon

            mom to Isaac and Josh,

            wife to Todd,

            child of God
