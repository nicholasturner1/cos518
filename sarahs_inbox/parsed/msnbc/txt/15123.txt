              Thank you Talis - and have the best day ever as you breath a sigh of relief after walking
              across the stage, Dr. AG!

             Dear governor palin.  I just spoke with mr svobodny. He has just confirmed with the clerk
             at home that there is no extradition request from Colorado for you to approve at this
             time.  You are not delaying anything because nothing has arrived for you to approve.
             Talis.

              Press has reported they're waiting on me to extradite. We'll need to correct that if
             press believes we're sitting on it. Thanks
