             Subject:                 Habitat


             Mindy- lawmakers are ushering through their Habitat move legislation. We'll need to notify
             them of our action towards moving Habitat back to Fish and Game. We'll be announcing that
             to Alaskans tomorrow, so legislators will need notification right before our 12:30
             announcement. Sharon and Cora may help with messaging it to them, through you. Thanks
