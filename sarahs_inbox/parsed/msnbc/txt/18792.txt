          Coulda sworn he said he was coming in last night be we need that travel cushion to make
          sure Juneau travelers make it to these important appts.



          Well, someone better call bs on Lyda- either she or we are lying about
          notification/invitation for ACES review.

          Lyda is on the air essentially that she didn ' t have contact from the

          Gov's office until yesterday AFTERNOON.



          Obviously I didn't catch Mike ' s comment that Charlie & Lyda were

          previous contacted and you two did....



          but what she ' s saying on the air right now is quite different than that.
