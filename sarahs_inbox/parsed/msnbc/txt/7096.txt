         Sounds like there are a lot of cons to this idea - so what are the pros?

        Subject: Clean Elections Act initiative application



        Greetings, Gang.




        Later this week or sometime next week, Tim June of Haines plans to stop by the Division of
        Elections office in Anchorage to present an application for an initiative to implement a
        Clean Elections Act, a proposal to give political candidates for state office the option
        of accepting public financing in lieu of private fundraising.




        This is the same as legislation introduced this month by Sen. Bill Wielechowski, SB 182,
        and Rep. Gabrielle LeDoux, HB 261. To see SB 182 and sponsor statement, go to
        http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill. asp?session =25&bill=SB182.




                                                               1




                                                                                                         PRA_GSP01_0001971

         Mr. June asks that the Department of Law not delay in its review of the application so
         that he and supporters may start gathering signatures this summer.




         His proposal may get some publicity.




         It's already been the subject of APRN's Talk of Alaska today [Tuesday] and last week, and
         it may come up again when the Governor is on the show next week.
