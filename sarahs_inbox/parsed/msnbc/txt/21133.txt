          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,rnrnCan you explain to me how you can support this so called hunt in Katmai
          National Park? It is appalling to me that you as a lifelong Alaskan can look at these
          images and be able to sleep at night. This isn't hunting; it's a lazy way of hunting. It
          is unfortunate that when people get into power they can be so easily corrupted and
          separated from the normal people of this state .  I'm sure you will never see this email
          due to the political filters in place, but if you do, you should be ashamed of
          yourself.rnrnSincerely,rnrnJoseph SlaglernPalmer,
          Alaska(http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/wildlife/story/9359737p-9270866c.html)
