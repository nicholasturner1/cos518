              It was last year's capital. It passed through last because it was the only thing Wasilla
             got and they used matching funds to secure it - but some lawmakers still are using that
             and Stoltze's (bond approved through Anchorage Parks and Rec) astro-turfed Chugiak field
             as my "hypocritical" projects.

               Kris - pls call Mayor Keller and ask her again for her last year ' s justification for
             asking for the town's top priority : emergency kitchen in the Complex to meet FEMA match
             (or however it was justified through the legislature ).     She and district lawmakers need. to
             justify that as it was her #1 request ... I'm getting heat for that one still and she/Lyda,
             Vic didn ' t really have to explain it when I didn ' t veto it lat yr. It wasn ' t vetoed thanks
             to regional balance needs in the budget process , the local and federal match helped too.
