           I have a brief memo at the office for you.



            The president/CEO is one of the attendees.



            The Company was founded by former Union Texas Petroleum and ARCO employees that are
           familiar with Cook Inlet and Western North Slope (Alpine).



            They have an. Anchorage office and are gearing up. They do not have an ask. This is a
           courtesy visit as much as anything. A welcoming message from you would be helpful.
