               Pls get for me in writing what is my family's "home base" so I know if I can travel with Piper, et
               al, either TO or FROM Juneau now (still don't know why it's evidently been changed that I have
               to find "First Family Events" for their participation while IN Juneau now, instead of outside of
               Juneau. That rule changed on me without notification and without any reason given.) Just want
               to make sure I'm doing everything right, so pls let me know what the exact new rule is.
               I'll know further about any Juneau 4th of July trip once I know where I can traveL Thanks

               Governor, I understand your concerns. If it will help, Rep Edgmon requested this bill signing in his district and I am
               sure he would put it in writing if that would help.

               Just a thought; otherwise I will let him know it won't work this year.

               Kel- Talked to Todd about the trip to Dlg for Bryce's bill signing- he agrees that the perception would be that this is
               way too self-serving and "coincidental" that it would happen to fall during the peak of the comm fish season- so
               please scratch that idea of traveling to Dig for it. If Bryce is around Anchorage would he just want it signed locally?

               Governor,

               I apologize for the late hour. Here is the letter for Mary Glazier that I promised to re-send your way for approval. It
               should show up as an attachment, as well as in the body of the email. Once it has your approval, IT format it and
               have it ready for Mary and her flight to Japan tomorrow.

               Please let me know ifyou have any questions. Thank you,

               Kate
