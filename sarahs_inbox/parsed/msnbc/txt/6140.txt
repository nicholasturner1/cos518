        Governor Palin,



        Yes, but it wasn't the purpose of my trip. I took personal leave on Thursday and Friday to
        go home.



        Rep Olson invited me to Kenai to tour the community on Thursday. I knew the Classic was
        going on so I made sure I took personal leave even as I was networking with the Community.
        Nizich made sure I put personal leave in also. I'm sorry I assumed and didn't verify with
        you or Mike Tibbles.



        Rep Olson and I visited with Chuck Kopp at the Police Department, toured the Job Center,
        saw the North road and Agrium, and the gas to liquid facilities.



       Kurt asked if I would volunteer with the Kenai Chamber of Commerce (all community
       volunteers) to serve breakfast to Kenai Classic participants. I said I would. Thursday
       evening I was asked by several people if I were going to fish, and I said "no." Friday
       morning, after serving breakfast from 4-6 am there ended up being room on the boats for
       the volunteers. I did get on a boat until noon. My name was written in as the last chamber
       volunteer on the last boat. The majority of my time in Kenai was spent reaching out to the
       Kenai community, not hanging out with the Classic crowd. Kurt will verify. I thought it
       would be a great networking opportunity.



       The majority of my trip was spent in Palmer with my family. Nobody expressed to me
       concern with traveling to Kenai. Had I known there was concern you know I would have
       rescheduled for a different weekend. I used personal air miles, used my own vehicle and
       stayed with my family 3 nights, Kurt for 1 night.



       Governor, you know I would never do anything, intentionally or inadvertently, to
       disappoint or upset you. I know you know I work hard for you 7 days a week and that I
       take my job very seriously.  If you are upset, which I'm sensing from your email, I
       sincerely apologize from the bottom of my heart.
