               Governor,

               I've attached updated talking points from the departments on Kenai River regs. They are too
               extensive for yours or my general use but they provide a lot of good meat for Sharon and
               others should people ask. I believe Tom is taking the lead on press, but thought you'd want to
               be armed.

               I think the message is fairly simple : The regs protect the environmental quality of a valuable
               resource and we wanted more public comment on the outright ban of 2 strokes to determine
               whether we were over-regulating or creating an unreasonable burden on the moms and pops
               (who would have to go buy another engine).
