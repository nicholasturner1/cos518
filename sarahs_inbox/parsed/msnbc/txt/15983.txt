           They don't have anything substantive to criticize you over, the

           Anchorage Daily News loves AGIA and TransCanada and doesn't mind the

           $500 million, and they just can't stand it. So they're taking cheap

           shots at you. It's a lot of bitter weeping gnashing of teeth over that

           86 percent approval rating. It's also sour grapes.

         Crazy that it is the same of names blabbing about "foto-op Palin,

         exploiting her kids... Blah Blah Blah".

          We're taking care of monitoring those for you, Governor. It's the snotty

          comments of all five people in town who have nothing better to do than

          snipe at you.

          Ok- I had to finally read a blog (yuck!) be of comments I heard about

          wesley's account of the bear sighting in Juneau the other day.

          Sheeesh- nothing's changed since I stopped reading that ADN blog nearly

          two months ago!

          But Wesley does need to clarify that, NO, I was not looking for

          publicity- I did not approach him about seeing three bears by the

          mansion... he approached me about it after hearing that I was one of the

          crowd looking at the bears that morning and he asked me to comment!

          Could he at least clarify that on the blog (without me having to admit

          to him that I actually spent the time reading his blog entry and the

          bloggers' replies). And I didn't put my kids in any danger, as the idiot

          blog comments claim.

          Now, remind me to not peek in again at that ridiculous media forum -

          it's the most unhealthy and idiotic forum imaginable. Hopefully others

          can do that for us and call people on the untruths and misperceptions

          they read there.
