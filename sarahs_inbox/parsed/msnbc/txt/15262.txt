           Dear Governor Palin:

          Congratulations on the birth of your 5th child. I thought you would enjoy this positive
          definition of Down Syndrome . I get it out and read frequently . I also have a child with
          Down Syndrome . She is 26 years old and holds down 2 jobs. She is a wonderful person.

            Here is a positive definition:
