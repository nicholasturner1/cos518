Hey Erika,



I'm not sure were the lines of communications got

cross threaded but I never committed to attending the

Red Cross event in Fairbanks.We will be in Glennallen

that weekend for events.) spoke with Joe Mathis with

the Red Cross last week about getting together in

Anchorage for a meeting this week.



I'll give you a call tomorrow to discuss my upcoming

obligations and commitments.



Thanks Todd
