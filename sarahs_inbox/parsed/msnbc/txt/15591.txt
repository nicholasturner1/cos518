           Governor,



          You've been so swamped these last few days, I didn't have a chance to confirm with you
          whether you'll be attending the AK Airlines event tomorrow at the AK Aviation Heritage
          Museum, 11 a.m. In the case that you do attend, I have compiled information and remarks
          for you.  They are in a briefing binder on your office chair, and I have attached the most
          pertinent info to this email. Please let me know if you have any questions or requests.



          Thank you!
