           Subject:                Saturday


           Hi R- the events this Saturday at the Gov's House, as hosted by the First Family, are
           historic. We do not believe they've ever been done before as Todd gathers former First
           Ladies for their tea... plus we invited former First Ladies and their (grown) children to
           revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.

              Alaskans would like to know of this, I'm sure, so profiling it and/or allowing a photo
           op of these wonderful elderly Alaskan women as they gather here on Saturday would be great
           for historical reasons and for today's public to witness.

             Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on
          it, as can historians in Juneau who can appreciate this unprecedented event... and please
          remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for the current First Family to host this.
          We'll all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with his Styker
          Brigade before their Sept deployment to Iraq.

             An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his
          blue collar Slope job to host the First Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of
          announcements ). Thanks!

             (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pls let Rosanne know
           so it can be cranked out today, then press can follow up.)

          Sharon- remember that I do desire to speak with reporters instead of seeing (like this
          morning) that I was "unavailable for comment". I was on the flight for only 1.5 hrs so
          people know I could have spoken to Wesley before or after the fit, had I known he had
          called, thus the false assumption will be that I again avoided press. Pls let me know when
          reporters call on this so I can respond thanks.
     i
    1        Also, there can't be any suggestion that I hesitate re: their investigation. The
          critics would love to believe I don't want want one so they can continue to untruthfully
          claim that I'm hiding something.

          S- does ktuu know that the wooten divorce was quite awhile ago... despite their insistence
          everytime they report on this that "she fired monegan while the trooper was going through
          a divorce with her sister"? Sheeesh, they haven't gotten it right yet. And even their
          forgetfulness that we offered WM another job to better utilize his strengths... it's just
          so frustrating that they're playing right into lyda and hollis' hands., and vice versa.

             I prefer speaking to these reporters who want comments on the issue. I invite the
          investigation but it's obvious we could get to the bottom of it all if leggies and
          reporters would just ASK me further questions instead of spending $100g on a fishing
          expedition.

              someone) and this can all be put together if, not today then tomorrow. Sharon is slammed so I won't be
              asking her to do this one... pls let me know if you have other ideas on who can help craft this, including
              getting a quote or two from participants like the former House Manager and/or other First Ladies like
              Bella Hammond (whomever is easy to reach). Kate can assist on this- she's a great writer and
