          I just called Russ and he said to ask Karen your question below -- that

          she handles that. I will follow up with Karen.



          NOTE: FYI, he told me that all of them - Russ, Karen, Mike T. -- were

          perplexed with your questioning of them late Friday night via email. He

          said there are things we have no control over -- like when we get the

          budget. They can give it to us at the same time as the special session

          and we can't do anything about it.

          was refused by which lawmakers, etc. We need backup paper trail for all

          that be we know lyda and harris will claim we didn't "communicate" any

          of this to them.
