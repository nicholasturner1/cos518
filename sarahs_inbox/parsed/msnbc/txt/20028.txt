         .I'm with Kris on this. Sheila Balastrairi (sp) said this morning that the Governor has NOT
          endorsed a candidate for senate.

          Even that said, not a big deal unless I'm missing something. It isn't specific to one
          candidate. Just my opinion, but I don't think additional follow-up is necessary.

          I hear ya. Here's Megan's exact quote from last night:



          "On July 2nd Palin and Stevens appeared at a press conference about energy. Back them she
          said endorsement of a Senate candidate would come at a later date."



          I'll see if I can track down the July 2nd stuff.

          I was there as was Sharon and Nizich. I recall the "now is not the time or place." And no
          specific mention that an endorsement would be forthcoming.

         Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment . I'll ask Sharon to check on
         what Balding think she heard - pls give Sharon details so she can check. I said weeks ago
         "this isn't the time " in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate . Those who were with me at
         the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

         don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
         from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
         don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
         shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.

                    All,

                    Kyle Hopkins filmed a little over 4 minutes of the Gov' s press conference with Stevens three weeks ago. Here is
                    the link: http://community.adn.com/adn/blog/24417?pace=5

                    Here is the transcript of the opening comments:

                    KB: Governor, your appearance here was kind of a surprise today.   Can you tell me
                    about how that came about and whether we should see that as kind of an endorsement
                    for Sen. Stevens for re-election?

                    Gov: Well, it's um... I'm on the clock and we're in a Federal Building, so we won't
                    talk about campaigns or endorsements, all that comes later , but I support the
                    Senator's proposals here and his passion to again allow Alaska to be heard and to
                    lead with an American energy policy that has been - I believe - sorely lacking.
                    And it is time to step up, work together, others are looking to us, to see how we
                    are going to work together through this energy crisis and from here, forward, so
                    I'm honored to get to be here and certainly an entire team working with us, we are
                    going to be.able to create the best solutions all working together. So, I'm
                    honored to get to be here with him.

                    Sen: No, no, no announcements will be made here about - political announcements
                    won't be made in this room.

                    Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

                    Kate
