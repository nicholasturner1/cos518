          MESSAGE:

          Congrats to the Palin family on the birth of Trig ; what a beautiful baby . Thank you
          Governor for being a true leader in the life movement ... we need more leaders like you,
          that have a moral conscience and use it for guidance in their public office, rather than
          their own self - interest . God bless you and your family.
