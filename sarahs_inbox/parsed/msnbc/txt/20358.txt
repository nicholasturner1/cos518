           MESSAGE:

           With respect for the Governor, I wish to forward a copy of a letter I sent to the Alaska
           advantage program as I feel I am being taken for a ride here. A ride I choose not to take.
           As a current registered Republican voter I am hoping she at least gets a copy of this
           information. Thank you for your time.




          Without Prejudice,



           Clipper Ordiway

           Let me see if I get this correct...




           I apply for a student loan of $2750 . 00. (I was sure it was only $2450 . 00) I get it for one
           semester . After that you dumped me'like a hot potato because I owed child support . During
           my time of dealing with child support of which I now no longer owe, you take it upon
           yourself to refinance a loan into another loan I NEVER authorized . Now you expect me to
           pay almost %300 interest ? ($ 6,778 as of 7-16-08 statement ). I had no problem paying my
           original debt and you were in fact the next on my list. I understand the only reason for
           student loans is profit for Alaska, Inc.. Like mining the miners in the old days . You have
           already started taking ( loose word ) money from my paycheck . I have, no problem with this,
           but what I insist on is that you drop the interest and let me pay as I am now until I get
           this out of my hair forever . I can already see that I may loose my permanent fund (that I
           have never had the pleasure of receiving due to child support ) and more than likely any
           energy assistance tha t may come with it due to some loophole somewhere . Money needed to
           fill my oil tank to keep my family warm.




           With respect for Governor Palin , a copy of this email has been sent to her via her web
           site . The next copy will go to the News Minor as I plan to scream from the roof tops
           hoping to inform the next generation that if they can not afford to pay as you go when
           attending collage, don't go.




           If the Alaska Advantage program is nothing more than a collection agency with a fancy
           name, I hereby consider this email a cease and desist notice.




          Clipper Ordiway
