           Governor - I was waiting for the dust to settle a bit before offering my congratulations -
           but I can see that's not going to happen anytime soon. Just wanted to tell you, we are
           very proud of you and I hope you're getting a chance to " squeeze" a run in every now and
           then! You've put together a great Cabinet and we continue to serve the people of Alaska
           guided by your leadership and vision. Hang in there and take care, Bill
