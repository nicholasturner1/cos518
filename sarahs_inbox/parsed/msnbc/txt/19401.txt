               I will defer to the Governor on this and her desire to attend but the 19th is going to be difficult as the
               Governor will be in Anchorage that day for an event.

               I have made contact with the office of the House Minority Leader . The bottom line is that the Governor
               is Invited to have dinner with Mr. Boehner and his entourage Saturday (July 19th) or Sunday in
               Fairbanks.

               The staff recommends Saturday, because the House members will not be as tired , and the Governor
               could also offer some welcoming remarks. Sunday is less preferable for several reasons.

               I also asked whether the Governor could actually accompany the entourage to the North Slope. The
               staff is checking with Mr. Boehner and will get back to me as soon as they can.

               Please advise whether either July 19th or 20th is a possibility . I will let you know as soon as I hear
               about the North Slope portion of the trip.

               P.S.
               I understand that the Governor will meet with the Republican Challengers group on July 17th. So, there
               should be no conflict with Mr. Boehner's trip.
