             I think they are the same ones raised by Halcro: his claim that the bridge shipper (feds)
             and federal loan guarantee suggested changes are TC's conditions.

            Kris, You should be receiving some gasline memos shortly fr a friend. Please handcarry to
            Joe Balash. Let him know they were given to us and I didn't know whether our gasline team
            has seen them. They have to do with Legis Council consultants talking about TC's proposal
            supposedly being contingent on a few items.
                                                                  1
