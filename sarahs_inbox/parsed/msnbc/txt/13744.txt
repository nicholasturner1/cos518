              Dear Governor Palin,

                  First, Wow. Congratulations on your new son.

              CONFIDENTIAL DELIBERATIVE PROCESS PRIVILEGE

              Folks, this is a heads-up that the Alaska Public Offices Comm'n determined at its December
              meeting to refer lobbyist Ashley Reed to the Department of Law for consideration of criminal
              prosecution under AS 24.45.151(a) because of his 20 year history of late filing of lobbying
              reports. He has paid 30,000 in fines over the years and apparently is undeterred by civil
              penalties. The report and recommendation is being sent to Attorney General Colberg with
              copies to Rick and to me. I have seen a draft of the referral request and expect that it will be
              sent either this week or early next week. The purpose of this note is to give you a little
              background so you know that the request is coming and that I have some history with it.
