    ETS Employees ae'



    By now you are aware there was a helicopter crash that involved State employees yesterday.



    It is with great sorrow that we report the passing of three ETS employees and an ERA helicopter pilot who
    were killed in the helicopter crash last night near the 120 milepost on the Glenn Highway. Tom
    Middleton, 46, Joe OdETMDonnell, 48, and Mike Seward, 38, and the pilot of the ERA helicopter perished
    in the crash. Quinn Seward, 14, son of Mike Seward, is the sole survivor of the crash. He was transported
    to Mat Su Regional Hospital and his status is unknown at this time.



    This is a tragic loss and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families and friends of these men. Please
    join me in keeping Quinn Seward and all family members in your thoughts and prayers.




    Grief counseling will be available and we will be planning a memorial service in the near future. We will
    send updated information as we have it.



    Annette Kreitzer

    Commissioner
