              "I am sincerely grateful to all the members of the House of

             Representatives for their efforts over the past 25 days .        They have

             worked diligently in pursuing the people ' s business .      All Alaskans can

             be proud of the bill the House has passed."



              "I am particularly happy that the 25 percent rate was included. We

             worked closely with legislators from both sides of the aisle to make

             sure that Alaska remains an attractive place to invest in oil and gas

             development .    At the same time , they have moved to ensure that Alaskans

             receive an equitable share of these non-renewable resources."



             "If this bill is enacted , we will all take a positive step forward in

             Alaska's future.     I look forward to working with members of the Senate

             to preserve the good work done by the House tonight."
