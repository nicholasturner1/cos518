             Governor Palin,



             That national political scene may be a tempting plum, but we need you here at home. Your
             the best thing to hit the Juneau scene in many a year, but your job is not done.



            Besides , First Dude would have a hard time running the Iron Dog around the Beltway....



            Stay here... your an Alaskan appreciated by Alaskans.



            Thanks,

            Marty Hall
