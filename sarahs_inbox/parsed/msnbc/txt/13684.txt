           Thanks Karen. Truly, they'll need to dig in hard and find places to reduce. I appreciate
           you conveying that.

           Subject: Budget Status/wrap UP




           Commissioners - With the legislative session over , I am writing to thank you for ALL your
           hard work and assistance on budget and legislation.- That being said, there is a lot of
           work in front of us in terms of budget review, bill analysis, and preparation for the June
           special session.  The Chief of Staff will be contacting each of you individually over the
           next few days and will be scheduling a cabinet meeting later on this month.



           I am attaching a one-page summary of the FY08 and FY09 budgets that passed compared to the
           Governor's proposed level of spending. It is important to look at both fiscal years as
           there is a lot happening in FY08 capital. Governor Palin has asked me to convey her
           concern with'the overall size of the operating and capital budgets . She is asking that in
           addition to your review of capital budget items including our requests and legislative
           additions, you also look closely at your operating budgets for items/areas that can be
           reduced.



           The Governor has been clear in her commitment to slow the growth of government. In
           preparation for the FY2010 budget, the Governor would like you to begin identifying
           programs or services that we can reduce or eliminate and what statutory or regulatory
           changes might be needed to accomplish that.   So, it will be important to begin a review
           of programs and services as soon as possible if we are going to be able to propose these
           changes in the FY2010 budget.



           Thank you again and I look forward to seeing all of you at the next cabinet meeting.                      KJR
                                                        1
