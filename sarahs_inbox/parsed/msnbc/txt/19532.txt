           I ask for that flagging because Pat Daugherty said that's the only way to know what's
           bogus on their blog- and I don't blog nor have access to flagging anyway on these devices.

           Can someone flag the lie in the blog "sexy highway talk among governors" that claims Trig
           was in the fender bender with me- and he wasn't in a car seat on my commute. Sheeeesh.

              I WISH ADN would follow up on that one (as the blogger asks ADN to do) so that I can
           put that rumor to rest... Rumor is Walt reported me so I fired him. What an idiot blog
           entry, very easy to counter with the truth when half a dozen APD cops responded and
           witnessed no Trig in vehicle.
