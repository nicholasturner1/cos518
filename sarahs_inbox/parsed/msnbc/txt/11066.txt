              Subject :                Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 11th, 2008


              Dear All,



              Nikolski placed a fuel order in July and has yet to receive the

              delivery. The lack of fuel has stopped community projects, threatened

              property and the health of community members, and created an economic

              emergency due to the use of dedicated monies to charter in small amounts

              of very expensive fuel. To date, the Nikolski IRA has               incurred over

              $ 48,000 of expenses in drums of fuel and a total of 8 air and marine

              charters. As of the last update, the barge was circling near Nikolski,

             awaiting a weather break.



             We are sorry to report that the situation in Nikolski has only worsened.

             The barge left Nikolski without delivering fuel on Tuesday night,

             reportedly due to weather.        The barge will service Cold Bay and

             Perryville before returning to fuel Nikolski. The earliest possible

             delivery would be January 18th but likely later due to forecasted

             weather. An additional problem are the undelivered heavy equipment

             repair parts that were on the barge, leaving air service unsecured as

             the runway cannot be properly cleared.



             The community will need more fuel before the new delivery date estimate,

             as a number of homes are out of heating oil and the power plant is using

             more fuel than recently as homes are being heated with electric heaters.




                                                                                                                 PRA GSP01 0009824
