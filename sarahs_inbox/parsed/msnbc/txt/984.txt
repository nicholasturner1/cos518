Subject :                 FW: Cell phone reimbursement


Here's the latest with personal cell phone reimbursement. In sum, it's as I thought--questions of
confidentiality are still unanswered by Law. Kim Garnero (Finance director) thinks that personal
emails on a personal device would be confidential and not subject to subpoena, however the
question is still unanswered by Law.



I'm just getting to the office and will follow up with Kim on a timeframe of when we'll hear back with a
legal opinion. I'll also ask if personal emails have always been routed through the state server.

I believe that's true, although I don't know for sure. Eric, have you signed any for Admin?

Are state employees currently signing up for reimbursement without the opinion from law?

I'm hesitant to go too far on the confidentiality questions until we hear from Law. I would think
personal emails on a personal device are confidential, but I'm not an attorney. I will send this
question to Law to make sure that they address the confidentiality question in their response to us on
the ethics boundaries.

Well that's understandable that state business could be subpoenaed off a personal device, but
personal emails on a personal device are confidential ? What type of situation would constitute
subpoena of personal emails? I'm really just trying to weigh the benefits of a personal vs state device.

We are also waiting on Dept. of Law for confidentiality issues, but I can tell you that using a personal
device results in much less probability of audit or ding by the state. It's a strong motivator to move to
the personal device with allowance status.



That said, if you have state business on a personal device, it is possible that information could be
subpeona'd or accessed through other "public access to information" avenues. This would be
specific to a topic, not just the work of an individual.



Does this answer the question?

Kim

Thanks, Kim. I have your original email. My question is if we have a personal blackberry that we route
our state email to, and also receive reimbursement from the state each month, and sign the
reimbursement contract w the state, can our phone and email records be audited or can we as state
employees be dinged in any way for having our personal and state emails route to the same device. I
would gladly buy my own blackberry if it and its contents were truely mine. Any thoughts here?

Hi Ivy,

The monthly allowance amounts for personal devices are now available. I sent out an email with the
form and FAQs on March 7th. I'll forward to you.



Allowance is $40 per month for cell and $75 for Blackberry.



Not waiting for Law on this one. All we need is a form signed by supervisor and employee that the
device is needed and that employee has opted to provide.



Waiting for Law to opine on the ethics issues regarding personal use of business assets.



After you see the next email, let me know if you have any other questions.

                                                                                   ROSTON 01718

Kim,

Can you answer my questions below re: cell phone reimbursement? I should have probably asked
you first.



Thanks,

Commissioner,

Are the reimbursements available yet for personal cell phones? How much is the monthly
reimbursement? Also, have we gotten an opinion from law on the reimbursement contract state
employees must turn in to receive the reimbursement?
