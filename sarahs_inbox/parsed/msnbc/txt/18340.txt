         MESSAGE:

         After cutting spending in all sorts of other areas I find it appalling that you would
         appropriate $400,000.00 to tell me and all other Alaskan's that we are stupid and don't
         understand what shooting wolves and other wildlife from the air means. It doesn't matter
         how you sugar coat it its still the same. How many times do Alaska voters have to tell
         government and fish and games officials that the majority of us do not approve of Aerial
         Predator Control.  If moose numbers are so low in various management areas maybe the human
         predators should stop hunting those areas for several years to let the numbers recover.
