           Even that said, not a big deal unless I'm missing something. It isn't specific to one
           candidate. Just my opinion, but I don't think additional follow-up is necessary.

           I hear ya.     Here's Megan's exact quote from last night:



           "On July 2nd Palin and Stevens appeared at a press conference about energy .                 Back them she
           said endorsement of a Senate candidate would come at a later date."



           I'll see if I can track down the July 2nd stuff.

            I was there as was Sharon and Nizich . I recall the " now is not the time or place." And no
            specific mention that an endorsement would be forthcoming-

           Never said anything about a done -deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll ask Sharon to check on
           what Balding think she heard - pls give Sharon details so she can check . I said weeks ago
           "this isn't the time " in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate . Those who were with me at
           the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

           don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
           from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
           don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
           shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.
