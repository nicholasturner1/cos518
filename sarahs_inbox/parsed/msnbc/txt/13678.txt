              Commissioners - With the legislative session over, I am writing to thank you for ALL your hard work
              and assistance on budget and legislation. That being said, there is a lot of work in front of us in terms of
              budget review, bill analysis, and preparation for the June special session. The Chief of Staff will be
              contacting each of you individually over the next few days and will be scheduling a cabinet meeting
              later on this month.

              I am attaching a one-page summary of the FY08 and FY09 budgets that passed compared to the
              Governor's proposed level of spending. It is important to look at both fiscal years as there is a lot
              happening in FY08 capital. Governor Palin has asked me to convey her concern with the overall size of
              the operating and capital budgets. She is asking that in addition to your review of capital budget items
              including our requests and legislative additions, you also look closely at your operating budgets for
              items/areas that can be reduced.

               The Governor has been clear in her commitment to slow the growth of government. In preparation for
               the FY2010 budget, the Governor would like you to begin identifying programs or services that we can
               reduce or eliminate and what statutory or regulatory changes might be needed to accomplish that. So, it
               will be important to begin a review of programs and services as soon as possible if we are going to be
               able to propose these changes in the FY20 10 budget.

               Thank you again and I look forward to seeing all of you at the next cabinet meeting. KJR
