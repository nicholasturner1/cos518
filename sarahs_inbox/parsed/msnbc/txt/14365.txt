            UGH. I had a little accident with my blackberry a few minutes ago...it involved an
            .accidental submerging in water .     I now have to rely on computer and my other cell,
            Privileged for communication . . . just wanted you to know if I don ' t respond immediately.
            This sucks.



            Frank , do you have Wyatt ' s contact info? . Needless to say ,            I've lost my contacts.
