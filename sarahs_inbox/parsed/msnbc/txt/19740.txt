           MESSAGE:

           Dear Ms. Palin:



           Having read your statement about the contentions made by some who don't wish you any good
           (e.g. Mr. Halcro) I would feel alot better if you outright denied them. Calling them
           "outrageous" doesn't do this (and sounds like Murkowski-ish politico-speak). If you didn't
           get involved in that, an outright denial would be in order. If you did, then saying so
           would carry clot of weight with me. One thing that won't fly with me, though, is
           dishonesty. Despite not agreeing with you on some things, the fact that you struck me as
           very open and honest is why I voted for you. Whether you took a part in the dispute I've
           read about isn't nearly as important, to me, than if you are straight about things.




           42, Sarah
