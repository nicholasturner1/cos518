          Flts late, haven't left yet and sounds like it may be awhile.



          I can fly hm late tomorrow nite instead of thurs afternoon be we've got some thursday mtgs
          I can catch up on.



         Tib- criticism we're hearing at first blush on ACES is we didnt flesh it out before
         presenting. That surprised me, as we're being transparent with our thought processes and
         debate, thus we wanted to roll this out so Alaskans would know where we're headed come Oct
         18. Just fyi. Criticism was from Doogan, Crawford, talking heads on radio - but that's all
         I've heard so far in these parts. Some must have expected a bill to be rolled out today?
