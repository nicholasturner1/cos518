            MESSAGE:

            Congrats on your new son, Trig! Thank you for            speaking so well on behalf of those with
            " special needs " - my wife and I have 3 adopted         kiddos , each with unique special needs.
            They are an absolute blessing to us , and would          love to see more Godly families not be so
            fearful of these " kinds " of children . We call         them God's hidden blessings.
