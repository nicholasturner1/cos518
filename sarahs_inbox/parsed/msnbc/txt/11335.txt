             Just heard from Todd-he's awesome. You guys are so gracious to take the time to reach out
             to people-really. I always have your back governor, you don't even have to ask.

              I've read this scripture several times this week and thought you would appreciate: Be of
             good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart. Psalm 31:24
