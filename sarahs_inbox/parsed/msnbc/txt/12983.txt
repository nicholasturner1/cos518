                Dear Rep. Chenault,

                     Please accept the attached advanced copy of a letter from Kenai Area Fisherman's Coalition
                regarding our concerns with the lack of public process in the development and planning of ADF&G's
                intentions to build a new boat ramp on the lower Kasilof River. We believe this project should have been
                proceeded with public hearings, comment opportunity and complete habitat assessments.

                     We understand that this project is included in this years budget, therefore we request that you
                consider our concerns and object to this proposal pending proper public review.

                      Thank you for consideration in this matter.

                Dwight Kramer
                KAFC Chairman
