          Governor,



          I tracked down a copy of the letter. Lynne sent me a copy in PDF format. I will send it
          to Kris and have her print it out for you.



          The letter was sent under Lynne's signature in respone to a letter writing effort by the
          home school folks.  The letter basically points out that there is a new chair of the board
          of ed and they should work with her. Lynne clearly stated your support for educational
          choice including home schooling.



         After Pat Shier was appointed to the board and he reuested a work session on the issue. I
         did not hear of any reluctance by the board as they scheduled the worksession for their
         next meeting.



         Mike

          Did I see that letter that the signature machine signed re: glen beigel's homeschool
          issue ( s), i think it was in response to a letter he or the homeschool group must have sent
          us.
