           I got ready in six weeks when I ran Humpys. You can do it. The Mayor's Marathon is end of
           June, right? Perfect!

           Marathon?     Would that be an order or suggested guideline? Talis.

            Talis:

           I was just checking our stats this morning to make sure we were still ahead of Minnesota.
            The Presidential Challenge website revised the state ranking to reflect participation
          levels instead of the raw numbers . Alaska is number 1 in participation !!!!!!!!  Can you
          believe it ? The governor should be proud of us.

           Also , after my e - mail yesterday , more employees signed up .   We now have a 31's
          participation rate in the Department of Law ( 174 people ).      That is fantastic.

           I will send an e-mail to the entire office, but I couldn't wait to tell you the good
          news!

            Stacy
