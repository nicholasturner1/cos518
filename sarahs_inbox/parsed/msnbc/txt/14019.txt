                 On a morning radio show today, the hosts talked about who the most

                 honest and ethical leaders are in state government. First it was hands

                 down Gov Palin, followed by both Nancy Dahlstrom and Gene Therriault.

                 This talk came on the heels of last night's muni election and how people

                 desire change and ethical leadership.

             He rocks. He and his crew are doing an awesome job trying to get

              infrastructure and public safety projects back in the budget. They are

             Alaskan heroes today.



             Albeit ineffective , but heroic nonetheless.
