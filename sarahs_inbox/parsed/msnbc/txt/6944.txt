             Kari - would you document for me the times Bill Allen accompanied Murkowski and/or Clark on
             trips, incl the international travel(s) - some of these also included Margy Johnson.

             It will be necessary for you to ask other commissioners/staff for info on this.

             Kris may be able to get some of that info with you. Thank you


             Ahhh... imagining that irresistible "new car" smell?
