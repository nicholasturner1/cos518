                      Meghan.

                      I am available when you pick a time .               I strongly agree with Pat Galvin

                      that "Dr" Antony Scott needs to be in on the meeting .               I am currently in

                      Anchorage and must be here for my daughters 15th birthday on Saturday.

                      Thus, I could be available for a Friday or Monday AM meeting in

                      Anchorage if that works out.
