         Dare I say he seems to have an evil streak Sean .             It's heartbreaking to hear him.

         Gosh, I was kind of feeling left out while Dan Fagan picked on you alone-but no more--I'm
         proud to stand with you while I, too, am personally vilified by Fagan. J



         I've told my staff not to respond and I've got one person monitoring-having instructed
         everyone else to keep their heads down and keep doing their work-though their curiosity
         was killing them as they turned off their radio connections.
