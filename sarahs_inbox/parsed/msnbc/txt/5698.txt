            Boss,

            A small number of individuals have called into Mike Nizich today complaining that we did not check with them
            personally before appointing Larry Edfelt. Bob Penny is one of those individuals . I hear that he may be at your
            table tonight so I wanted to make sure you received a warning . We did check with a number of groups including
            AOC and received many positive recommendations.

            Bob is also claiming that Larry is not a sport fisherman . Although he did work a while back as deputy director of
            commercial fisheries, he has spent many years and is known for being a sport fishing guide in Juneau.

            If you really need some ammunition , you can ask him about Privileged Oland let him know he is receiving serious
            consideration.

            Mike
