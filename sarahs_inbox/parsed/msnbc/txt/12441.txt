                 Regarding a meeting with Chuck, he left a request on my office voice mail over the
                 weekend. He lives in Northern Virginia. He hasn't been in good health, but I'm sure
                 that he would make it to a DC meeting if you want him to do so.

                 If you are interested, we could contact him and try to set something up at the JW
                 Marriott.

                 Regarding your question concerning new developments , I think Chuck's basic
                 contention is that the State 's regulators are unaware of several relevant
                 circumstances, as reported by Chuck' s network of workers . The attached letter to
                 Congress seems to be a combination of situations where he alleges that the State
                 has misunderstood the consequences of certain events or was unaware of them.

                 Senator Stevens has asked me to meet with him this morning on earmarking policy
                 and perhaps other issues. So, Larry and I will be out of the office for a while
                 beginning at 10:30. If you want to meet with Chuck, Bre can help arrange a
                 mutually convenient time.

                  Sam and I talked about events over the weekend. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                   Subject: Latest Hamel Letter


                   Per Chuck Hamel's request , I have attached his latest correspondence to
                   Congressmen Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin ' s earlier
                   letter to the House Energy Committee.

                  I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond , and, if so, how.

                  P.S.
                  Governor, in a voice mail message , Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with
                  you during your DC trip.
