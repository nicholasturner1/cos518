              Governor Palin,

              I just read some news articles about you. God Bless you. You are the person Americans
              need. Keep up the good work. I am envious of Alaska. Do you have any buddies with your
              same character that could run in the corrupt ridden, laughing stock of the nation,
              Illinois?? I wish the best for you and your family. I know you are a busy person no need
              to reply.
