          OK.  Nizich has told Denby and Katz we are doing the wolf press release today. We will
          have the release by early afternoon. Also, I am working with Sharon, Lynne and Balash on
          the Agrium one and should be able to put that together pretty quickly.

          I did not respond to your wolf control question. Nizich is on the phone

          with Denby and Katz now. They are working on a letter and press release

                                                                 1

          to go out simultaneously. We can get a statement out right away if you

          like or I can push to have both finalized and out as soon as possible.
