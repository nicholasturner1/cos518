              We just discussed- no advisory, we'll just sign and then release final document, then
              we'll be available if reporters want to ask questions.

             Governor -




             Would you like us to invite the press to the bill             signings tomorrow? I'm not sure how big
             you would like this. We could invite reporters and            lawmakers to your office - or have
             something a bit bigger in the conference room. If             the bills are signed in the morning
             with press, I should probably send an advisory out            tonight. Please let me know - thanks.
