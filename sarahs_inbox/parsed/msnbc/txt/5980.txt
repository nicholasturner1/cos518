               Governor, Chris Maisch is asking his people at the Kenai fire to see if there is an appropriate
               road accessible site so you can participate. Your support is appreciated. Also Chris M is also
               preparing an updated set of talking points about fires and firewise that would be available for
               your use under the current dry hot conditions. Tom

                       Hi Tom: I could always road trip to the Kenai fire in the next couple of days if there's anything I need
                       to do or could do to help - let me know if I could do any good there or elsewhere with your Firewise
                       message. Thanks!

                       Also, very nice conversation with BP's Hayward yest. TRex was another story - told him I think we
                       should meet in person be he wasn't so friendly on the phone.. .to say the least. I look forward to
                       Mulva's conversation this morning.
