              If I recall correctly the fist was suggested by the Mayor of the North Star Borough as to include all affected
              flooded areas.

              Why is Doug Isaacson coming? There is no flooding in the City limits of North Pole...and he was urging
              lawmakers to vote no on AGIA I can get a copy of the letter he signed, if necessary.
