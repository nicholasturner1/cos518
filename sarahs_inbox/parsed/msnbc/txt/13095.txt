          Dear Governor Palin and Randy,

                 There is an attorney named Ralph Cashen who is trying to contact various people
          about his client former Nome Police officer Owen who was convicted of murder. He is
          appealing the conviction and is trying to re-open the investigation. He called me and
          wants to get me to have the troopers reopen the case because he has a "firm belief" of his
          client's innocence and believes the Governor would agree with him. He asked for my
          support to push for a new investigation and absent that my "permission" to talk to the
          Governor.   Privileged or Pe                           He is being told by my staff that I
          will not attempt to intervene in     a case an    a I cannot prevent him from talking to
          anyone including the Governor. So, he may call the Governor. He might imply he has my
          permission to do so because I have not attempted to stop him. Privileged or Personal Material
