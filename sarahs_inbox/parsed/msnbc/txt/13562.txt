                driving age in my family is also (I checked with Bristol and Todd, and i know Track is).

                  Governor-

                  Alaska has reached a milestone. More than half of Alaska 's residents are organ and
                  tissue donors. We are the only state to achieve this milestone. I was going to write a
                  quick press release thanking donors. Just checking to see if you are a donor - if so
                  I was going to mention it.
