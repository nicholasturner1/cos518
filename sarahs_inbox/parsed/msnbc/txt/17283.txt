             Subject: NPFMC press release
            The nominations were selected today for NPFMC. Feel free to make any changes. I didn't point out who
            the top two nominations for each seat are. Instead, I listed them all collectively. The top choices are
            Privileged or Personal Material but again I don't know if we want to point that out.

             For Doug Hoedel' s seat:
             Duncan Fields
             Gale Vick
             Jeff Stephan

             For Stephanie Madsen's seat:
             Beth Stewart
             Nancy Munro
             Sam Cotton

             Thanks everybody,
