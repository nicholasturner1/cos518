  Thank you - this information has been added to the Governor 's calendar so is available on Governor's
  blackberry . I have also added Todd' s Alaska Airlines Mileage number to the itinerary so that he receives
  the mileage . I have asked for an upgrade to first class so in the event a seat opens up they will upgrade
  Todd. The Exit Row Seats are by the window . Thanks, Janice

  Here is the flight confirmation for Todd Palin. Please note that there were no more first class seats
  available on the way to TX, so he is in an exit row seat for space.

  Please let us know if you need anything else!
