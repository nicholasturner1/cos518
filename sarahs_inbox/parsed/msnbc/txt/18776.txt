         Governor,



         Following up on Mike's note.. .Our plan is to be very open with the legislators about the
         process we went through and the information we provided to you. We will describe the
         teams, the direction they were given, and the results they came up with. Marcia Davis,
         Dep. Commissioner, will discuss the "econ" team that crunched the numbers on various
         projects and looked at gross vs net options; Jon Iversen, Tax Director, will describe the
         "admin" team who came up with the needed improvements to the net-based options. I will
         then explain how we came up with the various parts of the ACES proposal.



         If you are able to attend, I think a valuable message would be a reminder of our openness
         and willingness to work with the legislators on this proposal.



         -Pat

         Governor,



         The team is working on the following draft agenda:



         The draft outline:

         I. Intro by GOV

         II. Where we ' ve been

        III. Why ACES?

                                                                 1



                                                                                                               PRA GSP01_0005111

        IV. What legislators need from the administration to evaluate ACES

        V. General Q&A



        Except the introduction,       Pat and Marcia will walk through the agenda.




        Regarding the Senate , Russ talked to Lyda Green and extended an invitation to hold a
        similar briefing for the Senate .   Lyda did not see flying legislators to a briefing as a
        good use of resources prior to a bill being prepared .   Russ will follow up today by
        sending Lyda an email offering to hold a group meeting if they desire .   We will point out
        the House ' s interest in learning how we got to where we are and that we could do the same
        for the Senate prior to the bill being ready for distribution.



        Mike
