              Thanks very much for hearing him out and communicating with him. There's no actual
              "pleasing" him, but we are on his side re: deferred maint that must be addressed to
              protect our resources.

             Governor,



             I talked on the phone with Mr. Hamel last week and again this morning regarding his
             concerns.  His most immediate concerns relate to certain alleged maintenance and
             replacement policies BP has in place on the North Slope. He believes these policies
             promote short-term cost savings while putting critical valves and turbines (and workers)
             at risk.  He is aware of the upcoming state oil and gas infrastructure risk assessment,
             but believes the results of that effort are too far off. He believes the state needs to
             take more immediate steps to investigate his concerns. I am scheduled to talk with him
             again on Friday. Before talking with him, I plan to discuss his concerns and possible
             state response with Joe Balash and DNR.



             Larry

              Thursday morning , so might even be able to meet with him if that is preferable.

             control - and slhe still cant believe psio let up on GC 1 fire investigation.

              Governor,



              Unfortunately, the Hamel letter is a pdf, and cannot be pasted. Hamel is in DC, as far
             as I know. Jonne will be in the office in 30 mins, and will provide a more detailed
             report to this group then, including a summary of the Hamel letter.



             In short, the PSIO has been persistently working on this investigation (given its
            staffing limitations), and pushing BP very hard. PSIO has completed a thorough technical
            review that yields a defensible and final conclusion to the issues raised by Tom Bewak,
            and the final section of the report, an addendum addressing materials traceability, will
            be completed in the next day or two. We'll send it to Mr. Bewak directly and post it on
            the PSIO website.




             As I mentioned, Jonne will provide a more thorough sit rep shortly. After hearing that
            info, you may decide that it makes sense to meet with Mr. Hamel ( I assumed that's why you
            asked where he is)
