             She called from airport. Says she believes she has a way to skip judiciary committee and
             move bills further during the AGIA sp session... I said I'd explore.a "before AGIA or
             after AGIA session" if that would more likely lead to success w/passage of both bills. She
             argued that it's all about getting the right number of players there at the same time and
             figures only during AGIA will that happen. I told her I'm thinking of all options. She
             says no, they can't call themselves in - don't have the numbers. She said she's happy to
             give me credit - I said I don't want any credit, I want the bills passed.



             She said she ' s been out of town so hasnt kept up on all this issue , but surely she knows
             it's a hot button.
