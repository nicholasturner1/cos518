         Yes.  We have a meteorologist on staff who tracks conditions and issues health alerts.
         This done through our Air Division. There are alerts out now. Please contact Tom

        Larry, are your people involved in the air quality evaluation relative to the fires?

        Thanks! And I just told Doug Warner I'd visit dnr/ag in Palmer, so I'll do that after
        signings and fire briefing. There's lots of ash in the air    Tom and Karleen and Craig: I
        assume there will be a PSA alert about health impacts in this area with the ash?
