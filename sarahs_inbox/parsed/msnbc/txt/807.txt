Todd - Please see email below. They would like to see if you're available on Monday, January 21,
2008 to speak at the Alaska Marine Science Symposium. It will be held in Anchorage. You will just
be getting back into Juneau that weekend. I can respond directly back to them if you'd like. Thanks,
Janice

Dear Janice,

Thank you for getting back to me on this . Is there any possibility that Todd Palin would be willing to
                                                        i
                                                                                   ROSTON 01333

speak at the event? I know the Palins are intricately connected with Alaska's fisheries and we would
be really thrilled if we could hear from them here. Would you mind checking if he would be available
for the event?



I really appreciate your help, and hope that you also have a wonderful holiday!



Thank you!

Carin
