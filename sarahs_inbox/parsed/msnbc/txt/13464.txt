             MESSAGE:

            Dear Sarah,



            Congratulations on Trig. You both are beautiful parents. Trig is very lucky to have both
            of you and have a brother and sisters.



            I was blessed with four children who are David, Tom, Mike, and John Paul. My girl came
            between Mike and John Paul but she had Downs and did not make it to six months because she
            had an extra chromosome. I stared at the paper when they gave it to me. Those three extra
            xxx's killed me.   I counted the xxx's many times to make sure they were right on the
            numbers.



            You are doing wonderful things for our state. Keep your chin up. We will be praying for
            you.  I watched you on TV at the Prayer Breakfast. You gave a touching speech. Fly on
            that airplane anytime you want. Go girl!!!



            If you need a babysitter I will help. Chuck (at Gladys Wood ) will vouch for my abilities.
            He is a wonderful person and a great teacher!



            Love and Prayers,

            Mary Croffut
