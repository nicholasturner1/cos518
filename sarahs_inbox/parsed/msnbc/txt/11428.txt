              Governor,  For your information, see the email from Bill Walker w/the Port Authority
              regarding a story on the ADN blog, and my response back.   Also, we have asked Sharon
              Leighow to correct the statement w/ADN.

               Marty

               Bill,  This is not accurate and I have no knowledge of Sharon Leighow's making this
              statement.   As you know, AGIA is silent on reconsideration and the Commissioner's are
              still evaluating the Port Authority's request.  No decision has yet been made. I am sorry
              something like this occurred, and Tom and Pat, who are w/me in DC also pass along their
              apologies!  Also, we will attempt to have the Governor's office correct this
              misinformation.
                                                                     1

                From Sean Cockerham in Juneau --

                <http://www.adn.com/static/includes/alaskapolitics/012307-hickel-gottstein.pdf
              <http://www.adn . com/static / includes / alaskapolitics / 012307 - hickel-gottstein . pdf> > Here's a
              letter Wally Hickel and David Gottstein sent Gov . Sarah Palin urging reconsideration of
              her finding that TransCanada has the only pipeline proposal to qualify under the Alaska
              Gasline Inducement Act.

               "The decision of your administration will likely increase frustration with AGIA and
              result in rejection by the legislature," the letter says.

               The Alaska Gasline Port Authority, which proposes a gas pipeline to Valdez , has asked
              Palin to reconsider rejecting its plan. Palin spokeswoman Sharon Leighow told me that the
              administration believes there is no provision in AGIA for reconsideration . Palin's gas
              team has passed it onto the department of law for a formal ruling on that.
