               Subject: Capital Budget Funding
              Thank you for keeping the funding for West High, Romig and Tumagain Elementary in the capital budget.
              Hopefully next year we can get the funding for the library and the technology grant at West. I had a child
              at West this year, and two at Turnagain. Next year I will have a child at each of these schools. Your
              support of the schools is greatly appreciated.

             I think the issue I saw earlier in the story or the one on KTUU's website has been corrected . One of these
             mentioned that funding "four" fire stations had been vetoed, then it changed to "for' fire stations, and now
             I think it has been further corrected . I will double check.

             I believe there are 5 projects

             Sitka Moller park $300.0
             Anchorage south high $500.0
             Anchorage service high school $500.0 vetoed $1500.0
             Ketchikan fawn mtn $500.0 vetoed $500.0
             Palmer high $500.0 vetoed $ 1000.0

             So we funded $2.3 million and vetoed $3 million

             The communities or school districts could bond for these and potentially be eligible for 60 percent reimbursement
             from the state under the school debt reimbursement program . Not sure the sitka field is under the school district but
             it might be

             I did talk to carol but I got an email from her saying she was stunned by how many school projects were actually cut. So she
             wants to talk with me about what she can do in the future. Karen

             I've gone through Sean's story . It is definitely misleading . Service High's turf. And Sharon, for another example, he
             mentions a cut of $1 . 1 m to Covenant House without stating they received $3.9...but he clarified that the recycling center
             rec'd $lm of their request for $2m. And, Karen talked w/Carol.

             Sharon we need adn to correct re: vetoing astro turf - we did fund at $d00 g the Anchorage requests . Not sure what else Sean
             missed- we should all look and he needs to correct what we find , hopefully. Thanks!

             Good point. I expect we will hear more about that . Hopefully the initial flap will die down after a couple of days. Karen

              For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the capital budget vetoes to the operating
             budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the
             operating budget. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
             Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


             The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the process was in large part because the
             Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of her budget.

              Just my observations.
