              I know I've bugged you about this before, but for my own planning purposes when can I
              expect AGIA's completion review to wrap up so we can announce the conforming bid?



              Rueters, AP, ADN have all asked very recently. I am not telling them anything, but I do
              want to know. Thanks:
