            That photo is so precious.. .and would work great for a birth announcement.

            If you have thoughts about text for a printed announcement ... we'd be happy to put
            something together!

            Wow! That's a beautiful picture!!! I'm going to ask Jason/Andy if this one would work for
            a birth announcement.
