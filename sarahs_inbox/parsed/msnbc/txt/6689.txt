        It's that time of year again! Dust off your cleats, grease up your glove, stretch out
        your old, tired muscles (yes, I'm talking to you) and join us next weekend for as we
        participate in the legislative softball tourney out by Sandy Beach.




       Rumor has it, this is the first Administration Team to participate since the territorial
       days (back when men were men and Nizich was pitching for the White Sox).




       We're doing things a little different this year... everybody included in this email is on the
       team unless you send your express written excuse, notarized by the Lt. Governor, as to why
       you can't join your co-workers for a little 3rd floor team building and moral boosting
                                                                 1

         next weekend (yes, you should feel bad). Okay, I won't go that far, but send an email if
         you can't play in a game or two next Saturday.




         The motto is: Lose Two and BBQ or... Win Two; Play in the Championship on Sunday, and Then
         BBQ.  It's quick, it's painless, and no matter what your skill level it's always a lot of
         fun.




         Plenty of food, beverages , and extra gear ( I hope that wasn 't anybody' s excuse for not
         attending !).  If you know of others on the third floor that want to play send this on... it's
         open to everybody !  A special award will be presented to the person who comes up with the
         best team name.
