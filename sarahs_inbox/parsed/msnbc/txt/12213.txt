             Is there a Huckabee event too ? And did we rsvp for all the president ' s events and RGA
             events - those will be important. And even the D's candidate events?

              Janice, let me know if he is or isn't on the schedule. If he's not, I can call Nick and I
             also have a contact in his office that I've spoken w/twice.

              I'm going to check w Janice to see if he's on NGA agenda, otherwise maybe Nick Ayers
             could make cobtact with McCain so I could chat with him?

              Cam Ayers find us another way to get in touch with McCain? He obviously doesn't need
             Alaska , but it'd still be good to talk to him before too long.



               Hope you're feeling better!
