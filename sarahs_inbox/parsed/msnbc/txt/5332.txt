                 Governor,

                 Kris has decided to be your designee for Alaska Statehood Celebration. Linda Perez, Law, and Ethics signed off
                 on it. Its similar to you designating heads of departments to boards. We are finally going to see some progress!
                 I had a great time up north with Kris, by the way. I told her it was refreshing to be working with her again because
                 of our inherent belief in you, etc, etc, etc. We were getting fired up talking about bureaucracy and other things.
                 We had a good time though.

                 You'll see from Kari that Mike, Mike, Denby and I are hoping to sit down with you Monday re: North Pacific. We.
                 need to decide the 6 nominations so I can get them going on all of their paper work, background checks, finger
                 printing, etc.

                 Okay, that's all I'll bother you with for now. I hope you had a great trip! Tell Piper I miss her!
