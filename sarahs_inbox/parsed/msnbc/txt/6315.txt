         Mike - did Bitney ever write the letter in reponse to those writing to our office , telling
         us to call the special session - and then the response to Speaker Harris' letter asking
         the same? With new "demands " coming from some legislators and speculation from so many
         now - it sounds like those responses never made it to approriate persons (ie the
         Legislators).



         I have leggies patiently (but losing patience ) asking me "when" - I keep telling them it
         still should be in October.



         If those letters weren 't written, we need to do so now . Telling them what the plan is.
         It's only fair to them ( and the public ) to let them make their plans that month . They'll
         also need this time to be doing their own research on ppt . A letter to the leggies today
         let's the media /public get wind of it and it addresses the rumors and puts them to rest.



        Thanks Tibs!
