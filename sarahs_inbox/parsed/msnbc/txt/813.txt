Governor, for lack of nothing more original or inspiring to say, you're awesome! We support you and
Alaska supports you.



I'm truely ashamed of the senate president and to have worked for her. Tonight I've lost any respect I
had left. Never in my wildest dreams could I think anyone would make a person pick between
addressing their state or honoring their only son as he graduates from boot camp and will go on to be
a great defender of our country. I'm really just sickened by the abuse of power. I'm with Kris and
Frank-send her a flippin' dvd in the mail-she'd be lucky to even get a copy-she sure as heck doesn't
deserve the honor of seeing your address in person.

 And tell Track we love 'em and thanks for serving our country.

What next? What a way to kick things off...



I really cannot believe this situation. I pray that what the enemy means for evil, will turn out for good.
