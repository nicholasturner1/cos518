           Governor - I don't know if you have had an opportunity to speak with Mayor Begich yet. He
           called the ANC office at 11:00 a.m. to state that he needed to talk with you regarding
           KABATA - apparently things are happening on the local level, and he would like to discuss
           it before a news story breaks.




           Contact:                Mayor Begich

           Thanks, Janice
