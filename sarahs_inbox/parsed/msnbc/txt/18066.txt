              Rod Boyce with the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner called asking for a quick editorial
              board meeting while you are in town next week.

              He has asked the last few times you've been in the region and we 've sent others. I
              asked Karl to place this request in the folder for the next time you are in Fairbanks
              (meaning this time), but unfortunately he called to remind me of our commitment to
              try and get everyone together . With everyone in Fairbanks , I think we should try to
              do this meeting Thursday morning (8:30am ?) for an hour - prior to the wildland fire
              press conference . We can have Mike and Commissioner Irwin attend and fulfill this
              long-standing request, if that works for you.

              I've already left a message for him saying that it 's a quick in and out and your
              schedule is packed , but that I would do my best to see if we can accommodate his
              request.

              Thoughts?

              Thanks,
              Meg
