           MESSAGE:

           Gov. Palin & Family,

           I just read about your new addition. God has blessed you and your family. I spent the
           evening with DJ last night, a Down's family member and he is the delight of all.



           You have honored life and you will be so blessed with your friend for life.



           I realize that there is probably nothing my family and I can do to actually help in any
           way, but if you are ever in Southern California and Trig needs a friend, DJ is delightful.
           And, of course, we will commit ourselves to prayer for you and your family.
