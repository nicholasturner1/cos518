             Head's up re: what ktuu is teasing for tonight's newscast. Frank Bailey had a bit more
             info on the topic... If ktuu reports anything incorrectly I sure hope it can be corrected
             asap before Alaskans are led to believe we're refusing to disclose anything. Thanks

             Don't know what we can do about this- hard to fathom that it's characterized as me being
             the one refusing to disclose when I don't know what the report is and have not refused
             anything- do we even know who was requested the info? I need to send this to nizich,
             Denby, etc to get some answers... Do you mind if I pass it along?

             No doubt.

             Professor Rick Steiner is questioning how you can claim an open and transparent
             government, when he has requested backup data supporting your stance against listing polar
             bears on ESA for 5 months. He wants to see if the State's biologists support your
             decision (to not recommend threatened status).



             Doug Vincent-Lang is the ADF&G biologist working on Steiner's request and said he's
             working with Dept of Law to see what part of the data and modeling can be released. He
             said that while previous studies could've supported a listing, the best available data
             today shows the opposite, in terms of increasing populations, etc.



             Bill asked if it would be a moot point to release the data after May 15th when the court
             is ordering Kempthorne to make the decision. He said it wouldn't be too late, because it
             would show if the Gov is making her decision based on science or politics. He also said
             he'd consider legal action.



             Came across as someone with a clear axe to grind.



             fyi, Katz said that the Canadian version of the ESA recently made a decision NOT to list
             polar bears as endangered, but simply as a "species of concern".   Interesting as Canada
             is much more "green" than the US.

             I saw it, and the issue is supposedly between ADF&G and the University. I'll get some
             specifics, but essentially there's a professor at the University that isn't happy with the
             State's slow response in providing some state data on polar bears.



              They haven't posted the story yet but I'll check my DVR and get some details off the 6pm
             spot on it.

             I guess I ' ll see where they ' re going on the news tonight , but I know nothing about a
             scientific report that I'm refusing to disclose . If anything can be addressed between now
             and when KTUU rings some bell that we may not be able to un-ring , pis do whatever we can
             to make sure they're not incorrectly reporting anything . And if anyone knows about this
             report, I need to know what the issue is. Thanks
