          J- how is it reflected in my TAs the couple of days I was "off duty" when I had Trig?
          April 18, the day he was born, I signed a bill into law and conducted a few State actions
          while in the hospital (and that should be recorded for the record)... but are there a
          couple of days in there that show I wasn't in the Anchorage office? I didn't see any...
