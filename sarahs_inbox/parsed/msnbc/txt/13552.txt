             Spoke to Richard for about 20 mins just now. He's disgusted and said if someone had a
             concern they should come to him-and he'd tell them it was BS.



             He said the gov has been great to him and she's probably the best gov we've ever had.

             Very hurtful that someone would try to put that wedge between an ill legislator and any of
             us. Deceitful.

             We also had that nice billing signing ceremony in Foster' s office.

            And Todd personally called Foster in the hospital and he wept on the phone because he was
            so appreciative . Doubt they passed on that piece of info.



             gov.sarah@yahoo.com wrote: Absolutely false. This sounds like another Bitney deal - he's
             good friends with Foster, he's helping Foster... But I've never heard of any request at
             all like this except would I donate a "lunch with the Governor" for a Foster fundraiser
             and of course I said I sure would!



             Erika, Mike,   anyone else : any info on this?



             Maybe soon Shelia will connect dots and understand that people do tell her lies just to
             rile us up and/or make us look horrible.

             Governor - I just got this:



             I'm getting a whole bunch of messages that the House asked the governor to host a
             fundraiser for Richard Foster, or let them use the mansion or something and she refused.
             Good reason?
