                        Holy cow. Well, let me know what I can do because DNR did the right thing to
                        provide info to Alaskans, as the department is looked to for info - especially in this
                        environment of million dollar pr campaigns that are NOT getting facts out there on
                        either side of the issue. So much rhetoric - it's refreshing to see DNR just stick with the
                        facts and have them published the way they are now.

                        Governor, if you hadn't heard the "Yes" group filed an ethics complaint against DNR on the
                        web site posting. Law, DEC , and DNR thoroughly reviewed this for accuracy and procedure.
                        Looks like the blackmail threat was accurate. Ruth, from Law, and Ed, from DNR, are working
                        on this. We will keep you up to date. God bless! Tom

             This should offset the negative APOC news from today.

            Thank you! I had not heard, so this is good news. Thank you Denby, and DoL.

               Bill- hopefully F&G will get a chance to'comment on this positive development. Whatever
            our press folks can do to get the word out on this... Alaskans (especially those in rural)
            who expect sound management of predators should be reassured with this good news.

           Governor:  You should have received a ruling by APOC regarding our predator control
           informational efforts.   The complaint came from Alaska Wildlife Alliance, claiming that we
           and the Board of Game were inappropritely trying to influence the outcome of the election
           on Ballot Measure 2 .  The Dept. of Law ably defended us, and APOC ruled that there was no
           preponderance of evidence of us violating those campaign and expenditure rules.



            Of course , this is at odds with the ADN editorial today. Wonder if we'll get any
           favorable press coverage on this positive ruling for us from APOC in this controversy.



             FYI, DL.
