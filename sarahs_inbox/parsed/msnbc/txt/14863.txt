          Governor Palin,

            i just learned the details of the birth of your son , Trig .  I want to tell you how
          encouraged and excited I am for you as you bring another precious life into your family.
          I am a pastor in Northern Michigan with 3 young children , who loves life and believes that
          every person is made in the image of God. Thank you for your love for children and your
          love for life just as God loves life and children .   Your actions remind me of Ephesians
          5:1-2 "Be imitators of God , therefore , as dearly loved children and live a life of love,
          just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to
          God." Awesome - totally awesome .   Please know that you are having an impact far beyond
          the borders of Alaska. May God bless you and your family!
