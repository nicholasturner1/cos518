             Dear Governor Palin,

            I am writing concerning our water supply in west, south Anchorage. We, as a small
            community group, have been working to keep our well water supply safe for ourselves and
            our families.  A developement down in a used gravel pit has been started nearby and we
            have good reason to believe




                                                                  1
