        Yes, he was one of the ones (besides           Privilege       that Mayfield

        recommended. He lives in the valley which is probably why he has been

        in communication with Colleen. I've never met him nor have I spoken

        with him.



        Also, FYI,    Privile^ was at Track ' s graduation .       I talked with him but he

        didn't make it over at the conclusion of the ceremony. During our

        conversation, he mentioned his interest in LBC (I got the impression

        he has talked w/Ivy about this).
