           Judge Steinkruger called to discuss judicial appointments with Governor Palin. I wanted to pass this on incase
           one of you want to call her back. Her home number is Privile e . I'll send a letter of acknowledgment this week
           and thank her for taking the time to call.

           Thanks,
