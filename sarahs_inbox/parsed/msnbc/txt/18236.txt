        He has a great sense of humor . I just emailed him and let him know I need to discuss some
        items today.  Now if I could just come up with some news that was so good he would shout
        out during the sermon "Thank God!"

         Balash is in Juneau. I need to call him here shortly. We planned to

         meet up at the office today.



          The Premere ' s office asked if you would feel comfortable having the

         girls go a short tour during our hour meeting in Whitehorse.
