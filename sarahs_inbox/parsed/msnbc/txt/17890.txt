             Thank you, Annette, for all your time and effort on this event. It was an honor to stand with my fellow
             Commissioners in recognition of our employees' hard work. Feedback from my staff members was all
             positive - with the minor exception of the occasional audio glitches - although the Governor handled that
             with such great aplomb that it became a topic of conversation about how awesome our Governor is! I
             look forward to next year's event - and to working with you on retention and recruitment issues in the near
             future.

             Dear Commissioners:

             Sorry it was so crowded Wednesday in the 10th Floor Conference Room, if I'd known you were all coming
             I would have... made more room for you. Commissioner Von Scheben and I had lots of room in
             Anchorage!

             Thank you for taking time out of your busy days to support outstanding State employees. These are
             individuals whose efforts were noted and nominated by their peers around the state.

            Recognizing and highlighting excellent service within our workforce is a small step but I believe it sets a
            powerful example throughout the State. Your presence at the event helped accentuate that message to
            all of the employees, of course, including your own.

            I told you I would be working on recruitment and retention issues following session, and I remain
            committed to that task. Thank you for taking time to attend this event in support of your employees.
