          It's great to hear from you! There are very few anti's griping within Alaska, but the
          national media is getting their first taste of AGIA and they WANT it to be wrong somehow.
          First, the New York Times wrote that the gasline is no sure thing, quoting Bert and Lyda
          as recent converts against it ("We're shocked that TC demands $500 million from the
          state!"), acting as if you had said the gas was practically flowing right now. Recently,
          we hear that a Newsweek reporter wants to "blow the lid" off the real story that everybody
          knows we'll never get through Canada, and AGIA was all a ruse to get you to the White
          House.




          We'll continue to spread the truth, and explain the ongoing battle with the Producers.



          We know you're letting people around the country know about what Alaska has to offer.
          Thank you.

          Hello gasline team- checking in- hoping all is well with all of you. I hear some of the
          anti's are griping about TC-Alaska again, let me. know if I need to answer any of their
          gripes. You're doing great and people around the country are very excited about AK
          resource development.

            I hear that Exxon is attending the Monegan hearing(s)? That's odd.

             Again, hoping all is well and let me know what you need. Thank you folks!

             That is, a policy on questions from citizens, vs. media? No, there isn't one. Here 's what I'd say: Anything from a
             citizen that can be answered promptly or referred to the proper authority, we'll handle . Anything extravagant
             requested from a non -Alaska resident, requiring labor-intensive research, we must politely decline to provide. If
             it's an Alaska citizen , we'll try to get it eventually , but won 't make promises on timing . How's that?

             Yes - we can take care of this individual request . But see the Govenior's question at the bottom of the e-mail.
             She wants to know if the press office has set a policy on how to handle random questions like this.
