           Ashley was 7 when she died of complications of an open heart surgury.

               This letter is intended to be an indication of my sincere joy and well wishes for you
           and your family that may lay ahead for your journey that lies ahead . Ashley was and still
           is in my heart every day and if I may share some of my stories and some of my joys that
           she provided me with over her seemingly short but actually long and joyful life that she
           gave us than I would be honored to share some of them with you.

               Love and Light for you and your Family in your Journey that Lies ahead.

               Sincerely, Bumpa ( Ashley 's Grampa)
