          Subject: Untruths.,




          It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the DPS

          budget and contract results... especially in light of how hard you all

          worked to increase funds and provide tools that DPS claimed they needed

          to do their job . Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have been

          overlooked by some.

            There are continual.untrue claims about what we "did to the union",

          and this is unfair to you, to the whole administration , and most

          importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth. Please share

          your ideas on how we can get the truth out there so attacks on your work

         product and our committment to public safety can be countered with the

                                                          2
