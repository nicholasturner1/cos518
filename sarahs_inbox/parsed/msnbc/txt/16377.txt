                  Subject: Governor Palin/Fox News/Laura Ingram




                  I just heard from Virginia Grace, the producer of the Laura Ingram show on Fox
                  News TV. Ms. Ingram would like to do an interview with the Governor between 5:00
                  and 6:00 p.m. today, East Coast time. The subject would be the Governor's recent
                  letter to Majority Leader Reid on ANWR.

                  I gave the producer the coordinates for Sharon and Rosanne, and she will call at
                  8:00 a.m., Alaska time. If you want to reach Ms. Grace in the meantime, her
                  number is 212-301-5786.
