          Harris called me yesterday. He said that while the majority selected Juneau, none would be
          upset, except Juneau delegation,   should it be called elsewhere. With the duration and
          details unknown, the thought was Juneau may prove more convenient. He wanted to reaffirm
          that he is a proponent of moving the legislature. He also expressed concern over Juneau
          (delegation and press) grandstanding (not an exact quote). He asked that we keep his
          comments confidential. I was going to share my conversation w/Mike this morning and ask
          that he call him.
