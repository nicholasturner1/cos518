            You don't have to come in- it will be very casual throughout the day, I'll call if I need
            any answers to anything, but no need to come in. Thanks

            Governor - I forgot to ask before you left what time you would like me in tomorrow. We
            are trying to change the Kawasaki meeting to Monday as he is going to ANC tonight. Janice
