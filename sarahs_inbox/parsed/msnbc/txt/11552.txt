             Dear governor palin . Yes I can talk about Exxon tomorrow. I just got off the phone after
             an argument with begich .  I called him .  He had apparently told a bp group today that
             apparently a 60 percent recidivism rate is acceptable to the ag because I said so at his
             meeting with you mr and others last year .    I called to tell him I did not appreciate it.
             He then went on a rant .  Says our 350000 d a budget increase is a measure of our
             administrations lack of concern about crime . The criminal justice system is collapsing.
             The anchorage d a office is collapsing etc. He refused to acknowledge he had implied
             anything other than that in front of you I had said there was no problem with 60 percent
             recidivism .   Maybe I can cool down and say something about this tomorrow as well.     It is
             clear from his comments that he blames this administration for bad crime stats in
             anchorage .  I thought he had gotten past this theme but clearly he is putting a lot of
             focus on it probably anticipating it may be an issue in his senate race .    Talis.

             Talis - is one of the main topics going to be:. Amicus Brief - Exxon at tomorrow's press
             event? It could be the first main topic - then we'll be prepared for budget , AGIA , Habitat,
             MatMaid ... etc.
