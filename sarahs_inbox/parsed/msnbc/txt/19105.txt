           Hey!

            Was talking to paulette about the newsminer article and stevens' comments. Kevin (her son
           that works for him) called while we were talking and thought your comments re: akns
           wanting more info on his innocence were right on-akns do want to know this! He just
           thought the negative headline of the article was causing the heartburn. Anyway, I think
           your follow up comments (as does kevin) in the newsminer article were great! You stayed
           positive and said your relationship was respectful. Thought you would appreciate the
           comments from a Stevens' staffer... see you next wk.
