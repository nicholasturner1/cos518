           It's pronounced:

           Dih'-men-tiff




           I'll be at the conference and will pronounce it once for you -- in case there's any doubt.

          Still not sure how to pronounce her name , as I'm speaking this morning on naming the
          bridge after Shirley "Dih-men-tiff". (?)
