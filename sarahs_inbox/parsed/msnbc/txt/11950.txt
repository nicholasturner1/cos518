               We had to pull from a few lists on this. 63 of your 288 appointees did NOT declare what ethnic background they
               were.... that's one fifth.

               So of the known appointees, 10% (23 of 225) were Alaska Native from all around the State.

               I'll bring this over printed.

               288 appointments or reappointments currently sitting on a board.
               225 appointments or reappointments declared EEO information at all

               23, or 10% of EEO declared appointees (225) are Alaska Native
               23, or 8% of total (288) appointees are Alaska Native
