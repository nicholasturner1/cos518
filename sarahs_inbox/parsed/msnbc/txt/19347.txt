              If lobbyists Curtis Thayer and/or Ashely Reed did ANYTHING to deceive us or the public- they
              will be sorry. I heard enough "questions" today to believe we may not have been told the whole
              truth about Enstar's plan to work cooperatively w/us and ANGDA. Not good. We need to get to
              the bottom of it.

              I have called Scott, left a message and asked him to call. The message to him: Curtis is not the decision
              maker! There could be a lot of this, especially from the few talk shows and the naysayers against
              everything . We all need to rise. above it and get a pipeline. He needs to control his messages and
              messengers. We will control ours. Don't rise to the bait. Some want us to fail. Alaskans want this to
              succeed. Scott has worked hard for this . We can and will sort out the issues as we advance the
              partnership.

              Governor,

              Tom's calling Marty, who is going to call Heyworth.

              I didn't hear Thayer's comments on KFQD but apparently they sent the ANGDA folks over the
              edge.
