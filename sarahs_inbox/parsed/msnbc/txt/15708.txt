                                              Kenai LNG Export License Approved

             June 3, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today lauded the decision by the U.S. Energy
             Department to approve the application of Marathon Oil Corporation and ConocoPhillips for an
             extension of the Kenai LNG export license. The two companies filed for the extension in January
             2007.

             "In these times of economic uncertainty, this is great news for the state and its residents,"
             Governor Palin said. "This extension helps secure a future for the LNG operation and is another
             step toward ensuring energy supplies and energy security for Alaska."

             In January, the state of Alaska and the owners of the LNG plant reached an agreement that
             ensured there will be adequate supplies of gas for local utilities. The agreement also required the
             owners to develop additional natural gas reserves In Cook Inlet and allow third parties the
             opportunity to monetize their gas production through the LNG plant. Marathon and ConocoPhillips
             have also agreed to sell Cook Inlet seismic and well data to third parties.

             The Kenai LNG facility, located in Nikiski, is the only LNG export plant in North America. The facility
             initiated operations in 1969 and today employs 58 people; the plant also supports 128 other jobs in
             the Kenai community. In addition, the operations of the plant contribute approximately $50 million
             in royalties and taxes to the state and local economies.
