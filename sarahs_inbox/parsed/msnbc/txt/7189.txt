            Governor - the Department of Law does review all of the appropriation bills and makes
            recommendations for your consideration. We will receive a fairly comprehensive document
            from them. All agencies are reviewing the budget bills and we will use all of that information to
            make recommendations to you for vetoing, reducing, or retaining appropriations. Hope this
            helps! KJR

                   Dear Governor Palin, I guess I have to clarify one thing , we do have the

                     "supplemental 21.5 million " for oil and gas which is for AGIA and other

                   related outside counsel for oil matters , which would be "capital " budget

                   - which we clearly do not recommend a veto for. Talis

                  Dear Governor Palin,

                            I will try to summarize what apparently is not forwarding.

                            When you receive the official Dept of Law bill review letter on

                  the budget it.will include a recommendation to veto the $ 50,000.00

                  appropriation for the Gateway School and Learning Center.

                             The Alaska Constitution prohibits      the use of public funds "for

                  the direct benefit of any religious or other private educational

                  institution."

                                      -   There is no dispute that this would be public

                  funds.

                                      -   We also believe this particular appropriation would

                  benefit a religious educational institution inappropriately because

                  under the existing four part test:

                                                     1 The benefit flows to only one private

                  institution

                                                     2 The benefit is to aid education

                  outside

                  a public school

                                                    3 $50,000 is not trivial

                                                    4 The funds would be given directly to a

                          Accordingly, in this particular instance we believe a veto is

                  appropriate.
