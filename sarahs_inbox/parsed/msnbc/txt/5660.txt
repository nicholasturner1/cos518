         Re: Privil
                      hooking up with r&" last nite; don't let them play you. Or me.

         That was a good, quick lesson in how most of these guys works and they

         probably take us as naive fools. Bit: it was meant to be that you walked

         into that restaurant last nite and saw that.



         I hear too often that stuff like that is happening be some think they do

         have us under their thumb. Again, glad you saw what you saw be I learned a

         lesson about Privileged ^ (and others) through that.



         I'm off to fairbnks
