             Subject : Task Force
             Kristan,

             Following are the names we've discussed for the task force:

            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             I know you're slammed right now so I'll give them a call and ensure their commitment to serve. I'll also let
             them know that you'll be following up w/them on organization of the task force. I'll provide you contact
             information as well.

            Also, Mike is checking with law on when Joe Austerman can get in to Mat Maid and do a review (email,
            hard drives, etc.).

             I'll let you know once I've contacted everyone listed above.

             Kris
