             I agree that we should have included that but think the recipients will know. At least,
             the recipients we're most concerned about.

            Looks good- will people know, though, that you're talking about the AGIA special session?
            We don't mention that in opening this statement about a sp session.

             Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request



             April 23 ,   2008 , Anchorage , Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda

             Green ' s request to expand the call of the special session to include

             abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin today outlined her willingness to

             consider a separate call if the Senate President can show a path to

             success.



             House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial - birth abortion,

             and House Bill 364 , relating to parental consent, failed due to inaction

             by the Senate .    The Governor expressed disappointment that Senate

             President Green did not exhaust every possible option during the regular

             session to move the legislation.



             "Alaskans know I am pro - life and have never wavered in my belief in the

             sanctity of every human life," Governor Palin said .        " These issues are

             so important they shouldn ' t be diluted with oil and gas deliberations."



             Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do

             differently than last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a

             vote on both bills by the full Senate.
