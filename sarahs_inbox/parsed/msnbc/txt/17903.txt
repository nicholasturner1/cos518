            I sure appreciated that event - and thanks to Annette for coordinating everything. Thanks to
            commissioners for participating. Staff surely was thankful.

            Next year I will give it more time, too.

            Thanks, all, for all of your great work for Alaskans! You're leading your departments superbly.
            You are sincerely appreciated.

              Annette,

              I appreciated the opportunity to be there. Walking over with the group from DEC, I can tell you
              all of the crew was excited to see the Governor and receive recognition from her and you.
              Although it did get crowded in Juneau, and the audio from Anchorage was sometimes weak, I
              think it added to the team spirit for the employees who were being recognized to share the
              experience. Many thanks to you and your staff for a very positive event.

              I look forward to working with you on recruitment and retention issues.

              Larry

              Dear Commissioners:

              Sorry it was so crowded Wednesday in the 10th Floor Conference Room, if I'd known you were
              all coming I would have... made more room for you. Commissioner Von Scheben and I had lots
              of room in Anchorage!

              Thank you for taking time out of your busy days to support outstanding State employees. These
              are individuals whose efforts were noted and nominated by their peers around the state.

              Recognizing and highlighting excellent service within our workforce is a small step but I believe it
              sets a powerful example throughout the State. Your presence at the event helped accentuate
              that message to all of the employees, of course, including your own.

              I told you I would be working on recruitment and retention issues following session , and I remain
              committed to that task. Thank you for taking time to attend this event in support of your employees.
