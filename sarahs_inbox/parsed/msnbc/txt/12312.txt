             Governor:
             I'm happy to assist anyway I can (talking points attached). As an
             employer, the State must protect the financial soundness of a plan
             where we have a $10.6 billion unfunded liability (PERS/TRS).   Much of
             this driven by increased health care costs. However, when as an
             employer we can invest $1 in preventive care and receive $4 in
             benefit by the avoidance of potential illness - that's a good
             investment.
             I understand your position that the State, as government - not
             employer - should allow private companies to decide within their
             member pools whether this makes sense for them or not.
