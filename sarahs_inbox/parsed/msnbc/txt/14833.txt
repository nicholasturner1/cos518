           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:




           Thank you for your fine comments on Alaskan Seniors last week.



           My wife and I are thrilled with your genuineness, leadership, professionalism, insight,
           and effervescence as Governor.



           My wife ' s parents are from Central Texas, have never budged , and I enjoyed sharing some
           thoughts with them about your recent birth of your son , your race home , the fish picker
           requirements of residency etc. etc.



           I am seventy-one years old, a resident since 1967, still in business here in Homer AND I
           am very excited about the unique and appropriate name for your new son Trig... a good
           choice!



           Sincerely and Continued Blessings to you and your family



           Paul Trygstad
