         Here are the rough stats I put together after talking

         to Bob Havemeister.



         -The avg. dairy farmer produces 60001b milk per day



         -6000lbs=706 gallons



         -Mat Maid pays farmers 21 . 08 per hundred weight



         -1,264 . 80 per day to farmers



         -that equates to 1.79 per gallon produced



         -461,652.00 per year to each farmer



         -2,308 , 260.00 paid to all farmers



         -Approx. 1,288 , 450 gallons produced yearly by the five

         dairies.



         -At a retail price of 4.79 gallon ,        equals 6 , 171,675.00

         per year gross



         -Since Alaskan milk only comprises about 28% of the

         Mat Maid product , multiply gallons of Alaskan milk by

         3.5 (imported milk )      and you get 21,600,864 . 00 total

         gross      ( of course this is using the 4 . 79 per gallon

         price and prices vary at different locations)



         -Mat Maids wholesale price to retailers in March was

         around 4 . 00 per gal .    ( I know it was 4.14 for convience

         stores ,   less at big stores ).      That price has probably

                                                              3

         gone up in the last few months.



         Conclusion :     If Mat Maid were to go to a 100% Alaskan

         made product , wholesale it at 4 . 00 per gallon, the

         gross after paying the farmers would be 2,845,540.00.

         The question is, is that enough to sustain a small

         scale plant ?     If the wholesale price went up to 5.00

         per gallon , gross would go up to 4,133,990 . 00.        We are

         only talking liquid milk here.



         Keep in mind that the dairies have their own problems.

          Some are debt free and others owe hundreds of

         thousands of dollars.



         ***Note! These are not all official stats so don't

         publicly quote them .       They' re based on some rough

         figures given to me.



         It will be interesting when you see their books .
