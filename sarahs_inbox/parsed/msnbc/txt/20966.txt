         Dear Governor Palin,

              I know you are very busy, if possible I would request that you perhaps could write or
         call the two receptionists who opened the threatening mail and were quarantined separately
         from everyone else on Friday. They are both young and good natured. They have to deal
         with a lot of unpleasant mail and people. They absorb the brunt of what is intended for
         me and other attorneys in the building. A word from the Governor would undoubtedly be a
         thrill. Talis
