                Subject: Response to Issues Regarding LNG Export License & Economics from AGPA
               Dear Governor Palin, Senate President Green, Speaker Harris, Members of the Alaska State
               Legislature, Commissioner Irwin, Commissioner Galvin, Deputy Commissioner Rutherford and
               Joe Balash

               As you return to Juneau for the final debate and vote on AGIA, I would like to succinctly address
               a few points regarding the All-Alaska gasline / LNG project. Several of these are considered by
               some to be stumbling blocks for this project. The facts, data, economics, and existing license and
               agreements suggest that there are no insurmountable hurdles to a successful LNG project that
               could expeditiously provide much needed gas to Alaskans.

               Economics

              It has been suggested an LNG project would have inferior economics to a Canadian project.
              Because of the superior pricing environment in Asia, an LNGRroject at like volumes will have a
              superior netback and net present value to a Canadian project in all reasonable scenarios. A
              smaller 2.7 bcf/d LNG project has a higher projected netback than a larger Canadian line in most
              scenarios (with the exception primarily of very strong North American and very weak Asian gas
              price scenarios). Both the EconOne (page 46) and Port Authority analyses support the above
              conclusions.

              Export License

              Neither the Port Authority nor its Fortune 500 partners believe exporting North Slope gas will be

                                                                                                                Page 2 of 2



                an insurmountable hurdle. In 1989 DOE granted YPC an export license for LNG from Valdez. In its
                detailed and comprehensive decision DOE rejected virtually all of the arguments that a party would
                make in opposition to an export license . Consequently, there are significant reasons to believe either: I)
                YPC's existing export license will be honored by DOE; or 2) if not honored that a new license will be
                issued. Counsel for the Port Authority has prepared a 12 page report on the applicable law which, along
                with the relevant DOE precedent, are available upon request . Legislators are encouraged to review this
                material to get a feel for DOE's decision making process and how strong a presumption at the federal
                level there is for allowing export. Legislators are encouraged to review this material to gain an insight
                into the DOE's decision making process and an appreciation for the strong presumption at the federal
                level for allowing export.

                 These are historic times and monumental decisions of generational import on how to move Alaska's gas
                 to market and to Alaskans. What a privilege it is for each of us - project sponsors , administrators,
                 consultants and decision maker alike - to be a participant in this process . As stewards of Alaska's
                 resources, we know you will leave no stone unturned or any opportunity ignored in these decisive final
                 hours. As always, if I can provide any additional information or answer any questions , do not hesitate to
                 email me or call me at 278-7000 (office) or 223-8530 (cell).
