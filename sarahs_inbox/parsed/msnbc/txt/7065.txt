        Here is some language on ocean rangers (if asked by a reporter).



        Ocean Rangers



        Our intention is to implement the initiative as approved by the voters. We understand
        that it will take some time this first year to ramp up and fully implement the program.
        Regarding the level of funding, we do not believe that we can develop a responsible plan
        with only $1.2 million. We will do the best we can but we may need to request a
        supplemental appropriation.  The legislature has indicated that they would support such a
        request.

        Attached is the proposed speech for the press conference tomorrow,

        tentatively scheduled for 11am.        Please look through and provide any

        input as quickly as possible. I believe it reflects a conversation

        with Karen, Sharon, and Chris post press availability early this

        morning.



        I have a meeting with gasline members at Sam and will not be available

        until 9am. Unless you are the Governor, please only make factual

        changes at this point, as everyone most assuredly would have other

        changes as well.



        I've added a few possible Q&As at the bottom - if they need amending,

        let me know. Any changes that you make and forward, please cc: all so

        that we know what's been said and we don't have numerous versions out

        there.



        Thank you!

        Meg
