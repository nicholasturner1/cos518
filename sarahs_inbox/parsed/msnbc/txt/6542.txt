           All is well be after picking up Willow from basketball camp in Orgegon, then visiting
           family there and in WA, we followed the sun down here on our own contient - so no
           hurricane!  But I hear I'm missing great weather back home at this time.



          As much as I dreaded leaving AK (feeling guilty about vacation), it's been great to get
          away. Track couldn't come with us, but this is nearly a full family vacation and it's
          beautiful.



          Thanks for holding down the fort.

          Are you guys in the path of Hurricane Flossi (Big Island, Hilo or South side)? Hope you
          have more sun than clouds. Pls keep me informed if you change plans or need anything. Just
          not sure which island you're on. (I called Mike when I read the news but I'm not passing
          it on).
