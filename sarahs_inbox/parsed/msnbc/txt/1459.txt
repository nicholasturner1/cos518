This is the most frustrating thing to have to deal with. There is no doubt in my mind that they are
deliberately jerking us/you around regarding the use of the plane. I got a, emil today indicating it won't
be available now until the 27th of july. We need to plot a schedule for july and august and start
booking the contract charters for you.

Tell DPS that this is really outrageous. We're going on two years now.

  And now do folks see why I keep saying we can NOT rely on them and their promises to allow our
office any reliable use of aircraft? This really is a final straw . I do NOT want to hear them string us
along again - but please send them the message that this is very, very disappointing and now we're
moving on and away from ever relying on that mode of transportation.

We're working on a bill signing for late next week in Dillingham for the family. Representative
Edgemon would like to sign his Head Start bill in Dillingham and he'll be there Thursday, July 3rd.



We could fly you and the girls out mid afternoon on Weds. Janice pulled flight options and I'll bring
those with me so we can review tomorrow and discuss return if this is of interest.
