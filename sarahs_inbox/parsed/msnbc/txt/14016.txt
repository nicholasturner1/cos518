                 The Rotary Club of Kenai is sponsoring the 2nd annual Soap Box Derby here in Kenai. We
                 have schduled the "Tech & Tune" which is a practice day for May 11th which is the day after
                 the District Conference. We planned this time so any Rotarians that wanted to see cars, racers,
                 track, etc. would have a chance.
                 See the attached flyer for more information and photos!

                 Thanks, Dave Derry, Kenai Rotary Club President
