        Subject: Meeting Wednesday August 1




        Dear Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles, I will be in Juneau tomorrow, Wednesday August 1, is
        there a time when we could meet to review:

             The Marine Mammal Protection Act

               The latest request on KABATA and the report I have on what is likely coming

             The plan of action I have for the VECO matter based on our last meeting, it is a two
        page memo which I would like to confirm your approval of before I initiate it.

               Any time tomorrow would be fine. Thanks



               Talis
