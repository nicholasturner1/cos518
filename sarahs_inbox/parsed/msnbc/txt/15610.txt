            May 29, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today appointed Michael I. Jeffery
            to the Barrow Superior Court.




            Jeffery, 63, has lived in Barrow for 31 years and has a long record of legal service to
            Barrow and North Slope villages. Originally from Los Angeles, he graduated from Stanford
            University and Yale Law School before moving to Barrow in January 1977. He has specialized
            training in alcohol/drug addiction and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.




            "Michael brings a wealth of academic and professional experience to the bench," Governor
            Palin said.  "The people of Barrow and the Alaska judicial system will be well-served by
            his expertise and passion for the law."




            Jeffery is active in Rotary Club International, faith activities, and an Eskimo dance
            group.  He and his wife, Esther, have three grown children. The family does commercial
            setnet salmon fishing each summer near Dillingham.




            Governor Palin chose Jeffery from a list of candidates submitted to her by the Alaska
            Judicial Council.  She made the selection from the Council's list within 45 days, as
            required by the Alaska Constitution. The Judicial Council is an independent citizen's
            commission created by the Alaska Constitution.

               Hi Governor,

               Sharon L. is about to send out a media advisory on the bill signing ceremony for Monday . Wanted to double-
               check with you on Huggins?

               Just so you know, about 20 or so military members will be present.

               Thanks, Kelly
