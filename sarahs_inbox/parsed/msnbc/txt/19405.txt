           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin: I have an e-mail clip that I would like to share with you and your husband
           about what a difference you two have made by having Trigg. Rusty my husband and I love
           all children but we are particually fond of Downs Syndrome children and have worked with
           many and truly love them. I called your parents house to maybe e-mail it to them and they
           could show you. It is a true story on how this one young Down Syndrome boy made a
           difference in many people's lives. I personally want to Thankyou for having the same
           convictions that I have about handling whatever Heavenly Father chooses to give us. Trigg
           will bring you "unmeasurable" amounts of joy not only for you but your whole, entire family
           and he will teach everyone who gets to know him the meaning of "uncondtional love".
           Sincerely Tina M. Whisler
