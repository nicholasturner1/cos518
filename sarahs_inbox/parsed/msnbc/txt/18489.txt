          Can we help the Army with this one? Short notice. Requires you authorizing US flag to be
          flown at half staff on military reservations in AK. Janice turned them down. . .not sure if
          you did it to send a message or whether she just did it but thought you should know this
          was going on.

          Dilemma below; please let me know what you recommend. I'm thinking I should reply to
          Robert's email supporting Janice's answer, regardless of whether there's a way to help or
          not....

           Janice,




           Need some help with this issue ,         when a Soldier from the United States

           Army Alaska gets killed in the line of duty we would like the Governor

           to authorize the US flag be flown at half staff on military

           installations .     We are in a time crunch for the Memorial Service to be

           held at Fort Wainwright Wednesday the 5th of September .                How can we make

           this happen for tomorrow and in the future? I will also call to

           discuss.




           Thanks




                                                                   3
