            Governor,

            Pat, Joe and I have all been able to read the attachment and have been discussing some of these issues. Our
            plan is to do a little more work verifying several items and then get together first thing in the morning . We will
            coordinate our comments and get them to you . My hope is that we can do a dry run in the morning going through
            the talking points and the charts . Hope that sounds fine to you.

            Mike

           Talking points look good and strong. Only two or three comments.
