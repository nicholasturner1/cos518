           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:




           I am a former resident of Alaska (1978-2006 ) and, after 23 years on the regular UAF
           faculty, am now Professor Emeritus. During my faculty tenure, I witnessed one underlying
           problem that affected students, faculty and staff: facility limitations. Although one can
           dismiss this-as a common problem everywhere, that does not negate the need to address
           specific problems, especially for students.



           SB 221 offers an opportunity to address the specific needs of students at UAF through the
           construction of a Biosciences Facility (BIOS). The building will benefit many UAF
           students. All students are required to take science courses and many choose to take
           biology. Biology is also the largest undergraduate, graduate and Ph . D. program at UAF. The
           facility will help retain quality faculty, which in turn attracts the best students



           I urge you to use your influence to see that this facility becomes a reality. Thank you.




           James B. Reynolds, PhD
