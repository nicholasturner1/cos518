            Fantastic. Shall I have Sharon Busch scoot in tomorrow and send it? I

            know she would be more than happy to do it for you. As you know,

            Governor, Sunday at l0pm is the second highest rated show on Channel

            2 - after 10pm weekdays. It would give individuals the chance to call

            and interview both Curt and John. Monday morning works well, too.



            If it is Sunday, again, that being           said , has anyone called Sheffield?
