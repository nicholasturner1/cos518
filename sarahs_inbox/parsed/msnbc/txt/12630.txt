             Oh, excellent. Let me work on this just a tweak, and I will be making a statement about
             this tomorrow before announcing in our press availability that we've finally got an Energy
             Coordinator coming on board.



             This is excellent. Its pretty gross to know that there are still Clark/Murkowski
             apologists around the capitol - it's hard to know who to trust amongst the hanger-on-ers
             down there... and in Anchorage, and in the media. Clark's corruption plea should -you'd
             think - hush some of the awful criticism so many of us hear re: oil and gas... We
             inherited a clustered up, tainted mess and it's no wonder it's taken "so long" to undo
             some of this.



             I'm stuck in Seattle so can't do today's scheduled press conf, but tomorrow works.

            Here is a speech that I wrote as an Alaskan in just the last thirty minutes. I am fuming
            and no doubt Alaskans are, but again, they are probably going through the same emotions as
            last spring.



             I would be happy to talk with you,        if you need an ear.



            Warm regards,

            Meghan
