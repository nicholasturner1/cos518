         MESSAGE:

         Hi Sara,

         My name is Jennifer Castro, and I'm currently a Journalism Broadcast student at the
         University of Idaho where you graduated college from. Our department chair Kenton Bird
         contacted you earlier this year about me interviewing you for an article for the U of I
         Journalism Alumni newsletter. I have left a few voice mails with your Anchorage office
         about setting up an interview but have not had any replies. I am home (in Anchorage) for
         the summer and will be leaving on August 18th for U of I, and I would like to interview
         you in person before I go. My contact information is 208-596-9048 or
         jennifercastro@vandals.uidaho.edu. Thank you for your time. -Jennifer Castro
