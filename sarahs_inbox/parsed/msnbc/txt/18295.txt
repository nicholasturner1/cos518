         MESSAGE:

         GREETINGS GOVERNOR PALIN,

           MY NAME IS MATI AND I AM 25 YEARS OLD. I WRITE TO YOU ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND I USUALLY
        NEVER HAVE THE GUTS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING BUT I BELIEVE I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING THE RIGHT
        THING . I RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM HAWAII IN 2002 WITH MY HUSBAND , FREDERICK , AND WE'RE
        CHRISTIANS , SO NOTHING GIVES ME MORE PLEASURE THAN TO PLEASE GOD. WELL, I CURRENTLY ATTEND
        "REVIVAL ASSEMBLY OF GOD" CHURCH LOCATED AT 618 GAMBELL STREET AND THE PASTOR THERE IS MY
        UNCLE, PASTOR MOE TALI. WE'RE A SMALL CHURCH BUT WE DO THINGS THAT OTHER CHURCHS 3 TIMES
        BIGGER THEN US WOULD NEVER DO. MANY TIMES OTHERS TELL US TO CLOSE DOWN BECAUSE WE'RE SO
        SMALL . WELL , THE REASON WHY I'M WRITING TO YOU IS BECAUSE WE ' D LIKE YOUR HELP IN EXTENDING
        OUR "FATHER'S HOUSE". OUR CHURCH IS VERY RUNDOWN, ITS OLD, NOT TO MENTION, WE SHARE A
        BUILDING WITH PEOPLE WHO OBVIOUSLY DO DRUGS, DRINK, AND SOMETOMES EVEN FIGHT RIGHT OUTSIDE
        OF OUR FRONT DOOR. OUR CHURCH IS YOUNG AND WE HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN WHO LIKE TO RUN OUTSIDE
        IN !

        THE PARKING LOT AND PLAY BUT CAN'T BECAUSE OUR PARENTS FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY DUE TO THE
        SURROUNDINGS IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AND WE HAVE NO FENCE OR GATES THAT BOUNDS OUR SIDE OF
        THE BUILDING.  GOVERNOR PALIN, I KNOW YOU'RE WOMAN OF GOD AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
        BLESSED TO DO SUCH WORKS. CAN YOU HELP US FULFILL OUR LONG DREAM OF OWNING A BUILDING FOR
        OURSELVES? WHERE OUR YOUNG ONES CAN GROW IN THAT BUILDING TO BE FREE TO RUN WITHOUT FEAR?
        WHERE OUR PARENTS CAN LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND SEE BEAUTIFUL PLANTS AND FLOWERS, AND NOT 2
        INTOXICATED MEN QUARRELLING? I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY WOMAN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO
        VISIT OUR CHURCH AND INSPECT THE AREA THAT WE DO OUR FELLOWSHIPS. YOU CAN SEE IT FROM AFAR
        THAT IT COULD BE MORE THAN WHAT IT IS. OUR PASTOR HAVE TAUGHT US THAT "WITH GOD, ALL
        THINGS ARE POSSIBLE, FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE ". AND AS A CHURCH FAMILY, WE DO!! BUT AS AN
        INDIVIDUAL, MY BELIEF GOES TO YOU. I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE HOMELESS OR PUT ANYONE
        OUT OF BUSINE!
                                                                1

         SS FOR THAT MATTER.      I'M NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR PUBLICITY FOR OU!

         R CHURCH OR A 2-MINUTE SPOT ON THE CHANNEL 2 NEWS, I'M LOOKING FOR A CHANGE & IMPROVEMENT.

             THERES ALOT THAT OUR "LITTLE CHURCH" CAN DO BUT JUST DON'T HAVE THE ROOM OR SAFETY FOR
         IT. MANY WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND OUR CHURCH BUT JUST THE SIGHT OF IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IS
         TROUBLING. I APOLOGIZE TO HAVE TAKEN UP YOUR TIME. I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT
         YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES... CHANGING THE WORST FOR THE BETTER. THANK YOU FOR
         YOUR CONSIDERATION.




         MUCH ALOHA & BLESSINGS,

                              MATI "Matiana" NANSEN
