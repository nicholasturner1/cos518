             Dear Governor Palin,

                 Kenai Area Fisherman 's Coalition is forwarding your office an advanced copy of a letter we are
             sending regarding the mishandling of the transfer of PCSRF funds by the former administration . We feel
             these actions were unethical and possibly illegal. We are asking for your office and the Department of
             Law to commence an investigation of these actions and the related conflict they may have with ongoing
             Board of Fish actions. We regret that we have to take this action , however, we feel it is in the best
             interest of the State to identify unethical behavior so that we can move forward in an open and legitimate
             manner.

               We have furnished support documents in the mail out packages we provided for your office, the
             Department of Fish and Game and the Department of Law.

                We look forward to hearing from you on this matter. If you have any questions or require further
             clarification please don 't hesitate to call.

             Dwight Kramer
