              janice-rhonda:     Is there expectation for speeches at any of these venues? Q and A?

             At the villiage council?



             Have sharon/beth crafted presser letting public know of the travel? As I don't want
             Alaskans to think bethel has been ignored - the presser needs to remind that we've had
             seven commissioners/lt gov, plus staff, travel out there in past few months to help deal
             with their challenges. Thanks
