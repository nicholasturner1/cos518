           Stick to your guns on the budget. The Legislature is doing just what was done in the
           80's.  Just because there is extra money they want to spend it. We people of Alaska are
           tired of anchorage getting all the funding. You should take a trip to Kodiak and drive on
           the State roads. They are a mess and we need help more than Anchorage. I also would
           wager that there many communities in Alaska that can prove the same things.  But, just
           beacuse we have extra dosen't mean it has to be spent. We need a savings account with a
           princpal that the Legislature cannot touch.
