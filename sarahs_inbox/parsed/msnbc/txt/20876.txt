               Subject: Court Orders being violated - These are crimes in the State of Alaska that are not investigated nor
                        enforced

             To Whom It May Concern:

             These are some more court orders being violated.
             I also have pictures and video of the damage and items.
             Yet the Trooper's will not open an investigation nor provide me with any information I've
             requested.

             These are crimes in the State of Alaska that are not investigated nor enforced.
             The people involved:
             Kathleen R. Johnson -
             aka Ranell C. Cox
             aka Kathy Cox
             aka Ranell Bagge
             aka Ranell C. Johnson
              Our investigation shows her legal name as Ranell C. Johnson. We have Washington State
             Court documents showing this was the only name change. Her social security number has also
             been changed.
             and Edward Lee Cheeks.

             RE: Reported violation of court order 8/30/2008 4:30pm - 38365 Evergreen Dr Sterling

             Thank you, coming out to look at my Sterling home on 8/30/2008 4:30pm.
             The reason for this email is to provide it to the courts to show I did indeed attempt to file a report of violating a
             court order.

             I've have attached the court orders that Kathleen Johnson has violated. Would you please reviews these orders
             and confirm that you are not willing to investigate and or make an arrest in this matter . The damaged items are
             valued at around $ 20,000 not including the items in the house.

             I would also so like copies of the log notes and pictures of the items you took.

             The reason I'm asking you, is the records department, Trooper Shanigan and Guymon are not responding to my
             past requests for Trooper reports.
             Ms Holt and here son are directly involved in the false charges against me.
