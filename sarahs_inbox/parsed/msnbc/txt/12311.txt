             Dear Governor Palin,
                  I just received your email regarding a referenced scathing email from Sen. Dyson on a Native Elders
             Roundtable. I believe he is basing that concept on the 1994 Natives Commission Task Force. I'm not sure what
             the outcome of that was , however, I think he liked the concept.
                  I would note that Sen . Dyson has been the source of several communications that have an edge over the last
             year. I found an old set of files here including a letter to AG Renkes from Dyson in June of 2003 which started as
             follows:

                 "Dear Greg , I gave you the following questions Tissues to help us with and I have not heard from you in four
              months. Have you forgotten or are you ignoring these issues and me or do you not give a rip or has Frank got
              you too busy with his stuff? If you can't or won't help me, please suggest someone who can or cares. ..." on and
              on

                   My point would be that I think he has been writing scathing letters to the executive branch for years as
              almost a form of sport Talis
