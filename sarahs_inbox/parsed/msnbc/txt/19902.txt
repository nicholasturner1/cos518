          Hi Commish LeDoux - I hadnt heard if you named a deputy commish yet and was wondering
          status of?

             We'll hopefully be getting together soon at a cabinet dinner that will coincide with
          cabinet meeting... but feel free in the meantime to contact me at any time to touch base
          on Educ issues. I'll be in Juneau next week. Thanks

             Yes, Governor, I can do this if someone else hasn't already.

             Rosanne: can you do this - Letter to editor in ADN to be corrected:
             No, I was never Miss Alaska. Yes, I did take time to support the scholarship program with the video Andy and Jason
             took great effort to make, where rm saying "rah rah" in support of the participants... and my husband took TWO
             DAYS of his slammed schedule to judge the pageant even!!! He left commercial fishing early to keep his
             commitimentto judge the thing!!! (Ya know how much that COST him?) And the event itself lasted four hours - so
             no, I didn't make it in person, I was ending one Gov's picnic that day, traveled to fairbanks to meet with seven
             members of the US Congress on ANWR, but... Sheeeesh can folks find a few more reasons to criticize a "lack of
             support" on something. Argggggh!
               You know, I think I'll do my own letter of correction on this one.

             Lynne and others down there may have more time- tho it shouldn't take much-organizing on her
             part except for invites. I'll get a feel for where everyone is this week first.

             No, unfortunately not a whole lot of-progress. But it won't take much to do. If you'd prefer Juneau this week (I think
             that's good) I can contact others to work on it down there. Otherwise we can schedule for Anch next week and
             Patricia and Tara can take care of it.

             K- has anyone in the Anchorage office gotten closer to details on a cabinet dinner to supplement a cabinet meeting?
             We can organize it from the Juneau end if need be- we should do this sooner rather than later and it can be delegated
             to Tara or even Patricia or whomever has good organizing skills, but has more time to schedule it than you or others
             would have right now.
               Another thought if Anchorage locale seems unlikely is for me to get cabinet down to Juneau while I'm there this
             week and I host a dinner for them there.
               Just checking to see if anyone went anywhere with it the past two weeks be it can easily be handled from the
             Juneau also, realizing how slammed the Anchorage office has been (Anna would be great help from that end too.)
