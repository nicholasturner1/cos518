             I can be in the Anchorage office - teleconf - during that time if any participation or
             follow-up on my part is needed. Happy to do it.

             In case someone got left out of the loop. This presser seems fine, as

             it will be about the "three-legged stool." The Q&A could still be

             interesting.    We're o.k. letting the Senate do the complaining... and

             will be ready to correct any misinformation.

             have a good feel to it, but I'm going to keep taking the pulse and see
