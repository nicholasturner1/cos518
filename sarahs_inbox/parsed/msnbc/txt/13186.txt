            Governor:

            I just heard through Randy Ruaro that one of the maritime units - Inland Boatmens Union
            (IBU) is sending out strike ballots to its members. Apparently on the radio, a member is
            quoted as saying that "the entire west coast" maritime organizations will join in the
            strike.  well run that down, but wanted you to know in the meantime.
