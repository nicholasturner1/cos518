               Honorable Governor Sarah Palin:

               Frustrating news re: Kasilof Boat Launch. The House just passed their final version of the budget and this
               proposal is still on SB256. It went onto the Senate floor and they also concur, so it is in the
               Governor's hands to veto or pass.
               ****Please veto this budget version.

               Thank you,
               Audrey Stephens
               Kasilof, Alaska
