         Sheesh is right. We can welcome thousands of Juneau residents in at Christmas, but not the
         Colony High team. Give me a break!

         Just fyi. Word got out in Juneau that the colony football team asked to visit the mansion
         while they're in Juneau this weekend - Erika offered to use up old pantry.food and feed
         the boys something light like we always do with visitors to the mansion - esp because
         food's been sitting there untouched for months in that pantry... but two staffers created
         quite a controversy with Mike over this.



        Just head's up in case in does result in Juneau parents' letters to the editor, as Mike
        says Juneau folks may do because to them this looks like preferential treatment given to a
        visiting group of young alaskans. Sheeeeesh.

        Sorry, really, to be sarcastic about this Erika! But I had an hour-long conversation
        about this with Mike, after he spoke with Linda Perez and Karen Rehfeld, and the only
        thing productive that came out of that discussion was the acknowledgement that Juneau
        folks are watching very closely everything I and my family does. Mike says that includes
        things like $spent at the mansion.

        I love kids, sports, teams, etc and they are the people whom i WANT to host and be
        hospitable towards, versus some of those stuffy receptions I'm expected to host - and
        today I'm told that since I let the chef go that we can't offer to host a team??? This
        was the most frustrating issue I've faced in a long time because it's hyprocritical and
        nonsensicle. It was ok for Murkowski to wine and dine Bill Allen and members of the
        Corrupt Bastards Club, but I'm going to get hassled over how many old boxes of brownie
        mixes we use to serve a flippin' high school football team?



         I know we're on the same page on this one, but others in the capitol are not. Thanks for
         letting me vent. I DO appreciate you!

        These are good ideas. Just use what we have in the house, I'll go purchase stuff that's
        not already in the house if I have to, or I'll bring brownie mixes from home in Wasilla if
        I find the time to gather stuff up - and then the state won't have to spend anything to
        host these Alaskan kids so they can eat their brownies at the mansion, legally. And then
        from hence forth I'll remember that it's "an issue" to feed visitors. This should apply to
        ALL the visitors, too, though - right? Staff, legislators, Juneau community members,
        people outside my immediate family, etc who visit the mansion and previously would have
        been offered something to eat?



        I don't want to sound sarcastic about this, and it's not your fault and I appreciate you
        seeking solutions here - but I've seen what the state spends in our $8 billion budget, and
        I'm doing all I can to save money out of the Governor' s and Mansion 's budgets... so it's
        impossible for me to swallow that this became an issue.



        1 never thought accepting a team's request to visit their mansion would have turned into
        an all-afternoon controversy.



       Please don't purchase any food, flowers, decorations, bedding, etc for the house for my
       family. We're going to be under an unfair microscope and the kids and I will make do on
       our own with this food issue (it's evidently become an issue since we chose to save money
       by doing without a chef) until someone can put it writing for me what is legal, what is
       not legal to eat.

         The only request I have still is for a kitchen table upstairs so we don't have to eat
         meals sitting on the beds or couch. I'll purchase a cheap one when I get to Juneau, as
         that would be cheaper than buying a cheap one here and shipping it.

          "controversy" stems from the perception that I'd be favoring a visiting team from the
          Valley over the local Juneau team, and that "parents are sensitive to this, they may write
          letters to the editor", etc.



           What a crock.



           We've hosted so many groups, classrooms , teams , etc in the mansion and/or the Juneau
          office and no one has said boo about it.



            There ' s questions about who ' d pay for what ( food-wise ) if the visiting team came over.
          It's obvious the question is being asked because this is a visiting team, and not Juneau
          ( tho I was anxious to have the Juneau visit too). I am sickened by this controversy.



          A budget meeting where Perez and Rehfeld brought this up? These type of issues,
         obviously , were never dealt with by Knowles and Murkowski - I am sickened by this and
         Erika and I were excited to get to invite more Alaskan kids to see THEIR mansion, not
         ours.



          So as to not disappoint the team, but to not get me, my administration or Erika in
         trouble, no food will be served unless the team brings it themselves.., sounds like the
         controversy was also over "the State can't pay for the food since there isn't an in-house
         chef anymore"... So no food.



          Add to the solutions ' list Mike, Erika , etc so we can conclude this issue before it gets
         even uglier.



          Again, , I am heartsick that anyone perceived this a negative thing.
