         Governor, Kris:



         Please disregard the earlier email .         As I was working on a response ,          I inadvertantly hit
         send.



         Kristin responded to the ADN - she basically said that any decision Mr. Wells made would
         not have a significant impact on Mat Maid.



         Stephanie from Daily News was looking for controversy that isn't there.



         Sorry for the confusion.

          Subject :   letter from Rob Wells




          Governor:



          Have you read the letter Rob Wells sent to you regarding his plan to possibly put his
          hormone free milk venture on hold? ADN would like a comment.



          How about something like:



         The governor is pleased with the spirit of cooperation that has come about as we seek long
         and short - term solutions to the Mat Maid situation . Mr. Wells' offer to withdraw his
         proposal to produce hormone free milk is being vetted by the Board of Agriculture.
