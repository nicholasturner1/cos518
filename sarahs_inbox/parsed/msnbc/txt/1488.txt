Todd , our son , Jason , is deployed in Iraq as a Marine MP Kennel Master with bomb sniffing dogs. I
recently purchased the book "Sarah" and would like to have your wife sign it before I send it to him.



Next time you guys are in the valley or even in Big Lake I would be happy to bring it over to have her
sign it if it is not too much trouble.



Martin Buser already sent a bunch of stuff to him and his men and I would like to keep some Alaska
stuff going over.
