              Great message by Galvin in today's adn. Alaskans need that assurance that the doom/gloom
              rhetoric spewed by some can be tempered with our reasonable assessment of the 'environment:
              that AK is extremely attractive (bc of the points Pat makes in today's article)... It
              goes along with the Lt. Governor's point made about hope and opportunity this
              administration wants to, and can, provide Alaskans.



              Good timing with the interview, as recently it's seemed a positive message has been
              silenced , compared to industry spokespersons ' negative talk.



              Thanks, all!     And this will be an outrageously good week with good announcements for
              Alaskans!
