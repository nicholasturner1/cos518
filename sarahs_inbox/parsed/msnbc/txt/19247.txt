           I'd ask that you speak to him before his July 2 messaging even.

              And for what it's worth- I agree that gasline team' s messaging re: in-state has NOT
           been aggressive or passionate enough to remind Alaskans that my FIRST goal is, and always
           has been, taking care of AK first. We've met recently on that- with my reminder about the
           of "Putting Alaskans First" campaign promise of mine... and I'm strongly encouraging AGIA
           team to tell Alaskans (and prove to all) that that IS the mission here with AGIA. They
           hace regrouped on that and they're looking for opportunities to reiterate our commitment
           to in-state use first. Thanks!

           I will emphasize to the Senator that the Administration is very much on board with in-
           state use and also our plan for using petroleum revenues to address short term needs,
           particularly those related to energy costs.



           I think this is all we may need to do for now. In honesty, messages from the gas team
           have not registered well with the Senator although this may change in the aftermath of
           your recent meeting with him.



           When I wrote you earlier, I was unaware of the Senator's plans - and he did not mention
           them - to talk publicly on July 2nd and 3rd about his initiatives to "bring short and
           long-term energy relief to Alaskans." (See below).    His original idea was to use your
           initiatives and the second special session to show Congress how petroleum revenues could
           be used at the federal level.



           Perhaps, we should postpone a definitive response to the Senator until we see what
           transpires tomorrow.   In the meantime, I can convey your thoughts about in-state use, etc
          .and see how he responds.

              Also, hopefully he could weave in that    our Surplus Revenue Return proposal shows how
           oil/gas revenue DOES help ourselves as we    attempt to relieve burdens on AK residents by
           returning surplus dollars to them to help    meet the rising cost of living - it's a short
           term plan as we work towards conservation    and long term energy relief plans.

           Senator Stevens contacted me last night to find out what you would think about his
           testifying at the special session on in-state energy issues.



          .He does support an in-state solution. However, his primary objective would be to show the
           Congress how state oil revenues can be used to benefit the citizenry. He believes that
           the second special session will exemplify how opening ANWR and offshore areas in Alaska
           would provide significant non-tax revenues to the U.S. Treasury, thereby benefitting the
           economy in several ways.



          For whatever it's worth, I believe that this is a good idea. I'm not sure that anything
          will budge the Democratic Leadership in Congress, but the publicity should help keep the
          spotlight on Alaska's oil and gas resources.



           I think that the ultimate decision about his testifying must be made by the Legislature.
           However, the Senator didn't want to proceed without your approval. My guess is that the
           beneficial electoral implications are not lost on the Senator, either.



          I also mentioned to him that we would probably respond to Dan Fagan's Sunday column, which
          I characterized as beyond fair criticism of a politician in a situation where Fagan had
          previously been apprized of the facts.



           Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

              I plan on finishing a very thorough review of this report and then discussing it with COS, Commissioner
              Kreitzer, and Karen Rehfetd . My personal opinion is that at some point DPS management needs to lead
              and do the best job they can with the resources they have just like every other agency.
