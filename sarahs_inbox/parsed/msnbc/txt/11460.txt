             Pls don't speak with Tibbles on this yet- may I call you in a bit?

            Governor,




            I appreciate the voice-message you left me and take this very seriously. I have several
            ideas on how to address this situation. Do you want me to talk with Mike Tibbles on this?
               I hate bothering you anymore with this problem. I am in Juneau today.



            Thanks,

            Larry Hartig
