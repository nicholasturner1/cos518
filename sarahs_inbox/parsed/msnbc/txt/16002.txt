           Governor,



           Here are your remarks and event info for tomorrow's ceremonial bill signing (HB 166 "Check
           Off for Charity"). I've also attached a brief white paper on the legislation that you may
           find helpful. Bob will leave a briefing booklet in your vehicle, so you'll have it as soon
           as you arrive in Anchorage tomorrow. Janice will print out remarks for you today so that
           you may look them over at your convenience. I just wanted to highlight the following
           details:



           -this is a ceremonial bill signing

           -bill sponsors Rep. Thomas and Sen. Therriault are unable to attend, but will be honored
           in remarks

           -staff from People magazine will be present



           Please call or email me if you have any questions. Thank you!
