           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin,



           I wanted to write you a quick note to say, "Thank you, for seeing all children as
           special."  It was encouraging for me to read about a governor in one of the fifty states
           that is living out that message. Thank you for being an inspiration to others.



           Sincerely,



           Michelle M. Knudsen
