              I didn't talk to Bowles today. I mentioned in passing to Wentzel that I couldn't meet with
              him in Anchorage be I was doing bethel then Juneau on friday. I said if they needed to
              meet with me it would have to be sometime in Juneau.



              I will not have time for any moving/packing activity until friday before flt time, this
              week was way too busy to get any of that done- so I'll need friday to do so. Pls move
              gary's mtg- or he can talk to me on the phone some day about hismoose issues (after he's
              spoken to denby or whomever - nizich maybe?)



              If I weren't going to bethel I could prepare for my and the kids' move to Juneau - instead
              I need friday for that and I'll cross my fingers that I'll be finished by the time the flt
              leaves. If not- the departure time will have to be changed.
