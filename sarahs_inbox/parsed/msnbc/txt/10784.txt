              Thank you.



              Sure wish we could get our AGIA announcement out before anyone thinks we merely kowtowed

              The first attached page states that Rep . Lynn and Rep . Gara will introduce a Darfur
              Divestment Bill , to restrict investments of Permanent Fund , other state funds."



              The next two pages are a press release , dated Jan . 3, from the Sudan Divestment Task
              Force , Washington D.C. and reads " AGIA Bidder Sinopec No Longer Eligible For Federal
              Contracts:. President Bush signs the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act. New law
              will authorize and endorse Rep. Lynn and Gara's Sudan divestment legislation and deny
              federal contracts to companies linked to the ongoing genocide in Darfur: including AGIA
              bidder Sinopec."
