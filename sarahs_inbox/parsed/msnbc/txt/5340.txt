                   Thanks so much Joe. And if they happen to still be there on Saturday, remember I'll be up in
                   Fairbanks that weekend if they wanted to meet then.

                    Governor,

                    The request that came in from the White River First Nation came in with a date during your trip to DC. As
                    such, I made an offer to meet them in Fairbanks. The original date fell through and now Commissioner
                    Irwin and I will be meeting with them on Tuesday afternoon in Fairbanks . The reason for that location is
                    that they can drive there in just a few hours.

                     Joe

                         I guess the White River First Nationat Tms request for consultations were with the Murky
                    Administration that wasnaT"rt well received . Sarah is I guess planning meetings with them . SheBT"'II
                    probably dcepull a rabbit out of the hattED on this one. I see Sarah as the irPR LadylWD throughout
                    the whole project moving it along quickly, something no one else had the skills and/or willing to do. With
                    MurkyaTM5 people, it was probably the 8Eoepompous ass&ED approach in most of what they did or did
                    not do. Sarah has excellent PR skills as evidenced by her run for Governor.

                         The Yukon's White River First Nation is in Alaska this week trying to negotiate a separate deal for a
                    right-of-way should it natural gas pipeline be built down the Alaska Highway.
                         The First Nation, based in Beaver Creek near the Alaska border , made its pitch Thursday at a hearing
                    of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in the state capital of Juneau.

                                                                                                                                                                  Page 2 of 2


                         Connie Larochelle said the First Nation has members in the Yukon and Alaska and is willing to negotiate a deal with pipeline developers.
                         "We do know, for example, that where the pipeline enters into Alaska we do have a mass grave site in that proximity and we also have a fish
                    camp close to the Alaska/Canada border," Larochelle said.
                         "We would highly encourage anybody that is contemplating putting a project through White River First Nation to negotiate a consultation
                    protocol so that any impacts can be mitigated or avoided altogether."
                         Larochelle admits invitations sent by the First Nation to the oil companies three years ago asking for consultations were not well received, but
                    she says that' s because the First Nation also wanted the companies to pay for the negotiations.
                         Larochelle said the First Nation has sent a letter to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and meetings are being planned.
                         The proposed Alaska Highway pipeline would carry gas from Alaska ' s North Slope through the Yukon to markets in the south.
