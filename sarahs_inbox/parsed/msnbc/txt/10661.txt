              MESSAGE:

              I am in the lower forty-eight but when I read an article about the oil industry in your
              state & your fight against them I had to commend you. I wish you were gov. in my stste.
              It's time somebody took a stand against the GOOD OL BOY SOCIETY. This country needs more
              people who has the balls to stand up for the people. If you ever dicide to run for higher
              office and continue with your same courace I would gladly vote for you. Keep up the good
              work you're doing in your state & mabe one day you will make it national. Good luck in
              fighting corruption. Keep it up.
