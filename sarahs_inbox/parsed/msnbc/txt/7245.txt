        Gov,



         I spent more than an hour on the phone with Rhonda Boyles yesterday on this topic. As
        the BAC chair, she is prepared to carry whatever water you want with the board, but is not
        sure that the votes will necessarily be there.



         She also expressed some concerns about the employment contract that Vantreek has. It was
        negotiated 9 years ago and is pretty generous.



         Finally, there were some things said by Vicki trytten that make me rather uncomfortable
        and concerned.  I would like to discuss those items with AG.



         Joe

         Hell no will MatMaid close in a couple of weeks . Not on our watch will this happen. Dairy
        farmers were told their last day to deliver milk is June 27th. No back up plan for them,
        no notice except the assurance I've given them that we were working on a plan and
        supported the 600,000 dollars to figure out what to do next. The state just broke its word
        again if we were to roll over for the board's ridiculous vote to shut it down without
        proper notice.



         Vantryck has got to be removed today . Managers must be held accountable for disasters
        like this. Any investigation needs to take place re: what has happened with this terribly
        poor management.



         Farmers will be dumping their milk in the parking lot of DNR if we don't step in and show
        the leadership they're craving and deserving. Trust me, I know their frustration.



         MatMaid will not shut down and we need to get that word out TODAY be folks are panicking
        and quiting and there won't be time to rehire.



         Can BAC and Creamery Ed be replaced at the request of Governor ? These folks need to go.
        We need to regroup and get good business minds in there to figure out close - out plan in
        next yr or so, or re-vitalization plan for Ag.



          Pls respond asap so I know my email was received.



         Ivy- pls check on both bd's replacement policies.



         Meg- pls figure out new messaging that conveys my committment to sensible plan -vs- going
        with the flow of the bd's ridiculous decision to devastate farmers in two weeks. That's
        bull and we ' re going to step in a help.
