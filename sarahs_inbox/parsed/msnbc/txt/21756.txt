              Mike is great!

               "Go towards the resvoir of trust ...25%will help regain the trust of the people, 22.5
              represents a system that was tainted. the new administration has been more than
              trustworthy and respectful... let's put this thing to bed."

              I'm paraphrasing of course , but he was very thoughtful and wise . H fin is still going
              strong tonight.
