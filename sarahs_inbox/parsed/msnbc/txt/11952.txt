                 Subject: Meeting with AVAC / Loose ends

               Governor:

               Thanks for the time meeting with AVAC. Sorry if I did not speed Bert Hall along fast enough . I was watching the
               clock at 15-20 minutes and waiting for an opening but he was pretty steady.

               I will work with the group on their issues and loop the other special assistants in where necessary.

               Thanks,

               Randy

               Governor,

               I have the Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) from 1995 that Linda sent me and the Governor's House
               Position Description 2000/2004 . I should have them ready to send to you by this morning.

               The mirror should be arriving any day from J.C. Penneys and we can hang it up the day it arrives ; plus get Piper's
               room together with her new bedding.

               I apologize in advance for not making a decision and carrying it out in regards to this; I want you to be informed of
               the options to avoid any potential surprises.

               Options:
               1. Cedar closet The "If they can 't see it and we don 't talk about it" Plan. Before any workers come in- move the
               t-bed into the Historical bedroom (cover it) so its out of sight and leave the washer /dryer in the Cedar closet, so
               that's all the electricians/workers see , and make sure that any verbiage does not refer to a t-bed . Once the work
               is done we can move it into the cedar closet , plug it and it's ready to go. I would have a locking door knob
               installed , so that the room is kept locked at all times, this protects your privacy and keeps unwanted friends (kids)
               from using it. In the spring during phase 2 of the plumbing project the w /d would be installed in the linen closet.
               The 220 outlet can benefit the House in the future for a variety of uses, not just this one . If you 're comfortable
               with this scenario, then I'll get things moving right away.

              2. If you're not comfortable with option 1 , then I'll proceed with moving it down to the basement and using /sharing
              the dryer outlet.

              Gail, from the AK Club, had mentioned earlier that it needs to have a regular control panel installed as its
              currently set-up for commercial use. I can have them do that right away.

              Please let me know if you have any questions.

              Thank you,

              Erika

                Subject: Updates

                * staff job descriptions
                * outlets/washer/
                * full length mirror

               When you get a chance can you email updates on these . Our desire still is for an availability of power for sunbed without it
               being perceived as costs to the state to plug the thing in. So either plugging it in downstairs or wherever the washer/dryer is
               going, I do want to use the bed or I can try to sell it in the classifieds if it can't be used. Thanks

               And job descriptions are necessary so I'll know what 's legal, what is not to request of staff. Thanks
