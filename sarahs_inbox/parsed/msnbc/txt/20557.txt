               We can't have an amount until after the end of August. There are earnings numbers that don't
               close until August 31. We have everybody lined up to do in a 36 hour period what is usually
               spread over about a week. Permanent Fund Corp is ready to quickly give us their numbers on
               Sept. 2, then they go through a series of calculations and authentications. At turbo speed this
               year, we should have the check amount by the end of the day on the 3rd.

               Just to keep expectations in line, we think ADN has over-estimated this year. Their $2100
               estimate was a surprise. The PFD will probably not exceed $2050. But it's like a Christmas
               present, it doesn't do any good to set your hopes on a certain amount; just be happy for
               whatever you get.

               -Pat

               I remember seeing that the amount of the PFD won't be available until closer to mid September. I can check in the
               morning.,

               Let's get with Revenue in the morning and see if they can expedite the calculation , although I'm not sure that they can. But
               Monday should be a slow news day. Ideas on venue?
