         your time like that!

         Thank you for the fruitful outcome tho. AH has not been willing, at all, to hear truths
         about AGIA, up 'til now. Let's take him up on that offer, gasline team, the sooner the
         better We may not sway him at all, as I'm sure he gets an earful from his BP-employed bro-
         in-law, but let's do it anyway.



         You're a trooper Meg. Thank you from all of us.



          I just got off the plane with Kevin Banks and two other gasline folks. They are stoked -
          said they had a GREAT day with legislators today!

          Subject: Andrew Halcro



         After nearly tossing myself off the top of the Atwood, Andrew Halcro and I just completed
         a one-plus hour phone conversation - first, we spoke about the leak that he and the
         Governor discussed a job during the administration and perhaps his anti-AGIA rants are
         related to the fact that he didn't get the job. I reiterated the fact that this
         Administration had absolutely nothing to do with the leak (in case anyone caught talk
         radio today).  Secondly, I discussed aspects of the AGIA and expressed my disappointment
         in him that he did not take up the gasline team on the opportunity to have an
         informational meeting to ask questions and discuss the merits of AGIA. We ended the
         conversation quite cordially and now he would.love to take us up on the original offer of
         meeting with the team regarding the AGIA and his concerns that we've not taken some things
         into consideration, especially in our cash modeling, etc.   At this point, just filling .
         everyone in, but would like to know what opportunities may exist for this conversation to
         take place.




          Thanks so much,



          Meg
