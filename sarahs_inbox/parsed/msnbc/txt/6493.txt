          hi janice...I don't know what the protocol is for an informal evening outdoor wedding at someones home is, but
          would like the Gov. to at least know about it. Richard Stryken and Colleen Naczi on Aug. 17, in Palmer. About
          200 people. If Sean or Sarah can come 7PM. or want to know more please call me at 727-8111. Richard's
          home sits on about 140 acres at the base of the Butte and the setting is breathtaking. the invite includes their
          familes as well. thanks, frank 727-8111.
