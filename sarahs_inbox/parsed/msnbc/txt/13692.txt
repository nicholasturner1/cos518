            Governor Palin and I are pleased that the legislature completed Alaska's 2008 legislative
           session within the 90-day deadline. A number of the administration's priorities were
           successfully achieved by the end of this session, as we attempt to transfer our state's
           natural resource wealth into tangible benefits to Alaskan communities and citizens.
           Highlights include education funding system improvements and increases, increased
           community revenue sharing, PERS/TRS liability relief, a comprehensive crime package, and
           our Capstone avionics program for safer skies.

           Despite these successes and a $5 billion deposit into savings, the explosive,
           unsustainable growth in spending must be stopped. Even in the current season of
           unprecedented revenue, spending.must remain principled and targeted at constitutional
           priorities. The Palin-Parnell Administration remains committed to living within our means
           and slowing the growth of government, not just for the sake of the now, but for
           generations to come.
