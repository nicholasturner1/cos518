               Subject : HB 4002 - Resource Rebate
               Governor.

               Both Co-Chairs of the C & RA committee, Rep. LeDoux and Rep. Fairclough and some members of House leadership, Rep.
               Olson , Rep. Chenault? want to amend the resource rebate bill as follows:

                  1. Add the $1,200 per person resource rebate payment as a separate line Rem on the PFD checks and check stubs /
                     1099's (for people that get direct deposit)

                 2. Not have any supplemental application process for persons that did not qualify for a 2008 PFD. (This removes an
                    estimated 40,000 persons that our supplemental process in our bill are estimated to pick up ). This would save 40,000
                    x $1,200 in payments (over $40 million) and the $500,000 cost of Revenue to running the new resource rebate
                    program. These are persons in Alaska who don 't qualify for a PFD because they have not been here long enough,
                    etc).

                 3. So that we do not miss veterans who receive VA benefits that are reduced by PFD payments so they do not even
                    apply for the PFD and would otherwise be left out in the cold by limiting the $1,200 to persons getting PFD's, they
                    would creates a new alternative payment program for just those veterans . The cost for picking up the veterans alone
                    is probably under $7 million.

               In my opinion , we cannot get the bill out of the committee without these amendments but will defer to Kelly on her measure of
               the committee.
