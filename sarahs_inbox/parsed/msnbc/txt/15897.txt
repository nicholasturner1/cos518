            MESSAGE:

            I really and truly hope that you have an opportunity to become America's first female Vice
            President this year!  From everything that I have seen about you, America needs someone
            like you next to Senator McCain in the White House! God Bless you and your family and
            hopefully we will see " McCain/PALIN" on the ticket this November!




            Sincerely,




           Adam Womeldorf
