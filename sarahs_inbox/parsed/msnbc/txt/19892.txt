           Good idea. Randy- pls jot a quick note letting Privlle a know the circumstances of that
           email, and that by the time I saw it we were already checking. Then Holland can see the
           facts surrounding.

          She knows.     Days after   Privileged   sent the email, Meg Holland asked me to

          get her a copy. I left a message w/ Meg asking what her a name to track

          it down.     That is when   Privilege    called me.   I talked with   Privileged   for a

                                                                2

           few minutes and told I would pass along her information .              So in fact, we

           did respond to her.       Meg knew   Privileged   called me - Meg gave her my #.



           Meg knows that when an email comes to the state' s website it gets routed

           and handled by a special assistant .         She also knows that each email get

           a generic response letting them know it will be routed. I believe this

           email was routed to boards and commissions.



           Just a thought , rather than issue a statement that will generate another

           story -why not just      ( have the appropriate person ) respond to PrIVIIe a 's

           email?    I'm sure she would share it with the world.

           Sharon- did Holland even bother to ask if I received Privilege ' s emails?

           Please explain to her the issue re: it seing sent to general state gov

           account it did NOT get to me until many days later - by then we were

           taking action . Randy and / or others can more fully explain what happened.

            Sharon- I don't think ADN was ever corrected re: what happened to

            Privileged     s email she sent (offering to have me look at her files against

            Kopp) back on july 13. We need to explain I never saw that email until I

            traveled to Juneau amny days later, heard rumors there was one, so Kelly

            and I did our own investigating of emails until we finally found it...

            and by then we were advised not to contact her as wheels were in motion.

            The ADN writes about this as if I purposefully ignored the accuser's

            offer to provide me more information. Megan further reports in a series

            of quesions on-line that I must be asked "why no response ", all based on

            Privile g e   's email, and it's reported she had a follow up phone call to

            the gov's office and yet no response from me?

                  We need a statement on that - and again internally a strong reminder

            that recipients of volitile emails like that must be forwarded to

            appropriate personnel. (In fact, Mike, please do a memo on that to all

            admin assistants... this was a harsh lesson to have learned re:

            receptionists needing to use discernment on forwarding significant

            emails that seem pretty obvious to me they should be forwarded.)

                That one needs clarification be it could lead to potential legal

           trouble if it's assumed I received the accuser's email yet did nothing

                                                               4

            in response. (This email evidently was forwarded to three different

           depts, I believe)
