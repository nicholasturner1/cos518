               Fyi- congressman hall from texas is introducing a bill that would transfer ownership of ANWR
               from the feds to the state. I'm on record supporting the idea and his bill. It may be an interesting
               subject for alaskans to hear about. I've promised expedited development if the transfer were ever
               to take place.
