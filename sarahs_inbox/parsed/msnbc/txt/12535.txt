            Subject :                Stoltze


            I have an original letter here from Bill re: predator control, HB256 and SB176. Did others
            see the letter? There's no marking on this one indicating so.



            Russ - Pls let Stoltze know we take him up on his offer to help with these, and whatever
            else he needs to hear in terms of a response.



            Also, Russ - awesome job on KTLN tonight! Thank you
