               Good Afternoon,

               I just wanted to write and express my thanks for allowing the funding for the Kincaid Park to remain in the
               budget, I know that its a very difficult job to figure out what stays and what doesn't and I don 't envy your
               position because it will always be a no win situation as far as trying to keep everyone happy.

               Thank You so much for allowing the Kincaid funding to remain intact!I

                                 Thanks, Don

              Good Afternoon Governor Palin,

              I am sending this e-mail as an indication of my support for the Kincaid Park Project.

              I understand that there is a proposed one million dollar figure in the capital budget that you are currently
              reviewing and I would like to ask that you allow that one million dollars to remain in the budget and allow
              this project to move forward and become a reality for the people that utilize this fine facility.

              The Nordic skiing facilities as well as the soccer community Statewide will realize huge benefits from the
              upgrade intended for Kincaid Park.

               The Anchorage soccer community is in desperate need of additional fields in order to host tournaments that
               receive participation from communities around the State as well as the Yukon Territory, The Ina K tournament
               (Alaska's largest ) will draw nearly 3,000 players and coaches during the first week in June and that tournament
               is currently held in 4 or 5 different locations around the city because there are no soccer facilities in Anchorage
               large enough to host this event.

               Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the nation at this time and the continual increase in the numbers of
               kids looking to get into playing soccer has placed a real burden on the already minimal facilities in Anchorage.

               The Nordic skiing facility would also benefit greatly from being able to create its own snow during our less than
               predictable winter weather and the upgrades would allow us to host major Nordic events bringing even more
               recognition to our wonderful State.

               I really hope that you will give serious consideration to allowing this money to remain in the capital budget.

                                    Thanks for your consideration

                                           Don Castle
