        Just landed .     Poor Karen changed her flight to the earlier one we both got in at the same
        time.



        I will work on getting some support out there.

        Compass piece that illustrates all the huge contributions made to Anchorage already - Tib:
        obviously Bitney didn ' t have the leggies in the loop to the degree I assumed he did all
        along - my bad - but it would be helpful if dyson or stoltze could also write pieces,
        would some leggies help with the msg?

        True about SE. Its getting interesting , unfortunately , hearing the individual leggies
        digging in their heels now. Hmmmmm - this may start spinning way away.

        I AGREE . I ALSO JUST SENT A NOTE TO THE JUNEAU EMPIRE - HOPEFULLY I CAN FIND IT. SE
        LEGISLATORS ARE UPSET - FEEL LEFT OUT. WOULD YOU RECONSIDER ... I SAID NOT BASED UPON
        EMOTION. AD THAT YOU DID NOT MAKE YOUR DECISIONS BASED UPON LEGISLATORS . I SAID THAT ONE
        THING THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS THE SWAN LAKE INTERTIE WHICH BENEFITS SE.

         Huh?  I can forward to Karen to check on this (whatever point Wielochoski is trying to
         make?) But his accusation makes no sense.



        Any input Tibs?
