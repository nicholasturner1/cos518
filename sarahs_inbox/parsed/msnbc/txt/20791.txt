               Governor, Need to get your approval on the attached letter that we need to send out by Monday. We did a letter
               five years ago and this is a renewal of the 5 year plan to support leasing in the Alaska OCS areas.

               This has been reviewed by Tom, Joe, Marty and John Katz

               Please review

              MMS is soliciting input from interested and affected parties on whether to begin a new 5-year Outer Continental
              Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for mid-2010 to mid-2015 . The current 5-year program covers July 2007
              through June 2012 . The new 5 -year program would potentially address those areas that are currently restricted
              from leasing by Congressional Moratoria but were removed from Presidential Withdrawal back in July , and MMS
              is soliciting comments on those particular areas.

              Although Alaska's interests for OCS development were addressed in Governor Murkowski 's November 22, 2006

              letter to MMS and generally included in the existing 5-year plan , it is important that the State respond to MMS's
              solicitation and again demonstrate support for leasing in the Alaska OCS areas (Beaufort Sea , Chukchi Sea,
              Cook Inlet, Hope Basin , Norton Basin, North Aleutian Basin).

              Attached is a draft letter addressing the State of Alaska 's support for the MMS leasing programs . Facts within the
              letter have been checked. Reference material may be downloaded from the MMS 5 -year program website at
              bft:#Www.mms.gov/5%2Wea r/. This letter is intended and expected to be issued under Governor Palin's
              signature. The MMS comment deadline is Monday September 15, so please consider this a high priority turn
              around - I need to have your comments by tomorrow morning . Thursday September 11.9:00 AM. Once I
              am able to incorporate the edits , I will get the letter to the Governor's Office for circulation and signature.

              I do apologize for this short turn-around on this issue . I learned of the opportunity to comment just recently, and
              am working hard to make sure Alaska asserts itself appropriately and at the right time.

               If you have any questions , please let me know.

              Randy
