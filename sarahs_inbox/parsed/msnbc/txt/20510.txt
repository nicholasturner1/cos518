             Subject:                APOC Complaint on Predator Control Information




             Governor:  You should have received a ruling by APOC regarding our predator control
             informational efforts.  The complaint came from Alaska Wildlife Alliance, claiming that we
             and the Board of Game were inappropritely trying to influence the outcome of the election
             on Ballot Measure 2. The Dept. of Law ably defended us, and APOC ruled that there was no
             preponderance of evidence of us violating those campaign and expenditure rules.



             Of course, this is at odds with the ADN editorial today. Wonder if we'll get any
             favorable press. coverage on this positive ruling for us from APOC in this controversy.



             FYI, DL.
