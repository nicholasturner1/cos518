             MESSAGE:

             Dear Govener,

             I have heard about you and your belief in Transparency and honesty in government through
             my brother who lives in AK on a recent visit. I applaud you efforts and guts to stand up
             for what's right.  There is so much wrong with government and most of it is big money
             influence.



             I know I'm not native of AK but I REALLY admire you--THANKS
