          This all sounds very very good JB. You guys are working your butts off and it's
          appreciated and will be so successful. Thanks for this update - I look forward to hearing
          what their amendments and/or compromises are that they'd want to propose. Thanks JB!

          Today Senate Finance heard from BP, Trans Canada, and AGPA. House Finance heard from our
          team.




          Within the legislature today, the conversations focused on coordinating efforts between
          the House and Senate in order to avoid the need for a Conference Committee to reconcile
          any differences between the two sides. Generally, this is a very positive development.
          However, Monday's meeting will likely focus on how the legislative leadership would like
          to see the bill amended in order to get it into a reconciled position.



          Good side:     a reconciled bill speeds up the process



          Bad side : the legislative leadership may ask for compromises on our part about the bill
          in order to speed it up




          Generally speaking... with AGIA located in both Finance Committees, the bill is in position
          to pass quickly once we reach final consensus. With the 24 Hour Rule now in effect...the
          opportunity is available to move the bill very quickly. Given the two weeks remaining in
          session, this is plenty of time for the Committees to become familiar with the bill and
                                                                  1

          move it to the Floor for final passage.




          The key will be the negotiations with legislative leadership. Expect Monday to be a
          watershed meeting.

          Governor,




          I let Bill know that you would call him sometime this weekend. I did not commit to a time
          or day. Again, he is doing a story about AGIA for stateline.org -- a website for
          statehouse news from the 50 states. He needs 10 minutes from you on the progress the bill
          is making.
