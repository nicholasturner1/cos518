             Mindy and Russ tell me that Senator Therriault will be attending. Mindy

             says they also plan to invite Senators Davis, Bunde and Dyson and

             Representative Dahlstrom. The legislative team asked me to ask for your

             input on the invites, let them know what you say and they will take care

             of it.
