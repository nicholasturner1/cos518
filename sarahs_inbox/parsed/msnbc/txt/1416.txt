Governor - Thanks - those boys deserved it. I will make sure that these events are covered and that
you get on earlier flight out of JNU on Sat.



Rhonda - you should have copies of all requests and I will work with you early Mon. a.m. as there is
the Sealaska one in JNU this week and others in ANC also. Janice

J- my return from Juneau on Sat puts me in the valley after midnight (and that's if the fit is on time).
Can a flight be found that gets Trig, Piper and me in earlier than that?

J- first, congrats on the boys state championship! Awesome job Bears!!!



I'm looking at sched for the days I'm in Juneau - there are a number of worthy events that Rhonda
                                                    z
                                                                                    ROSTON 02556

has commented on.. .since I can't make these rural-oriented events that week she is welcome and
encouraged to go in my place. Pis make sure she's aware of the details of these invitations. There
are so many events all over the state these summer months, I really want our office represented at
as many events all around the state as possible, not just in Juneau and Anchorage.



For Rhonda 's consideration this week to represent me, there's the Holy Cross event, the RurAL CAP
event , Sealaska 's event , and Chenega 's event ... plus others . Pis pass on to her.



Also, events like Friday's big VFW event- I won't be back for it in Anchorage but want to make sure
someone is there representing me.



There are big events all over and I want to make sure we have someone at as many of them - esp
the big ones - as possible.



Attending as many as poss allows us to touch base w many communities and constituents as we
seek boards and commission members also, as we seek community priority input, etc. If I can't be
there pis run these invites by the LtGov so he's given the opportunity to attend also. Thanks
