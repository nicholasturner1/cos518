           MESSAGE:

           2/8/08

           Dear Governor Palin:



          I am a parent of a Head Start student at Kids' Corps, Inc. in Anchorage and I wanted to
          sincerely thank you for your kind hospitality on 2/4/08 while we were in Juneau. We truly
          loved visiting the Governors Mansion and meeting with you and your staff. It was fun to
          see Piper with you and realize how much our children love to be near us.



          I am also writing to express my opinion regarding funding for Head Start programs in
          Alaska.  I understand that you are working on the budget right now and ask you to consider
          this data:



          1)        Since 2004, Head Start classrooms in 19 Alaska communities have closed.

          2)    Research demonstrates that Head Start prepares children for kindergarten and sets
          the stage for a lifetime of educational achievement, improved health, increased family
          support and decreased criminal activity, all of which cuts the states budget in the long
          run.

          3)        Head Start will serve over 3500 Alaskan children in 2008.

          4)    Even with the large number served, two-thirds of Alaska's children, living at or
          below the federal poverty level, are not being served by Head Start.
                                                                  1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01_0011689

           5)    State funding for Head Start is not even keeping up with inflation .  That means, we,
           as the mighty and proud state of Alaska , are not supporting the most valuable and precious
           part of who we are - our children and families.



           The Head Start budget for the state of Alaska has stayed the same or decreased since 2004,
           while the cost of providing services , maintaining facilities , compensating and training
           staff has increased . We must allocate funds so our programs can grow and we can continue
           to serve those Alaskans who need us most.



           I am asking you to make sure the budget for Head Start FY2009 is not a continuation of the
           previous five years.  We have given Resolution # 2008 -01 to Representative Les Gara and we
           ask for your approval of this resolution. We thank you for your time , but most importantly
           we thank you in advance for your support of our children and families.



           Respectfully,

           Patty Wisel
