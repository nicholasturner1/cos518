          MESSAGE:

         I've just learned a little bit about you. It seems that you would be a highly qualified
         choice for Veep. But it also seems that you are very happy in Alaska. It allows you to
         be near your family and your other outdoor interests. D.C. would be a big change.



         Any substance to you being offered a position on the ticket with Sen. McCain?                     Are you
         even interested? Do you have your sites on the White House, eventually?




         Thank you for your time.




         Jeffrey S. Hudson, MD
