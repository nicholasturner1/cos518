            Would he be good to plug in? I remember him from Fairbanks.

            I followed up with Privilege nd will share with you when you return . It looks good but she had stipulations that
            need to be considered. s ared with both Mikes so either of them could fill you in as well.

            My truck gets here tomorrow!!
