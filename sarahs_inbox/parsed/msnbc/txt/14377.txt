               Remembered another comment from today as I heard a lot of ideas from residents about how
               to provide relief for high energy costs (I am not particularly endorsing any of
               these .. .just passing along citizen comments.)

                Here's what I heard:

                1. Why can't the state do something with the Healy clean coal plant to provide cheaper
               power (Steve and Tom know those issues better than I)



                2. Why can't the state suspend the oil tax for a time on in-state producer refined
               gasoline in exchange for producer agreeing to drop price of gasoline.
                                                                   2




                                                                                                            P RA_GS P01 _0016303

                3. Raise local property tax exemption to 100000 instead of just 20K.



                4. State should fund Susitna Hydro



                while these were observations from others , one point was driven home for me,..               Privileged or P^

               Is Pat G engaged in this discussion where tax revenues are being talked about? And, sure,
              feel free to pass to Tom , Steve...

                  Thanks for letting me know. I cleaned out the inbox and emptied the trash and email seems to be getting
                  through again at spameli(dalaska.com

                  I didn't see the final result on the energy cost emails we were slinging. If anything new, pls
                  forward. Thanks so much!
