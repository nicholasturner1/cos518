              Subject: Clarification on regulation 5aac 75.003
              Dear Mr. Nelson,

              On Thursday, August 14, 2008 the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) issued Emergency
              Order 2-ss-2-26-08 which raised the bag and possession limit for coho salmon in the Little Susitna River
              from two to three.

              In the past I have questioned what authority ADF&G has to increase bag and possession limits when an
              existing management plan does not contain the option for increasing said bag limits.

              Regulation 5 AAC 75.003 states that an emergency order may not supersede bag and possession limits
              or methods and means established in regulatory management plans established by the Board of
              Fisheries.

              The above referenced emergency order does just that . Regulation 5 AAC 60. 170 Little Susitna River
              Coho Salmon Management Plan limits the bag and possession limit to two fish with no option stated in
              regulation to change it.

              Therefore, it appears that ADF&G has no authority to take such action via emergency order. They
              may,under my understanding, do so by emergency regulation.

              Further, at the Upper Cook Inlet Board of Fisheries meeting in February 2008 the ADF&G submitted
              proposal 206 to allow them to alter bag and possession limits in the Kenai River sockeye salmon fishery
              and they noted in public testimony and via RC 2 that regulation 75.003 was limiting their emergency order
              authority. The Board of Fisheries agreed and altered the Kenai River sockeye salmon management plan
              to allow more flexibility relative to bag and possession limits in the Kenai River.

              Therefore, it appears ADF&G is fully aware of the limitations of 75.003 and yet they continue this season
              to not follow the regulation. I have questioned ADF&G directly numerous times where they may have
              been in violation of 75.003 and they cite they have talked with law about this and they are confident they
              have the legal authority to change bag and possession limits via emergency order authority. even with an
              existing management plan limits that authority.

              Of course that is in conflict with their own position at the Board of Fisheries meeting on Kenai River
              sockeye salmon.

              At this point I would like you or someone in the law department to respond in writing as to what authority
              ADF&G has in regulation or statue to override regulation 5 AAC 75.003 relative to bag and possession
              limit alteration when an existing management plan prohibits such actions.

              I would also like to note I am not questioning the rationale for the emergency order at this time just the
              authority.

              Thank you for your time on this matter. I look forward to your response.
