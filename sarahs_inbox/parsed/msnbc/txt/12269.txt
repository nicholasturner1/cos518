              Here's the quote from Hollis French' s press release: "Testimony was provided by the Department of Health
              and Social Services, which reported that the department has recently formulated a position on the
              legislation. "I am here on behalf of the department in support of this bill in the attempt to make health care
              a reality for all Alaska citizens," said Deputy Commissioner William Streur." Glad Karleen says it was taken
              out of context and that they're working to fix.
