                 Mike, you gave me notice today that there will be a funeral at Anchorage Baptist Temple on Feb 28 at 11:00am.
                 General Kaktus will present the flag to the family . Do you know if anyone will be there to represent the Governor
                 (Lt. Gov; Kris Perry; or Craig Campbell)?
