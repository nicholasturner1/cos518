            Dear Sarah,




                    I have been reading up on your career recently, due to the rumors of you possibly
           being Senator McCains Presidential running mate. Even though I am from Ohio, If John picks
           you as his running mate You both will have my vote.




                    You have done a great job with your state and I find your values and opinions on
           issues to be forthright and with conviction..




                       Keep fighting the good fight Sarah, and Semper Fi it




                                                   Thank you,


                                                                  1
