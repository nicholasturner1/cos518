Congratulations on the upcoming birth of your new baby! I have been inspired by your story and
seeing all that you are doing as a Mom and a governor. It would have been great to see you as a
Vice President contender for Senator McCain but you're doing a great job there! The Republican
Party could use a lot more like you.
