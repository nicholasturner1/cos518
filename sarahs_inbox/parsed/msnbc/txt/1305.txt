   Subject : Lyda's history on abortion bills
   Todd,

   Since Lyda's first session in 1995, she has only voted in favor of pro-life legislation.

   Between 1995 to 2006 she NEVER voted against or deliberatly stalled an abortion bill. In fact,
   she voted in favor of 10 pro-life/anti-abortion/anti-medicaid funding bills.

   Of those 10 bills, 6 she voted in favor of them in multiple committes.

  What's disappointing, during her reign as senate president, she added her name as a cross-
  sponsor to Rep Keller's partial birth abortion bill, yet refused to let the full Senate vote on
  waiving the bill from Senate Judiciary, thus killing an abortion bill!!

  During the years she was voting in favor of pro-life legislation, the democrats in her coalition
  were voting against them. In fact, her current majority leader always voted "no" and often called
  for reconsideration of aborition legislation.

  Here are the abortion bills Lyda has supported since being elected:
  1995/1996
  SB 105 Parental Consent Before Minors Abortion

  SB 24 Parental Consent Before Minors Abortion
  Lyda voted yes in (S) HES, and on the (S) floor

  1999/2000
  SB 300 Information and Informed Consent for Abortion
