           Dear Governor Palin,




           I work for the Association for Community Living in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. I just want
           to congratulate you on the birth of your beautiful new baby boy, Trig, and know he will
           prove to be a wonderful blessing through the years. I read an Associated Press article in
           which you note that when you look at him, you see perfection. I know many parents with
           children who also happen to to have an extra chromosome who couldn't agree more. Thanks to
           you and your husband for being such great role models in so many ways!



           Sincerely,



           Rod Lauder
