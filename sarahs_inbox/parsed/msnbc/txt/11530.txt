             Makes me sick to my stomach, as I know it does for you three also . Just wish we didn't
             have to spend so much time on this stuff- but we do be no one else seems to be too worried
             about it.

             It is too flippin' fishy and there just seems to be too much of these fishy things
             happening.

             True , true . And no way to stop it - I was just thinking on the flt though it' s fishy again
             that things talked about internally end up blogged . Never ending mysteries there though.
             Sigh.

            Kris. . .did we know who rfn was?



            My understanding was that there were non-media types on that press release mailing list
            also...and that it was a compilation of a few media lists (sounded like a mess last year
            when I tried to find Juneau-only media.. .gave up and just built one myself).



            It'd be interesting to see what Sharon turns up. It'd be very easy for a mole to get on
            that list...they probably just emailed and asked to get on it.

             There's a blogger named rfn. He started off as a big supporter, now he's a critic who
             picks and chooses what issues to support us on. This morning he posted the press release
             we sent out 4:45pm yesterday on Conoco"s response... and added that, essentially, I over-
             react and panic with responding via pressers -like it's a bad thing. How would this
             blogger have received the emailed presser unless he's a valid media person (and why would
             a legit media person bother to be a regular blogger?), or one of our folks sent it to him?



            Strange thing is yesterday it was one of our folks who, as he does so often, warned me I'd
            again look like I was over-reacting... and he did not want any pressers going out... He
            cautions often that it doesn't do any good and even though he say he agrees with me that
            we should be communicating more often and clearer with the public, he is very, very
            hesitant to ever want pressers or statements going out in response to timely issues.

              Trying to put two and two together here, trying to remember if this is the blogger who
              criticizes me but says very supportive things of a select few in the administration.
