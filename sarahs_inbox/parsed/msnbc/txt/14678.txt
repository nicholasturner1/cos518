           Hi,

                                                                 1

           Our class has made a book for Piper to welcome her new baby brother.

           My husband will be in Anchorage tomorrow and Saturday. Evidently his

           Anchorage office is on the same floor as your office so it would be

           easy for him to bring the book by.

           I originally thought he could give it to you at the Capstone bill

           signing on Saturday but he thinks that may be too hectic.



           And, a big congratulations to your family on Trig's arrival. Of

           course he will bring joy to all of you, and you to him.



           Give Piper a hug from me.



           Patty Winegar
