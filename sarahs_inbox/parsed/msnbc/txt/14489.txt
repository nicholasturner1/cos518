           MESSAGE:

           Although I am not a resident of Alaska, I am so grateful for your belief in God and your
           staunch support of the unborn. Congrats to you and your family on the birth of your son.
           Children are precious and meant to be loved; we are blessed to receive them for God. All my
           joy for Trig.



           Blessings from Ohio
