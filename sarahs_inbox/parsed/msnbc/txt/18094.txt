        Subject: Drue Pearce/Interim Replacement/Interior




        Secretary Kempthorne's office asked me to advise you that Henri Bisson, formerly Alaska
        State Director of the BLM and currently the Deputy National Director, will temporarily
        replace Drue Pearce as Senior Advisor to the Secretary on Alaska affairs. Henri will
        continue as Deputy Director while he performs his new role.



        The Secretary is apparently still looking for a permanent replacement. I have asked for
        further information about applicants and timing but have heard nothing yet in response.



       One consequence of the interim arrangement is that Hans Neidig, the Secretary's Anchorage
       representative, will play a more important role. There will also be a replacement for
       Jennifer Thompson, Drue's current assistant, who will be joining her in the office of
       Pipeline Coordinator.



       I have known Henri Bisson for many years. In my opinion, he is a strong and knowledgeable
       advocate on Alaska issues and is very easy to work with. I believe.that many of the
       people on this email would share these conclusions.
