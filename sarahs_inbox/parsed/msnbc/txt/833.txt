I am at a loss for words; but clearly very angry at someone or some procedure. You Governor and
this Administration deserves better. Unacceptable problem. We need to know what happened to
protect confidential deliberative discussions and must trust the team completely! Right now I am
certain that I trust those on this email and would add Pat, kris, and Frank. Tom

Sunny- the email you forwarded to a list of state employees this morning re: better communications
with Mayors just got posted on the ADN blog after being leaked to a reporter. Any idea who'd leak
such a thing?
