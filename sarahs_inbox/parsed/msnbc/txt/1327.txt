  Governor Palin,

  It was nice meeting and talking to you on the elevator and as you entered the A/G banquet. I too
  appreciate all that Comissioner Joe is doing. He is taking an unfair barrage of attacking from the CO's. I
  have always felt organizations including the public sector are more effective as a collaborative team
  working to solve challenges rather than aligning coalitions which reduce production and serve to
  undermine the'mission'. Thank you for standing behind a good man and a friend.

  Sarah... Great job of speaking to our Assemblies of God Family. You spoke from the heart; your
  faith, conviction and life choices as well as challenges spoke to us all. I am proud to follow your
  leadership of this state. You are a testimony to the state and more importantly to the Lord Himself
  and His kingdom. My prayers are for you.

  By the way. I for one love the mission and vision of the Department of Corrections. It clearly speaks to
  what drives us to do what we do. Thanks to all the command staff of DOC and the State of Alaska.

  For His Ultimate Purpose,

  Sam Humphreys, Chaplain
  Anchorage Correctional Complex
