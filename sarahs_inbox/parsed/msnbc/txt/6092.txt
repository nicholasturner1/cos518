         The shorter the better. An all-day excusion is a lot. Wonder if a sat or sun would work
         for this so I'm not spending a whole work day on the tour?

         He just called me too. FYI, he has a pending scheduling request in for the Governor to
         accompany him on a helicopter tour of the Denali Visitors Project. He is hoping to
         schedule this for either weds or Thurs of next week. She would depart of a Valley airport
          (Wasilla or Palmer TBD) at 9am, take a tour of Port Mackenzie, fly to Talkeetna, then on
         to the Curry Ridge project site in Denali State Park. Estimated time of return to the
         Valley is 4pm.
