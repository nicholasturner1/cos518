             Governor,

             This is the situation I described at the last cabinet meeting . You may recall I also passed out photos of the AVEC
             tanks that showed the proximity of the waves . I mentioned that ADEC was then working with AVEC and the
             community to have a plan in place with the necessary resources to move the fuel quickly if an imminent threat
             from a coastal storm developed . DEC did not want the risk of fuel ending up in the ocean and was prepared to
             access Response Fund monies if needed to do an emergency transfer of the fuel . Generally , we are required to
             seek reimbursement to the fund from the owner or operator of the facility addressed in the response action.
             There is an exception where the spill or threat of spill is due to an "Act of God."

             As I also mentioned at the cabinet meeting , AVEC was pursuing a disaster declaration through the NWAB. I
             understand from Meera's email that this request has been transferred to the state and a meeting of the Disaster
             Policy Cabinet needs to be scheduled . It seems appropriate , if the DPC finds this to be an "emergency", to
             consider all sources of funding for moving the tanks . Obviously, AVEC is interested in finding a funding source
             that won't be required to seek reimbursement from AVEC.

             One of the things I have asked the "Immediate Needs " workgroup of the Climate Change Sub -cabinet to prepare
             is a list of critical infrastructure (including fuel tanks that are in use ) that are threatened by coastal erosion , melting
             permafrost or other consequences of climate change . This will allow for better contingency planning and
             hopefully avoid future situations like this.

             Thanks,
             Larry
