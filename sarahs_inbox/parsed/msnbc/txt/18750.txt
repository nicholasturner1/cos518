          ph my goodness.



          Pls don't " ok" this until Talis and I speak . There's more to Begich ' s positions lately
          than they ' re allowing citizens the opportunity to realize.

          Sharon,

          Here is a draft of some possible language about resolution of the prisoner transport
          issue.

          Let me know if your folks would like to do a joint release and what additions / changes they
          would have.

          Thanks. Julie
