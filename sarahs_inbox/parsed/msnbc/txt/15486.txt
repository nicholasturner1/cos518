            Janice just called me a little bit ago; the Marines called her today and it sounds like
            most of them are now shipping off Weds morning so they'd like to do this Tues mid
            afternoon. She will be sending an email w/the exact details.3'11 be sure that we have
            pins ready and any thing else I can think of.

            In doing the Marine's talk before deployment next week let's make sure we have pins and/or
            other things to pre8ent them. Also, did they confirm that next week is the best time for
            the 48 soldiers?
