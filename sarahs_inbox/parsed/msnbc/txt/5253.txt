                    Subject: Governor's DC Schedule is attached

                  I have attached the Governor' s DC Schedule. Meg and John , please note there is a beginning and ending press
                  conference for Governors. I do not know if you want the Governor to go to that . I am waiting to hear from Exxon
                  about a meeting place on Feb . 26 at 2 :30pm, but they are trying to get a room at the JW Marriott.

                 John, please tell me any meetings you would like me to put your name on as staffing with Mike Tibbles and the
                 Governor, and I'll add your name . I told all folks as I made meetings that it would be John Katz and /or Mike
                 Tibbles staffing , so just let me know.

                 Please let me know if anyone sees anything that should be changed (even typos!) so I can fix it. Thanks. Kari.
