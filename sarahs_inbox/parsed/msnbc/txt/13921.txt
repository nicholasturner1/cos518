             Forgot to mention that since I'll be in Juneau today (morning flt arrv 9:47) I will only
             have access to my state email address sr.parnell@alaska.gov. So pls use that one today and
             tomorrow. Also, if you want me joining any meeting, pls just have Janice call Elaine at my
             front desk in Juneau. The only meetings I currently have scheduled that I can't easily
             change are betw 1:30 and 2:30.
