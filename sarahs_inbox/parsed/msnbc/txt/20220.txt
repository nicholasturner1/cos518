           Dear Governor Palin,




           I was inquiring to the First Gentleman's Biography page if he would be interested in
           listing the University of Alaska Southeast, School of Career Education's website:
           http://www.uas.alaska.edu/career_ed/index.html




           He visited our facility this spring and would love to increase our visibility to education
           and apprenticeships in Southeast.




                                                                I
