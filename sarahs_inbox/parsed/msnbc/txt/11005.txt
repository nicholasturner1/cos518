             Governor;

              I suggest Leo DOT be there also. He is on the AIDEA board and interested in the AEA
             decision.

             Thanks, Emil

             I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in the
             room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
             streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
             understand the urgency on this. Larry a part of this too?

              I,yda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either lying
              again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If she
              lied again , it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more deception.
