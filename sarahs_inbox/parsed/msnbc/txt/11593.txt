               Governor and Mike,

               The statewide fleet manager just sent this note- we 're checking it out and will try to get this vehicle available to
               us. I can also ask Fred to make the state x-class vehicle he drives available to visiting staff in lieu of rental cars.
               He could use his personal vehicle to commute to work when the state car is not available to him.

               I spoke with the statewide fleet manager and she advised me that x-class vehicles usually become identified and
               available in the summer months when agencies are returning fleet vehicles to DOT. She is going to watch the
               inventory this summer to try to find small SUVs and front wheel sedans that are in good enough condition to ship
               to Juneau for us. DOT turns x- class vehicles over to requesting agencies "for life"... and charge approximately
               $50/month per vehicle for their deferred maintenance/replacement budget . We would assume all upkeep,
               maintenance and repairs on the vehicles . She also thought that we could arrange for the vehicles to be stored in
               the Glacier Highway DOT yard when not being used by our staff.

               She knows we want the vehicles and will continue to notify us when possibilities come up.

              Shawn & Linda - there is a 1998 Ford Taurus (front wheel drive) at the DOT yard, 74K miles.
              Ken said its buried in the snow, but if you want to look at it he said it might work for you. It
              would need a new battery and a detail I'm sure . It used to belong to H&SS . If interested you
              can call Ken McBride at 465-1792.
