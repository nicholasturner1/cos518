             I did some checking and found out the following via Janice and Russ (his

             request):



             Rep. Joule's nephew, Martin Oktollik, Jr., died recently after suffering

             a stroke.    He was 39-years-old and left a young family behind (five

             young children, with another child on the way). Rep. Joule had been

             back home dealing with it, but is now back in Juneau.



             Russ is hoping you could call Rep. Joule. His cell # is (907) 350-5057.

             Rep. Kerttula also brought this up to Mike and she felt strongly that

             Reggie would appreciate it.

             Do I know the person? I'm wondering if I'm missing something with this

             request from Janice.

             I talked w/Janice and they were hoping for a phone call to him. I will

             get his number and have it for you tomorrow in case you call         ( unless you

             need sooner ). We will send a condolence letter.

            Janice said his adult nephew died last week , another Rep has asked if we

            contacted him- so if we haven't done a card for him yet would you print

            one out and send to Joule? Thank you
