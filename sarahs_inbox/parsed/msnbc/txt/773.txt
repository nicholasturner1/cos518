Hi Melissa,



Several months ago, I made the offer on behalf of the Alaska Trappers

Association to provide Governor Palin with a fur hat. For a variety of

reasons, it has taken us much longer than expected to pull this project

together. However, we are now ready to proceed. You previously relayed

Ms. Palin's preference for dark mink, black leather 'crown' and a

measurement of 27 inches (head circumference).



It is my understanding that she wants what we refer to as a standard

"trapper style" hat. We are prepared to move forward with that design &

it is the style that we would recommend. However, I figured it was

worth checking back with you. Considering that we have not yet begun

the actual cutting & sewing, there is still time to switch styles, if

necessary. Once again, we recommend the trapper style, but will try to

accommodate her wishes, if she would prefer another style. Please check

with her & let me know.



Regards,



Randy Zarnke
