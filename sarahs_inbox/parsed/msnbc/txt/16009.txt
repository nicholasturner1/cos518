           Madam Governor:




           It was a distinct pleasure to watch you on the Glenn Beck show,



           and I want to congratulate you for taking a stand against the federal " do nothings" on the
           drilling for oil and tapping our gas reserves . We desperatley need more people of your
           calibre to lead this country. You ' ve got my vote and support and all I have to say
           is.."You go girl".
