Todd - I emailed Norm and let him know that the November dates were not available with the
Governor and that we would put this into scheduling for December. Let me know if you get
something scheduled. Thanks, Janice

Greetings Sarah! I'm sure that Todd has probably heard some of the recent fishing rumors that
probably include some about myself. Some are probably true! It was a difficult decision to make
and was the result of a cumulative level of frustration but after 29 years with Peter Pan I decided to
move on. I figure I have at least 20 more years of professional service in me. With a passionate
belief in the value and potential of our fisheries I want to be somewhere where I think I can make
more of a difference and with that I have joined Snopac Products.

I would welcome the opportunity if it all possible to get 30 minutes (or more) of your time to convey
some of our business plans, but most especially my hopes and dreams for the Bay. I would also
hope that you know you can always ask me for what I would hope is some balanced perspective of
issues that affect our Seafood Industry. I'm trying to juggle some possible trips to Anchorage around
different meetings (November 29th, 30th and then again on December 4th and 5th). Are you in
Anchorage at that point and have some time? If not Anchorage I could sure come travel via Juneau.



Happy Thanksgiving and I certainly hope this finds things going well for You and the Family!



Sincerely,



Norman Van Vactor
