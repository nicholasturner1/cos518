           Good morning,                                                                                                        11



          Can you somehow plug me in with Mike N. and Karen R. so I participate in the development
          of your legislative agenda and budget? I'd like to play a meaningful role in these as your
          LG. And, I see it as necessary for a more seamless transition months from now with the VP
          potential you have.



          Sean
