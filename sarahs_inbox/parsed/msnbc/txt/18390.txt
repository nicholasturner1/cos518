          Begich at memorial service. His first in the fifteen or so I have been to. Deborah, his
          wife, has stood in for him a couple of times as has his city manager, Dennis LeBlanc.
          From a military perspective, its a good showing of state and local support to have elected
          people from each. Just thought you'd like to know what's new on the landscape.
