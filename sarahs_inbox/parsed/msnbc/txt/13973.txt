                THIS EMAIL IS FROM UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA BOARD OF REGENTS' CHAIR MARY K.
                HUGHES. Her direct email is : mkhughes @acsalaska.net

                Dear Members of the Alaska Legislature:

                I have reviewed the capital budget CS put out by the Senate Finance Committee today. As chair of the
                Board of Regents, I feel it necessary to communicate my concerns regarding the major renewal and
                replacement funding -- UA's highest capital priority.

                The amount for major R&R (i.e. deferred maintenance) included in the CS ($20 million) is seriously
                deficient when compared to the problem. Year after year the legislature has chosen not to fund major
                maintenance for the university system, resulting in a backlog of $750 million across the state. And, if
                the $20 million appropriation is not increased, the backlog will grow to $785 million next year alone.

                With over 6 million square feet of facilities and nearly 400 buildings spread throughout Alaska, the
                university requires about $50 million for maintenance each year just to stay current. As Senator
                Steadman pointed out in his press conference today, the Board of Regents doesn't make the
                appropriations, the Legislature does. However, the Board is charged with governing the university and a
                big part of that assignment is managing the public facilities in an efficient and responsible manner. We
                need the assistance of the legislature to accomplish this task. Since 2000, an average of $13 million has
                been funded annually for R&R against a $50 million annual need.

                The university is not alone in its maintenance challenges, which are shared by many state agencies as
                well. If the legislature continues to choose not to fund major maintenance, it may create a problem
                rivaling that of PERS/TRS.

                I would encourage you to increase the capital budget funding to at least equal the governor's request of
                $40 million. I would also encourage you to make an additional appropriation to reduce some of the

                backlog. Despite legislative comments to the contrary, the university can fully commit the $50 million
                in maintenance projects included in the Regents request this year - as well as $70 million in deferred
                maintenance projects. Many of these priorities are large projects and will take two or three years to
                complete, but they can't start without the funding. We have a great deal of experience in the area of
                facility maintenance and the projects are scoped and planned, and in many cases, ready to implement
                immediately.

               The facilities of the University of Alaska are owned by the people of Alaska. Please honor their
               reasonable expectation that these facilities will be maintained.

                Thank you.
