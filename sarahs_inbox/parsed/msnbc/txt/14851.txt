           MESSAGE:

           Governor Sarah Palin,  Many blessings to you and your family today. My family and I live
           in Homer and my friends and I pray for you and want to encourage you today. We believe
           your new son is a very special and his birth reveals the hearts of people. Surely Trig is
           close to the heart of God and so are you and your husband. I pray strength and courage and
           joy for you today and may you walk in that peace that passes understanding. Love in
           Christ, Sonja
