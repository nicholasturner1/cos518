         Governor:




         I have asked staff to review our authorities and concerns with your

         request to allow hunting season extensions for returning servicemen. I

         hope to have some detailed information for you in the next couple days.



        Gen. Campbell:       Can you give us more information: e.g., more precisely

        they will be returning, how many of them there are, and where they

        reside?



        DL.

         Commissioner

         Alaska Department of Fish and Game

          P.O. Box 115526

         Mike and Mike and Denby and Craig :   the #1 request I got from Alaskan

         troops in Kuwait was for an extension of hunting season - this is their

         second moose / caribou season they have to miss be of the Guard's

         deployment timing. I told them (there aren't that many who'd utilize the

         extention) that I'd do ALL I could to let them fill their freezers this

         year . They return in October and need a few weeks to hunt .       The Bush Ak

         troops - all Natives whom I spoke with - asked for this. I think it's

         perfect and request that this be allowed for them. Rep Nancy Dallstrom

         told me whatever she can do with this request, she'll do. Can this be

         done via Ex or Admin Order? I thought it was an awesome request. Proxy

         hunts possible? Xtention for them to hunt when they return (that's what

         they want to do...).
