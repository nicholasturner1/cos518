        Dear Dr. Lee:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means , and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

       I applaud your recent budget cut decisions. You took a stance to seperate wants from
       needs. Your decision refects intelligent responsible spending. As a 50 year old life long
       Alaskan, I am confident your future decisions will reflect the same amount of intelligent
