        MESSAGE:

        This email was sent to the office of the Commissioner of Fish &amp; Game.rnrnWe are senior
        citizens who have Tier II caribou permits for Unit 13, which we have hunted since 1964.
        This year we are faced with misinformation/interpretation of the rules in the printed
        application and the Hunting regulations book for Tier II. A representative of Fish &amp;
        Game at Glenallen, Mr. Toebe (Tobey?) told the air taxi operator we contacted that he will
        ticket any airplane that flies hunters/meat and that aircraft may not be used on
        navigable waterways, in opposition to the following:rnrnQuoted from the Tier II
        Subsistence Permit Transfer Form and also from the newspaper Tier II applications and the
        hunting regulations distributed to the public:rnrn&quot;Unit 13 Tier II Moose and
        CaribournrnThe use of any off-road vehicle** over 1500 lbs., or any aircraft, for Tier II

         hunting gear, or parts of big game, is prohibited when operated off state-maintained
        roadways and outside of navigable waterways. **Off-road vehicle includes four-wheel drive
        trucks and automobiles, motorcycles, three-to eight-wheeled all-terrain recreation and
        utility vehicles, vehicles with two tracks, air-cushioned vehicles, and
        airboats.)&quot;rnrnln the actual regulations, it says:rnrn(13) the use of any off road
        vehicle over 1,500 pounds, or any aircraft, for moose and caribou hunting under a
        subsistence permit in Unit 13, including the transportation of moose and caribou hunters,
        hunting gear, or parts of big game; however, this provision does not prohibit motorized
        access, or transportation of gear or game, on the Parks Highway, Denali Highway, or
        Richardson Highway.&quot;rnrnalso:rn5AAC 92.004, Policy for off-road vehicle use for

         d utility vehicles, vehicles with two tracks, air-cushioned vehicles, and airboats
         operated outside of a navigable waterway.rnrnWhat we are trying to figure out is whether
         the Glenn Highway is specifically excluded from transporting any Tier II caribou, moose,
         hunters, equipment ALONG ITS TOTAL LENGTH.   Also, the question of &quot;navigable
         waters&quot; needs clarification since we have limited mobility and have flown off various
         lakes to our hunting destination on Clarence Lake. rnrnIn addition, in a section titled
         N13 New changes to Unit 13 moose and caribou; rnrn&quot ;if you obtain a Unit 13 Tier II
         caribou or moose permit , you may not hunt for that species anywhere else in the state
         during the same regulatory year.&quot;rnrnWe would not have applied if not mislead by the
         &quot;navigable waters&quot; information in a number of Alaska Statutes:
         38.05 .965(13);Alaska Const. art. VIII, 3; Ak Sate 11.46.330; Op. AK Atty Gen
         5/17/78.rnrnWe would appreciate a reponse.rnrnKenneth!
