             Aurora Borealis Stamp Release
             Monday, Oct. 1

             It's an honor to help celebrate today's release of the
             Aurora Borealis single stamp from the Polar Lights
             collection. Thank you all - especially Kathy Loera and
             Kathy Phillips - for inviting me to join you!

             We are so blessed to live in this incredible state where we
             get to see the Northern Lights in real life - not just on a
             stamp!

             But I'm delighted to see that Aurora Borealis, a
             phenomenon so closely tied to Alaska, is on a stamp that
             celebrates the tradition of this International Polar Year
             2007-2008.

            This is the fourth time over the past 125 years that
            scientists from around the world are banding together to
            organize scientific and exploration programs concentrated
            in the Polar Regions.

            Each polar year has been a hallmark of international
            cooperation in science achievement - from the first polar

              year in 1882 that included research at Point Barrow - to the
              1932 research that established 40 permanent Arctic research
              stations - to the 1957 research that confirmed continental
              drift and discovered the Van Allen Radiation Belt encircling
              the Earth.

              This Aurora Borealis single stamp was part of the
              International Polar Year souvenir sheet issued jointly on Feb.
              21 by eight countries: the United States, Canada, Denmark,
              Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

              It's also an honor to recognize our postal workers here with
              us and throughout Alaska. You continue the tradition
              established when John H. Kinkead (kin-kade) was named the
              first postmaster general of Alaska - at Sitka in 1867.

             The words on the front of the U.S. Postal Service building in
             New York pretty much describe delivering mail in Alaska -
             "Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays
             these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed
             rounds."

             Congratulations on the issue of this single stamp - and for the
             hard work that you do every day in our challenging
             environment!
