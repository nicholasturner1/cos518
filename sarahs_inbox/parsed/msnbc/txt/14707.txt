             Governor, I haven't heard anything. I will be in the air for the next hour so won't be
             able to listen.



               Sharon, would you please email a summary if you hear anything new.                       Thanks.     Tom

             Anyone know what Fagan is supposedly going to "announce" or "expose" re: TC's
            application? Sharon will monitor his show... We've received word that he's got something
            on TC to announce.
