          Kari's welcome to plug this in to any convenient date that's open this summer. Don't know
          if I want to sponsor the camp be don't know the cost, so just plan on Game Night at the
          ballpark. Looks like the organizer's info is listed here, so it can be confirmed and
          rsvp'd ASAP between Kari and Kris and the Miners. Thanks!

         Greetings, Denise!




         Thanks for your e-mail.




         Kari has quite a balancing act to perform, but I'm sure she'll have an answer for you one
         of these days.




        With a little bit of luck, an opening will appear soon in the Governor's amazingly hectic
        calendar ... and we'll ALL look forward to a Palin family trip to the ballpark and buying
        them some peanuts and Cracker Jack. Although, of course, we DO care that they DO come
        back.

         Hi Kari:




         Is there anyway we can work on a date soon .... I am kind of waiting to schedule the
         Governor Palin Day @ the Park before I finish the rest of the schedule so that we can give
         her as much flexibility as possible . I am available by cell ® 841-4589   or at home
         746-4914 anytime.




                                                              2

         I spoke w/ Denise Christopher w/the Mat - Su Miners this afternoon regarding their upcoming
         season.  They are putting together a "Governor Palin Day at the Park " in June.    I believe
         Rep. Stoltze is involved in this as well .    They've kept several dates open and I suggested
         that she work directly with you on finalizing.




         Also , there ' s a Miners baseball clinic for Valley kids that the Mat - Su Delegation has
         sponsored in the past .    If Governor Palin is interested in sponsoring the clinic it could
         coincide with the "Governor .Palin Day at the Park " game.   The kids get shirts and other
         things that say something like " Mat-Su Miners Baseball Clinic sponsored by Governor
         Palin."




         Denise is copied on this email.
