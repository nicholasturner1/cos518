         If the responses arent ready yet would you send the questions from Rob? I can quickly ask
         Tom, Joe and/or the SAC from DNR (Sadler?) for input. Im on airplane now and may have to
         drop Piper off once I hit Anchorage - so I can work on responses once the questions
         arrive, before my Chamber speech. Thanks!



         I'm asking Kari for Saddler's email addy.

        Governor,




        This is just a heads-up that I will be forwarding to you written responses to the ag
        questions Rob Stapleton presented to us so that you can start reviewing them on the plane
        and then form questions for the ag briefing with Irwin and Rutherford.




        I don't know how late it will come , but I will forward as soon as I can.




        Thanks,

                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0001989
