             Per Greg and Tara Jollie the City of Adak can receive an immediate disbursement of $103,068 as their municipal
             revenue sharing payment if they would just properly adopt their budget in a public meeting.

             Would you suggest a kind letter from Ms. Jollie to the Mayor of Adak reminding him of this fact? If all or part of
             these funds were used to pay the fuel bill, Aleut Corporation may deliver fuel for the city to use again.

             Good morning Randy. Below is information provided by DCRA Director Tara Jollie regarding their revenue
             sharing:

             "The City filed copies of their adopted budget and CFS in order to qualify for their Community Revenue Sharing.
             Upon examination it was noted that they did not follow either their ordinances or state statues in adopting the
             budget ordinance. They introduced it, scheduled a public hearing 3 days later, then adopted it even before the
             public hearing. One of the biggest criticisms of the city is that they do things without informing the public. This
             seems to follow along those lines. Once they properly adopt their annual budget, they would be eligible for
