            Sounds odd, at a time like this with more appropriate oversight of the necessary corrision
            fixes...

           I just received word that personnel with Veco/CH2M Hill that are currently under contract
           with BP and tasked with corrossion prevention work at PBU are going to be laid off--more
           than 100 people. An announcement is expected to be made tomorrow and the personnel
           informed.   The reason as it was explained to me is that there are safety concerns with
           winter work.   Sorry I don't have more details, but this was passed on to me third-hand
           just a few minutes ago.
