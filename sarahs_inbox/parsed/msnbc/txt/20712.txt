              Congratulations Governor - if I may be bold ... a number of your support staff here in Juneau gathered to watch
              your speech and we couldn 't be more excited. We thought your speech was absolutely excellent!!

              Just wanted to pass that along and wish you best of luck - I'm going back to school this semester probably my
              only chance to say congratulations before I depart . It has been a pleasure working for you!!

              Thanks,
              Lauren
