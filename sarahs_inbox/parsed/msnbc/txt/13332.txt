            Congradulations to you and your family on your little blessing from GOD. It is a blessing
            to see parents acknowledge children with DOWNS as a blessing from GOD. My husband and I
            are Godparents to our little angle Kandice, Whom we say has UPS because she brings such
            joy and abounding love to our lives. I Congradulate your family and wish you all the
            exciting adventures you will experience with your new bundle of pure angel. Enjoy and God
            Bless you all.
