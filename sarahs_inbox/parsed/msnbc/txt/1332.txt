Thank you! And absolutely we'd be honored to see your hubby - Piper will be so pleased to know you
thought of her. I'll let Janice and Kris know that we'll be looking for him.



Thanks for the "congrats". Trig is awesome!

Hi,

Our class has made a book for Piper to welcome her new baby brother.

My husband will be in Anchorage tomorrow and Saturday. Evidently his

Anchorage office is on the same floor as your office so it would be

easy for him to bring the book by.

I originally thought he could give it to you at the Capstone bill

signing on Saturday but he thinks that may be too hectic.



And, a big congratulations to your family on Trig's arrival. Of

course he will bring joy to all of you, and you to him.



Give Piper a hug from me.



Patty Winegar
