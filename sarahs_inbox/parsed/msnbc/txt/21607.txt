              I read with great interest the Newsweek piece on Women and leadership (October 16 2007).
              All very positive and encouraging for women. Except the terrible picture of you walking
              across a road reading your text messages,  with your daughter trailing along behind you,
              out of your view. Your phone is clearly more important than your daughter.    Hope the Red
              Bull made you feel more energetic. What an awful image of mothering.
