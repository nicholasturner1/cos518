             Governor:



             Commissioner Galvin did talk with Jim Bowles today to follow up on the discussion from
             yesterday.  Bowles did report that their Juneau people were getting questions from
             legislators about how the meeting went. They are discouraged that anyone would know about
             the meeting or the details of the conversation. He went so far as to say that if we went
             public with those details, we would not like how they had to respond.

             in case he asks: Bill McAllister asked why, after all our mtgs with CP (even discussing
             their "Plan" yesterday for four hours), we still don't know what they're asking for - in
             terms of fiscal certainty. I told him we still don't know tax rate request, but the 20-25
             year tax lock-up has been discussed publicly by CP, but I'm sure not convinced of the need
             or Constitionality of locking up any longer than the decade we discussed early in AGIA
             debate.



             I said it sounded like the AK CP officials had to speak with Mulva this week - maybe after
             their meetings Outside we'd hear more about their "Plan"... and we continue to fulfill our
                                                                 2

              committment to not dismiss any ideas on how to commercialize our gas - but we're committed
              to AGIA and there's no need to stray from it today.
