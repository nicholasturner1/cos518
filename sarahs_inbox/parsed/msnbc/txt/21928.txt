                 Dear Governor Palin:

                 Just wanted to send you a picture of my Halloween costume, in which I dressed up as you. I
                 have attached two pictures of my outfit. I hope you at least get a quick laugh out of these.

                 Thanks you for your time.

                 Take care and God bless,
                 Sandy Empson
