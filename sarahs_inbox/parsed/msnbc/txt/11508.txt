            Eni had a public release on it yesterday. I will forward it to LG.

            They announced yesterday their $1.5 billion, is my understanding. Tom/Marty, et al: is
            this already a public announcement?

           On another speech related note--the ADN has an article about how BP has reduced its
           spending plan for Alaska, will ENI's announcement come soon? I've only heard it's in the
           works, not when they'll make it. (Obviously, I won't talk about it in the FAI Chamber
           speech unless it's announced.)
