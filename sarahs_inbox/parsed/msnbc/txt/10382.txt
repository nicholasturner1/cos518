                    Hello Governor and Todd,

                    Just a quick plumbing update:

                    Everything works in the House except for the two items in Piper 's bathroom and the laundry sink in the basement
                    There's more information at the bottom of this email.

                    I have been very impressed with both of the contractors on this project- they're good , hardworkers!!

                    Look forward to seeing everyone!!
                    Erika
