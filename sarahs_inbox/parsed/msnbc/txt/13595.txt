            Thank you.

            Rosanne and Sharon: it's going to be important for us to message the "huge growth of
           admin's operating budget" spin that leggies are running with (being used to deflect their
           huge growth in capital budget), so pis be thinking along those lines before they gavel
           out. Thanks
