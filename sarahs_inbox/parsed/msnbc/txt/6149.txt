         Pls move mike felix's mtg to later in the day on thurs as I won't be in Anchorage that
         many hrs if I'm attending the evening fundraiser that doesn't begin until 8pm in
         anchorage. (Remember it's an easy hour drive back home after those anchorage evening
         events)

         Governor - Update on the Dare to Care Fashion Event for Thursday, 07.12 @ 7:30 p.m. @
         Nordstroms.




         I spoke with Bonnie Faulk's niece - Bettsie Wild. This is a Charity Event that will
         benefit many kids in the community. Bettsie would love your presence and also the
         presence of your daughters. It will just be a relaxing event for you to watch. Bettsie
         did say that they would be doing several door prize drawings and would love to have you
         pull the names if you would like.



         Please let me.know how many will be attending so that she can have seats for you all.



         Thanks, Janice
