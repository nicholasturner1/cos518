         Joe and Mike have set up a briefing with House majority and minority members for next
         Tuesday at 10:30 in Anchorage. It was coordinated with Speaker Harris and Beth Kerttula.



         Based on my current understanding , it will be primarily a quick run through of the process
         we went through, the options we looked at , the type of analysis we did, and our
         conclusions . We'll answer general questions , and offer more in-depth briefings for
         smaller groups in the following weeks.



          -Pat

         Heard there's a Tuesday House hearing on ACES. Senate Minority waiting to see if Senate
         Majority going to ask for a similar briefing. If the silence fr Senate Majority remains
         deafening, Senate Minority might ask for same hearing or q and a opportunity House has.

           Senate Minority generally favorable but individual members are going to wait on the
          "details" of ACES before going all in.
