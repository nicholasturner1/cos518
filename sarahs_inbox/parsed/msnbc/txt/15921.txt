          Dear governor palin.  In regard to the ACLU letter in the anchorage daily news against
          my joining Utah and other AGs against same sex marriage being started in California
          before their voters vote the ACLU is behind as the California supreme court chose to
          ignore the ag letter and proceed to have same sex marriage in California. . The matter is
          over.  Talis.

           Can't open but thank u for writing this- Tom can not subject himself to their line of
          questioning, as legislators no doubt know.
