          This sounds good - I just can't do it during Iron Dog week ,                which is usually

          Mid-February... and we have a Nat'l Gov's Washington, DC mtg with the President towards
          the end of February.



          I'd love to squeeze in the west coast leadership conf!

          Governor:



          Newsweek magazine is planning an inaugural West Coast Women in Leadership conference in
          February 2008-- similar to the one you'll be participating in tomorrow.



          They are inviting you and Gov. Napolitano to be keynote speakers in the area of politics.



         AND they would like to make the announcement during the conference tomorrow. Right now,
         all you would need to answer is yes to attending the conference.



         Newsweek staff will work with scheduling to select suitable dates. They would also handle
         all details -- our only commitment would be your availability to speak.



         If you'd like to discuss this, you can give me a call in my room 1406.



         Beth
