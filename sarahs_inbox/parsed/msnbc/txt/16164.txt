             Governor - I received an email from Commissioner Kreitzer who said that she spoke with you
             yesterday, Monday, 06.16 regarding a 30 minute presentation that she would like to show
             you along with her ETS folks regarding a software program. Mike has seen some of the
             presentation and has some questions that have not been answered . The recommendation is
             that the Commissioner do the presentation with the COS and Anna Kim. At that point a
             briefing paper can be done and presented to you with the pros and cons of the program. I
             do not think you need to sit down with this presentation at this point.
