          The letter needs to very concisely state that I am repsectfully requesting her to share
          "her plan" to get both bills on the floor so we don't waste her valuable time while in
          Juneau. She needs to share more than just her idea to this time go around Judiciary, as
          she stated-quote- "Hollis has no power." (That was her "plan" last time I spoke to her)

            Has a response letter gone out to lyda's May 23 letter?

           If not, pls craft one acknowledging receipt of it, and explaining we need to hear what
          her plan is to get both bills to the Senate floor. It can be short and sweet... Then she
          can't clobber us for not responding.
