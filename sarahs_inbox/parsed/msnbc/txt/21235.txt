            Governor,

            CACFA -
            After 7 days we've been unable to reach Nrivueged of privilege for the final spot on CACFA. He must be out of
            town. Todd provided the name of Native Alaskan Frank Woods this morning whom I spoke to. His background:
            He's on DNR's Snow Track Committee, the Federal Subsistence Advisory Council, and the Native American Fish
            & Wildlife Society. He had some DUI issues over 23yrs ago but no issues recently. If he sounds good to you, our
            final panel would be:
            Susan Smith - Chitina - of "Residents of the Wrangell"
            Ken Kreitzer - Juneau - all-around outdoorsman
            Mark Fish - Anchorage - hunter's/outdoor right's advocate
            Charlie Lean - Nome - local expert on federal land issues

            Committee

            Pacific Salmon Commission Northern Panel -
           Provides technical & regulatory advise for the Pacific Salmon Commission.
           Unanimous consensus through Cora, Denby & Nizich is that this covers meaty and historical issues in our
           negotiations with Canada on Salmon. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

            Let me know if you're comfortable moving forward with these three. That'll knock off another 9.
