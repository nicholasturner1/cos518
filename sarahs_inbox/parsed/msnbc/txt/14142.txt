            I'll do it- pls let me know what the status of many of these issues would be. I'm asking
            Frank and ivy to run them down for me also because they're very passionate about getting
            things done this final week of session. I am asking them to assist, as the call went out
            to commissioners last week to also assist in pressuring lawmakers to do the right thing
            and progress bills and budgets. It's my decision to request their assistance.

            won't get done etc. This seems like a perfect opportunity to talk about Stedman holding
            bills, the predator control bill and lack of movement on the CON. Thoughts?
