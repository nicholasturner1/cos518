           Governor - We can put off the Sen. Stevens meeting to another day this week. I just
           called his office and he would like to meet on his Vetoed Projects especially the $4
           Million Kodiak School. I will then drop the Appropriations Meeting to 4:00 p.m. to give
           you breathing room.  That will be all for Tuesday. Thanks, Janice

           Looks pretty packed. I prefer having a minute or two to get there to the house, get my
           bearings (especially with Trig) and shift gears instead of going from the plane
           immediately into meetings. I had not counted on immediately meeting. What is Stevens'
           issue - don't plan on mtg without knowing what his beef is first
