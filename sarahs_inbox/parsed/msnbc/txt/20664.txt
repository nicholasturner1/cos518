               Governor,

               Mike approved of your message with one word change -support the needs of your fellow Alaskans" instead of
               "meet the needs of your fellow Alaskans."
               Okay to send out on Friday?

               A Labor Day Message from Governor Sarah Palin

               and celebrate your achievements and dedication , and we thank you for all you do to support the needs of your
