          Thank you for going through another 1,000 for us! See you in the morning - i've got a
          doctor's appointment and will be in closer to 9. Sorry about that.

         I've got the emails cleared out and we're at about 28,000.



         Polar Bear: 23%

         Dog Musher: 38%

         Grizzly: 31%

         Gold Panner: 8%



         The votes have increased but the results have tracked consistently.

         We'll do a final tally in the morning. To maintain the element of

         surprise and excitement, we're keeping this under wraps.



         Kris
