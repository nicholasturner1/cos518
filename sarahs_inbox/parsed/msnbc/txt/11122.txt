                Ma'am -
                We look forward to your trip down for graduation next week. The FT Benning Protocol office is
                spinning up as it not often the son of an elected official graduates from "grunt" school. Protocol
                people are the ones that handle making proper arrangements to ensure we Army folk don't make
                ourselves look stupid, kind of like Ms Manners-types. I didn't know they existed until the other
                day. I'm sure over the next few days there will be more questions, but I figured I would use our
                direct line of communication to try and get a few of the ones I have now answered. Otherwise,
                Track will be calling 2-3 times a day as these questions come rolling in.

                Protocol welcomes your family to stay in one of the Distinguished Visitor quarters on FT
                Benning, it's called the Marshall House, named after GEN George Marshall. I believe there is 3-
                4 bedrooms. Unless you are partial to your current lodging plans, I'd recommend it, I hear it's
                nice. It's the same type of housing that our high ranking officers live in while stationed here.
                Second, protocol mentioned getting you a car pass that will allow you to come and go through
                the gates without going through the standard identification and search procedures. And the last
                question is are you flying into Atlanta or Columbus?

                If you have someone on your staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that person's
                name and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if you'd prefer.

                One final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on Thursday is being pushed
                back. Family Brief is going to be held at 12:00 and Turning Blue at 1:00pm.

                Respectfully,

                 Disregard what I said about the car service. What they can do is get you a special pass so your vehicle
                 can go through checkpoints like a military vehicle and bypass the extra security measures for non-
                 military stickered vehicles.

                 lodging plans, I'd recommend it, I hear it's nice. It's the same type of housing that our high ranking
                 officers live in while stationed here. Second, protocol mentioned something about a car service. I'm not
                 sure if that means you'd just get a car, or they would have someone drive you around. Let me know if
                 you are interested, at the very least, it will make parking easier. And the last question is are you flying
                 into Atlanta or Columbus?

                 If Mrs. Palin has someone on her staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that person's name
                 and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if you'd prefer.

                 One final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on. Thursday is being pushed back.
                 Family Brief is going to be held at 12:00 and Turning Blue at 1:00pm.

                 -----Inline Attachment Follows-----

                 Sir -
                 We look forward to your trip down for graduation next week. The FT Benning Protocol office is
                 spinning up as it not often the son of an elected official graduates from "grunt" school. Protocol people
                 are the ones that handle making proper arrangements to ensure we Army folk don't make ourselves look
                 stupid, kind of like Ms Manners-types. I didn't know they existed until yesterday. I'm sure over the next
                 few days there will be more questions, but I figured I would use our direct line of communication to try
                 and get a few of the ones I have now answered. Otherwise, Track will be calling 2-3 times a day as
                 these questions come rolling in.

                 Protocol welcomes your family to stay in one of the Distinguished Visitor quarters on FT Benning, it's
                 called the Marshall House, named after GEN George Marshall. Unless you are partial to your current
                 lodging plans, I'd recommend it, I hear it's nice. It's the same type of housing that our high ranking
                 officers live in while stationed here. Second, protocol mentioned something about a car service. I'm not
                 sure if that means you'd just get a car, or they would have someone drive you around. Let me know if
                 you are interested, at the very least, it will make parking easier. And the last question is are you flying
                 into Atlanta or Columbus?

                 If Mrs . Palin has someone on her staff that handles these things for you, I can pass that person's name
                 and contact information along and Protocol can work with them directly if you'd prefer.

                 One final note, our Family Day brief and Turning Blue ceremony on Thursday is being pushed back.
