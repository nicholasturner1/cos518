                Governor Palin and Mike,

                My hard copies go back to 1995 and there has never been in a woman in that time . I've called Admin Services to
                see if they can look back farther.

                Ivy - has there ever been a woman on the RR board before?

                Tib - thinking out loud: possible scenerios:
