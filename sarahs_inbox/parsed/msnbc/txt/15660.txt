             Governor,



              I forgot to mention that the bill signing is taking place on a patch of gravel - I only
             mention it because you might do well to wear a sturdier heel for better footing. I'll work
             to include these details in your briefing book from now on in order to avoid extra emails
             for you:)



              Kate
