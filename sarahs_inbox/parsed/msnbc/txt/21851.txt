                 Subject: Kate and Right to Life Speech

               Hi,
               I haven't mentioned this to Kate yet as I wanted to get some direction from you first. Kate was
               under the impression that you wanted her to write comments for your (and my) Right to Life
               Banquet appearance around November 24th. As I understand it, Beth has already drafted your
               comments, obtained the AG's input , etc. [I've been talking solely with Talis.] Seems like I need
               to take Kate off the project at this point but I wondered if you had other designs in mind before
               I talk with her???
