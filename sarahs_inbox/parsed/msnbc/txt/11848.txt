           Governor,



           We'll have the House ready for Tuesday with tv screens, food and the works!



           Sorry that there's the issue of OT and burdening the staff; this is traditionally the
           "busy" time of the year for us and receptions, meetings, lunches, dinners,
           coffee/desserts, etc... are what we expect to take place at the House. That's just part
           of our job; we're always happy and available to come in- the House is here to provide
           these services for the Governor. With that said, we'll have everything ready to go for
           tomorrow night!!  IF you change your mind just call me- I'm 3 minutes away!! :)



           Thanks,

           Erika

           Erika- I don't anticipate needing anyone to staff tomorrow's super tuesday event be as
           long as we've got tvs set up and food available I can keep the table stocked - we don't
           know how many folks will stop by and I don't want the third floor to make any big deal out
           of me inviting people to the house... it seems like they interpret it as a big deal if
           they think staff will be called in for OT or it'll be a burden on staff... So, I think Ivy
           and I can handle folks stopping by. Ivy- how many do you think?
