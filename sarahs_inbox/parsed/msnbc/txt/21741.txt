              Subject:                Cert of Need and Educ Funding plan


              Mike: I'd like to begin work on allowing flexibility in CoN for leggies to start
              considering - when does the task force wrap up?



             Also- that's a lot of nerve of Begich to say he's going to sue over Educ funding when
             Carol Comeau doesn't even agree with him. We need to respond with Barbara's and Eddy's
             idea on the three-year, three-legged stool idea. We're going to look reactionary if we
             wait too long to let the public know our educ funding plans, so pls let Eddy know I'd like
             something on the plan to be made public asap. Thanks
