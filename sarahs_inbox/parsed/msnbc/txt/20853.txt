              Lieutenant David C . Tugmon

             You asked me to fill out a request for a report that everyone has reused to give me information on.
             1. I started filed a complaint
             2. I do not have a case number because Shanigan refused to give me one.
             3. I've mailed request by email , certified mail and , no one will assist me.

             Offer Shanigan contacted me at Wildwood around 6/07/07 and 6/8/08.

             I know why everyone doesn 't want me to have the report The question is do you want to be a part of the cover ,
             up?
             AS11 . 16.110, AS1156.770 and AS1 1 .56.780 one of these may apply in this case to the Officer involved in this
             matter?

             Now you ask me to fill out a request from without information IE Case Number and questions that would be
             answered by reading the report.
             So I believe this is just another stall tactic . Because you are asking question I can 't answer.
             So what would you have me do?

              Per Greg and Tara Jollie the City of Adak can receive an immediate disbursement of $103, 068 as their municipal
              revenue sharing payment if they would just properly adopt their budget in a public meeting.

              Would you suggest a kind letter from Ms. Jollie to the Mayor of Adak reminding him of this fact? If all or part of
              these funds were used to pay the fuel bill, Aleut Corporation may deliver fuel for the city to use again.

             Good morning Randy . Below is information provided by DCRA Director Tara Jollie regarding their revenue
             sharing:

              The City filed copies of their adopted budget and CFS in order to qualify for their Community Revenue Sharing.
             Upon examination it was noted that they did not follow either their ordinances or state statues in adopting the
             budget ordinance. They introduced it, scheduled a public hearing 3 days later, then adopted it even before the
             public hearing. One of the biggest criticisms of the city is that they do things without informing the public. This
             seems to follow along those lines. Once they properly adopt their annual budget, they would be eligible for
