         Governor,



         Sorry I was rushing out the door for K's Open House..



         I'd be willing to use up stuff (3jars of sauce & pkg. of noodles, etc) that we have at the
         House and just buy some extra spagh. sauce and noodles at Costco and do a low budget
         dinner for Colony. I'd donate the sauce and noodles if we just wanted to stay away from
         adding extra costs; might be able to get a donated container of a drink from
         McDonalds ... and use up leftover reception food and we have a box of mic. popcorn plus
         brownies.



         I really don't want to try to push anything on you, just ideas.



         Erika

        Erika - huge issues seem to have erupted on the visiting football team on Friday. This
        "controversy" stems from the perception that I'd be favoring a visiting team from the
        Valley over the local Juneau team, and that "parents are sensitive to this, they may write
        letters to the editor", etc.



        What a crock.



        We've hosted so many groups, classrooms, teams, etc in the mansion and/or the Juneau
        office and no one has said boo about it.


                                                                 1

         There's questions about who ' d pay for what ( food-wise ) if the visiting team came over.
         It's obvious the question is being asked because this is a visiting team, and not Juneau
         ( tho I was anxious to have the Juneau visit too). I am sickened by this controversy.



         A budget meeting where Perez and Rehfeld brought this up? These type of issues , obviously,
         were never dealt with by Knowles and Murkowski - I am sickened by this and Erika and I
         were excited to get to invite more Alaskan kids to see THEIR mansion , not ours.



         So as to not disappoint the team, but to not get me, my administration or Erika in
         trouble, no food will be served unless the team brings it themselves ... sounds like the
         controversy was also over " the State can't pay for the food since there isn ' t an in-house
         chef anymore "... So no food.



         Add to the solutions '     list Mike ,   Erika ,   etc so we can conclude this issue before it gets
         even uglier.



         Again ,   I am heartsick that anyone perceived this a negative thing.
