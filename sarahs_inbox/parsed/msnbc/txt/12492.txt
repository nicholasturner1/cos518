                Subject: Dennis Hardy - Marine Highway

              Governor,
              DOT will be sending a release today announcing the resignation of Dennis Hardy . Leo will send me a draft before
              it goes out but I expect it will be very brief. We are also planning on touching base personally with several coastal
              legislators . If asked about a replacement, I plan on passing along a comment that the House Finance Committee
              has eliminated the De         Commissioner 12osition so there is uncertain on how we will proceed. I would also
              like to oars along that , Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
