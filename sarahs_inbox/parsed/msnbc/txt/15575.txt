            Yes, I agree for that to be mentioned. We need this message as soon as possible as
            lawmakers are all gathered together over these next few days.

            If possible we need to include something on how the huge Ed funding should've alleviated
            the need for all of these individual tiny projects to get funded. I hear over and over
            that the jam up in distribution is at the District level here in Anch, the inequities, etc
            in how funds ae distributed within district.

            K- pls draft a letter-to-editor (225 words max) summarizing budget.        Unless someone's done
            the op-ed already...

            We really need to message this right (hopefully it's not too late to do so) re: "cuts" in
            so many cases were not CUTS to exisiting levels of operating funds, they were reductions
            in the increased requests by lawmakers.



            Also, the letter needs to explain our desire for balance along with the other principles
            we used to prioritize.



            Also to remind pers/trs relief, increased muni shares, huge savings. Aill those things
            were lost in mainstream media coverage of.our budget.



            A sentence in there must explain we have just allocated the largest amount of money, ever
            in state's history, for education (and still it's bickered about that it's not enough, so
            says a mayor or official or two)!
