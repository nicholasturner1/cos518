               Huh? Is he writing a story on the First Family's invitation to attend a native celebration? The
               state only bought one, one-way ticket for only one other member of the First Family (only the
               return flt), as not all 7 of us attended, of course.
               When we're invited to a family event I do road trips when possible, but Barrow aint a road trip.
               They were thrilled at least Piper could make it out of the first family members.
               And we didn't even spend the night so no hotel!
               And my travel is 1/4 what Murk' s was, despite having a large family that's always invited to all
               these Alaskan first family events.

               Governor -

               Just an FYI. I talked with Kyle Hopkins at length about First Family travel. He specifically
               asked about the Barrow trip and why the state should pay for Piper's travel expenses. I
               explained at length that there is a certain obligation and expectation of the First Family to
               participate in community activities and make public appearances. He said / will say that I
               could not give a specific regulation that spells out First Family travel guidelines. I told him
               that it is unfair to ask me for a specific regulation - after hours - before a holiday and if
               necessary, I would call Nizich or Linda at home. He said that was walking out the door and
               he would let his editors know of my concerns . I insisted that he - attribute to me, that a
               regulation exists.
               Hopefully, I will portrayed accurately in the paper tomorrow . Thanks.
