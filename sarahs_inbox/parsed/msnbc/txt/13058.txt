             Dear Merica:
             To follow up our phone conversation this afternoon , I would like to request that you send me an email explaining
             your concerns. Due to the Governor's demanding schedule, especially during legislative session , it has been
             difficult to schedule a time for you to speak with her. By sending a detailed email including the subject matter, we
             can be sure that your concerns are properly addressed.

             I also understand that you tried to approach the Governor last weekend during the Republican Convention but
             were not able to discuss your concerns . Please keep in mind that the Governor has a very tight schedule and
             had many engagements to attend to while in Anchorage . I apologize if there were any misunderstandings.

             With all respect,

            Hannah Buck
            Scheduling Assistant

                      Re: Department of Fish and Game funding proposal # 44823 now in SB 256 and HB 311
                      for the purchase of the Trujillo property on the Kasilof River.

                      Honorable Governor Palin,

                      Just over 3 weeks ago my neighborhood found out by accident the Department of Fish
                      and Game was again trying to get funding to buy the Trujillo property for a public access
                      power boat launch. The access to this boat ramp would be through my neighborhood.
                      Hopefully you have had a chance to view our correspondence to the State regarding this
                      project.

                      As far as we know the State has had no public input on the effects of this project on the
                      river, the commercial fishing industry , critical habitat, or the local residents . There is a
                      big push to buy Trujillos when it is not even known if it is an acceptable site for a power
                      boat launch. The Swanson property is also being considered for this boat launch but we
                      have found no funding proposal to buy it too. Why would the State buy one but not the
                      other before the site assessment is completed?

                      When my neighborhood first began the fight against this power boat launch at Trujillos I
                      just wanted it to be somewhere else on the river. In these few weeks I have thought about
                      it a lot and have come to the realization that I do not want another public access power
                      boat launch any where on the Kasilof River. The Kenai River has so many problems now
                      because of the high numbers of power boats. The Kasilof is a much smaller river and I
                      believe it will be devastated if large numbers of power boats come here, and they will if
                      the State provides easy access to the lower river.

                      Last year you vetoed this project. If this funding proposal makes it through the Senate
                      and House process this year I urge you to reject it again.

                      Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration of this issue.

                                                               Sincerely,
