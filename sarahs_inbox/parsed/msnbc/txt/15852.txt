          Message:I was sad to see that the money for turf in Palmer was not put in the budget if I
          heard right. The small town of palmer dosen't have much for the kids so a field where they
          could play soccer and football would have been great don't get me wrong I am not complaing
          I think you are the best thing that has happened to Alaska I just think that it would have
          helped the kids in the valley thanks for taking the time to read this and keep up the good
          work take care of you and yours the Daniels love ya
