                 Yesterday I met with Larry Stinson w/Alaska Medical Centers. He provided me with a stack of reading material
                 regarding their position for CON repeal or modification, further stating that it promotes healthy competition, drops
                 healthcare costs to the consumer, will help with PERSITRS and does not affect hospital profits. In addition, he
                 spoke of forgiven loans and an extra [$72 million] distribution to hospitals for indigent care relief under the
                 Murkowski administration.

                 Mike & John, I'll send you copies.

                 Governor, he referenced your State of the State speech and mention of a Healthcare Advisory Council. He would
                 be honored to assist in any way and recommends that there be at least two physicians in private practice
                 participating.
