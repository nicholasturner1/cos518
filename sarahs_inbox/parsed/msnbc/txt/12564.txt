                 Subject: Working Group Report and legislation

               Governor:
               Just an update - the legislation implementing a portion of the Working Group
               recommendations (tying salaries for non-union personnel to the SU contract terms)
               has been delivered to the Legislature for introduction. I understand Mike briefed you
               on the contents of the bill earlier today.
               We concurrently are rolling out the Working Group Report with caveats that the work
               is ongoing and that not all recommendations will necessarily be implemented.
               I am signing the well baby coverage on Monday with Senators McGuire and French
               invited.
               PSEA contract - we're getting closer. They will be in Juneau next week, so I expect
               we won't come to conclusion today. I expect they'll want to be in JNU to visit with
               legislators. I briefed Mike on some of the non-monetary portions of the contract that
               I'm committed to getting.
