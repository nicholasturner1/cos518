           Subject : Maritime Union negotiations




           Governor:



           I spoke with Mike T . this morning and he thought I should give you this heads up.



           You'll remember in Cabinet meetings , I've mentioned how tough I anticipated these
           negotiations with the maritime unions to be. The Inland Boatman's Union ( IBU) turned down
           a 1-year extension which included a 3% pay increase apparently due to not receiving
           $11/month/ employee toward health benefits . The other two unions ( MEBA & MM&P ) did accept
           the one-year rollover.



           We are now in negotiations with all three maritime unions and today I am putting on the
           table some pretty ugly counter offers .    Ferry system employees get free passes , ostensibly
           on a "space available " basis .  This just seems unconscionable when the system is projected
           to run a $90 million deficit for FY09 .    Commissioner von Scheben and I are working closely
           together to achieve savings in these contracts .     Here is a link to a JNU Empire story
           which ran today , where von Scheben outlines difficulties with funding:
           http://www.juneauempire . com/stories /101107/ sta_20071011013.shtml




           There will be negative press about our negotiations .   However , we will not be able to hold
           the line on spending if we don ' t go in tough here . I am planning on meeting with
           Southeast legislators October 18 and 19 when they are here for Special Session. Ivy is
           gathering the names of the Southeast Mayors so that I can start talking with them as well.
                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0006482

                 I also plan to meet with Cathie Roemmich of the MTAB.



            I think it will be Juneau ' s delegation that will scream the loudest, but I don't know.



            Please let me know if you want or need additional information right now.
