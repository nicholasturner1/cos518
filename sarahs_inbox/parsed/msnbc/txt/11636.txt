               Governor,
               Attached Is a spreadsheet of all vacant exempt or partially exempt positions . Thought this could be useful for you
               to have. You'll notice under Office of the Governor it says there 's a vacant deputy chief of staff position . This is
               because Cheryl Frasca and Nizich served as deputies under Murkowski . Nizich fills a temporary position , Frasca
               filled the permanent position . Also vacant but not on this list, the press secretary and communications assistant
               positions because they are so recently vacated.
