           Thank you Tom- I've been praying for wisdom also on this- I am so glad to know you join me
           in this- God will have to show me what to do on the people's budget because I don't yet
           know the right path... He will show me though. Thank you and God bless your day today!

           Governor,  just wanted to encourage you on the budget and let you know I have prayed in
           Jesus name for you to have wisdom and discernment and that God would bless you and your
           family.     Tom
