            Governor - Good thing you and girls got out last night. The wind and snow are terrible
            today.




            Commissioner Lloyd had emailed a request earlier today to see if you would like to do a
            stop by at the Board of Fish meeting next door to the Millennium - apparently they are
            there until approx. 5:00 p.m. The Commissioner also asked if you would like any
            assistance at the banquet tonight.




            You may not even be in ANC until after 5:00 p.m. tonight but I told him I would check.
            Thanks, Janice
