           While in Skagway you guys might run into Mayor Tim Bourcy and others who are interested in the make up of
           MTAB. The city is endorsing Mike Korsmo who is on the city council . Bourcy has been outspoken against the
           Juneau road project. Korsmo has a long history with former Governor Knowles . Both were at the MTAB press
           conference. Both are advocating for a Skagway seat , rather than a Haines seat . Just a heads up so you guys
           aren 't caught off guard.
