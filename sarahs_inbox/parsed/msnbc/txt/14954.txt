                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                           No. 08-071



                Governor Palin Responds to Record Oil Prices



                May 7, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement as the price of
                Alaska North Slope crude oil reached a record level of $123.53 a barrel.



                "Alaskans are feeling the pinch of high energy costs. The state treasury is swelling while the family
                checkbook is evaporating. As prices continue to rise, we cannot wait for medium- and long-term solutions
                to come into place."



                Each month the price of Alaska crude oil remains over $120 a barrel, the state treasury will take in
                approximately $650 million more than what was forecasted just last month.



                "Since coming into office, we have been taking a methodical approach to long-teen solutions that will
                move Alaska' s communities off of expensive diesel to cleaner and cheaper alternatives. With today's
                prices, we don't have the luxury of time. Alaska' s families, communities and businesses are hurting and
                we need relief now."

                When Governor Palin appointed Steve Haagenson as energy coordinator, she directed him to lead a team to
                identify the most efficient and effective ways to reduce the energy cost burden on Alaskans . The Governor
                will unveil the plan to address the short-term energy crisis caused by spiking oil prices in the next week.
