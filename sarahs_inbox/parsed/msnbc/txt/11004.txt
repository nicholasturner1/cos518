              The permitting and energy mtg(s) will go longer than half an hour - I need to go thru many
              things with energy team. I'm setting aside two hrs for it. Tibbles' mtg can take place
              after that so I don't have to wait for a sunday mtg to go over bills. Thanks

              Governor - I have confirmed the 10:00 a.m. appointment w/Lt. Gov, etc. on permitting for
              Friday, 01.11.08.  Mike Tibbles said that he had talked with you about a teleconference
              call on Friday for 30 minutes on the Bill List. May we set that up for 9:30 -10:00 a.m.
              so that you are still able to leave the office by 10:30 a.m. for the Valley? Another
              option suggested was going over the Bill List on Sunday here in Juneau.




              Also, the KING AIR is available on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. for transport to JNU. We have
              you, willow and Piper listed. Thanks, Janice
