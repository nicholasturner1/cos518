         What is the issue? I'll email them to ask so I have any amt of info I can get before any
         mtg. I don't want to waste their time if I'm not prepared for whatever issue they're
         working on.

        Spoke w/Pat Galvin again. He and Tom are hoping to meet w/you briefly tomorrow and dial
        Marty in (she'll be out-of-state). FYI, I suggested Mike Tibbles as well to speak with.



        I told Pat I'd follow back up w/him in the morning.
