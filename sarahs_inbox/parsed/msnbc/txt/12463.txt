           MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor,



           I hope that Senator McCain will be astute enough to consider you for Vice-President this
           fall.  If so, I do hope that you will decide in favor of all of the conservatives in
           America who are longing for a strong advocate. God bless you and your family and all of
           your endeavors.  Thanks for listening.
