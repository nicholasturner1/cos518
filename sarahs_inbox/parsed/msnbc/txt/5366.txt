                 right 'o!

                 thanks!

                 and great idea about Britta being a page for a day.

                   Well have Stoltze give a tour... he could even introduce them on the floor. If Pastor Hanson
                   really wants her to get involved she could be a guest page for a day : )

                   The glacier is cool, driving out to the end of the road is pretty scenic. You're right, the
                   snowboarding is a must. State museum, Shrine of St Therese, Temsco helicopter tour. They'll
                   have fun.

                   Hi IV:

                   Track and one or two of his friends will be spending their spring break here - March 12-
                   16.

                  I'll hook 'em up with snowboarding and the AK Club... can you hook 'em up with the
                  Legislative Tour like you did with my parents? That was good.

                  Track and Britta (and maybe Track's buddy Jack) would get something out of the
                  historical/governmental activities here. I think. They could sit in the gallery and watch
                  sausage being made.

                  Britta's parents (Pastor Duane Hanson from Good Shephard in Wasilla) want her to
                  absorb some of the Legislative process here.

                  Thanks so much!
