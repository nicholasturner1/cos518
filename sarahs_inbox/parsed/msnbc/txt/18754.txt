         Governor,



         I just talked to Steve and provided him additional background information. He said that
         so far, he has been unable to reach Lyda. I let him know that I spoke with Lyda and made
         offers in numerous formats to help provide the Legislature information on our proposal,
                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01 0005074

          how we came to that decision and why we think it is best for Alaska. I also told him that
          since there was not much interest, I requested the assistance of other members of
          leadership to schedule meetings before and during special session so we could speed up the
          educational process and help have a more successful session. I also offered to a number
          of other leadership members our willingness to sit down and walk them through additional
          information .  Some are individually interested.  I let him know that in addition to my
          calls , Russ had been in contact with Lyda. He was very thankful for the information.



          Mike
