              Do you have a recommendation for the tone I take with these constituents regarding the
              Kenai regs?



              I have a pile of phone calls and emails to respond to, and I'm not sure what you want me
              to say.

              Boss : do you know Mel, from Kenai? He called and wanted a call from you, but if you don't
              know him, I'll call him. Guessing its 50 HP related.
