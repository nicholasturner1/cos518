                 appreciation for the work of Senate Judiciary in moving ACES from committee.

                 "I am pleased to see the Senate Judiciary Committee work together in a cooperative
                 manner to produce a solution that is reasonable and consistent with the principals we
                 incorporated into ACES," Governor Palin said. "I hope all Alaskans will join me In
                 applauding the efforts of these legislators. I am particularly happy that the Senate
                 Committee included the 25 percent tax rate to ensure Alaska gets an equitable share of our
                 resources. I am also pleased they added language to reflect their commitment to save our
                 surplus for the future."

                The ACES bill Is now headed to the Senate Finance Committee.
