            I'll attend the Spartan exercise May 16.



            I'll do press conf for 1:30 print signing May 9 (can it be moved to 1:00 instead?), and
           I'll assume it's over in time for me to zip over to quick ceremony at 2:30 for police
           memorial.

           Governor - Your calendar shows the Speech for the Alaskan Police Memorial Ceremony in ANC.
             This was an invitation that we received from Comm. Schmidt and Comm. Monegan. They are
           requesting Governor or a designee to attend and give brief remarks during the memorial
           ceremony to honor the fallen law enforcement officers and the ones they have left behind.



           Location: Anchorage Memorial Statue in front of the State Crime Lab)

           Date/ Time:    Friday,   05.09.08 - 2:30 p.m.



           This time would coincide with the end of the 50th Anniversary Celebration - Press
           Conference -Print Signing at the ANC - Museum. May we just decline this request?



           The Lt. Governor's office is asking as the Lt. Governor feels either the Governor or the
           Lt. Governor should be present for event listed below:



           4/25th Dedication for Spartan Memorial - 4th Brigade Combat Team.


                                                                1

            Location:    Fort Richardson

            Date/Time:    Friday,    05.16. 08 - 10:00 a.m.



            You previously commented "can do if short." Event approx. 1 hour in duration.



            The whole 4-25 BDE of 3800 paratroopers will be in attendance , we have approximately 200
            family members of soldiers killed in Iraq attending, the Elmendorf Wing Commander is
            attending, our CG MG Layfield will be present, plus spouses and other local military
            members will also attend. I would say grand total in attendance will be about 5000.



            The Governor is not expected to do anything but show up and if she wishes, she can meet
            and greet some of the family members of our fallen soldiers. She will not be required to
            speak or do anything formal.



            The event starts 16 May at 1000hrs , but we plan to have everyone seated and ready for the
            ceremony by 0945. The event will end at 1100hrs.



            Thank you, Janice
