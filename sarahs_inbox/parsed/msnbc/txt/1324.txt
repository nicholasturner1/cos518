  Alaska's Youngest Governor




  Sarah Palin '87 is a rising star. She was featured in a Newsweek article about women in state
  government and interviewed on Charlie Rose's national PBS program. She is mentioned as
  possible candidate for Congress and there's even a Web site promoting her for vice president in
  2008.
  The youngest governor in Alaska's history and the first born since statehood, Palin is a 1987
  graduate of the University of Idaho.
  Combining her curiosity with her love of writing, she decided to pursue a degree in journalism.
  "I was always asking everyone the questions, and I still am today," Palin says.
  Palin first got into politics running for city council in Wasilla, Alaska. Palin says her youth was
  more of an issue to voters than her gender, but that didn't stop her from running for mayor of
  Wasilla and winning when she was only 32.
  "We accomplished a lot in the fastest growing area of the state, we reduced a bunch of taxes,"
  Palin says. "Our agenda worked."
  In early 2006, Palin sensed dissatisfaction with some of Alaska's long-time political figures and
  decided to run for governor.
  "Knowing that former Governor Frank Murkowski's term was about to end, and seeing that it
  was the same old people wanting to run, I said to myself, `Let's get way out there and take a

  developers to supply the U.S."
  With five offices located across Alaska, Palin is constantly traveling while trying to send as
  much time as possible with her husband and four children.
  Palin's approval rating among voters hovers between 80 and 90 percent. Some Alaskans have
  suggested her as a candidate for U.S. Senate or for Alaska's single seat in the House of
  Representatives. Palin's father, Chuck Heath, says his daughter isn't interested in higher office
  - for now. "She's here to stay," he says. "Her honesty has gotten her through everything in her
  political career, and we're proud of the effects her honesty has had on the state."
