              Governor:



              Channel 2 and the AP ran short stories on the issue of the Feds proposed change in the
              cruise ship rules.  Our letter opposing the rule change was mentioned. So far, Governors
              of Maine, Florida, and California and our congressional delegation have also sent in
              comments opposing the rule change.



             Status at this point is that LAW has an attorney reviewing the rule change and the
             procedure used by the Feds to propose the change. We should have results from that
             research in 2-3 weeks.



             Randy
