                Kelly, do you have driving directions for this for the Governor in the event she goes today? I tried to look
                it up, and it comes back as Timberlane (not Timberland) off of Klatt Road?

               Was a time finalized?

                Good morning -

                Rep Craig Johnson just called to invite you to a going-away party for John Tracy this Sunday,
                he'll call back with exact time.

                Many many of the past employees will be attending so he wanted to be sure you were included.
                It'll be held at Rep Johnson's home - since his wife has worked for Channel 2 News for 25
                years.

                Address: 12200 Timberland Drive (south Anchorage)

                Kelly
