             I'll not let them know that I will still try to get there, but its just looking impossible
             at this stage ... I'll keep trying without them knowing that.

             Governor - I have just spoken with Judy Bittner, Board Pres., Iditarod Ntl. Historic Trail
             regarding Saturday, 02.02.08 - Seward Event. I explained to Judy that due to the aircraft
             section notifying us that they are unable to land in Seward during this time of year, you
             would not be available to take an 8 hour section out of your schedule for this event. I
             also explained that Kris Perry is on medical leave an unavailable. Judy of course was
             disappointed and asked if the Lt. Governor would be available to attend in your place. I
             said I would contact the Lt. Governor's office today to see if he was available. Thanks,
             Janice
