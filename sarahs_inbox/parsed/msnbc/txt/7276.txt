         Governor,



         The event is definitely a family event . The Safe Schools / Healthy Students project and the
         Boys and Girls Club are partnering with community agencies to put together this year's
         Family Day Celebration . Last year's event had over 300 attendees .   There are many family
         activities and the invitation letter specifically invited you and your family .   They are
         also requesting you prepare a proclamation designating the 3rd Saturday of June as Alaska
         Family Day Celebration . Any chance Willow would read the proclamation?




         Mike

         Hi kris- do you remember if its a kid - friendly event? Was the family invited? If so, could
         still go if Pip and Willow travel , if not then no b/c I'm not leaving them with sitters
         for that long ( on top of not having see Willow since May 22)

         Now that the cabinet meeting is Friday, is Ketchikan still a go for Saturday?
