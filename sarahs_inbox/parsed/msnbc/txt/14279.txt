           MESSAGE:

           Congratulations on the birth of your little boy! I have three sons, two of whom are
           special needs.  My children are 25, 17, and 12. My 17 year-old has autism and is severely
           mentally retarded and my 12 year-old has cerebral palsy and is also severely mentally
           retarded.



           These boys bring special challenges but they also bring special joys. They,are the loves
           of my life. I could not imagine my life without them, nor could I imagine them being any
           way other than the way God made them.



           I can only hope your family is as blessed by your son with the same love and joy our boys
           have brought to our home.



           On behalf of all families with special needs children, I thank you and your husband for
           publicly welcoming your little boy with open arms and open hearts. What a wonderful
           example you've set for other parents who may be faced with the same challenges with which
           you've been faced during this pregnancy. You're an inspiration to us all!



           Again, congratulations!
