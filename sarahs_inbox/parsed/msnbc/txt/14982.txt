            Does anyone know where the letter is?



           No need to fall into Forgey's trap on this and react to his question about my intentions
           on Juneau energy relief - as Tom pointed out in his email we are very, very intent on (and
           engaged in) statewide relief for high energy prices. I listened to the Disaster Cabinet
           and its decision was to not declare a statewide emergency caused by the avalanche. But
           Forgey is known for misconstruing most everything I/we say, so the less said the better
           until we get to announce our statewide energy relief plan.

           Governor-



           The Juneau Empire is asking about a letter you received yesterday from the Juneau
           delegation. In the letter, they outlined why they believe the Disaster Policy Cabinet
           erred by defining a disaster too narrowly. Mike Nizich is hoping to arrange a
           teleconference with you, himself and General Campbell tomorrow at 2 p.m. to discuss the
           findings and options to move forward. I don't have much to tell the Empire at this point.
            May I tell the Empire about the impending meeting?
