           They will be up today. The order for this morning is Pat Galvin giving an overview and
           refresher on AGIA and how the Law works. That wont be short, but it wont be too long
           either.  Then Tony will present the TC application.




            They dont start until 10 am so my guess is that we may not see Tony up until after lunch.
