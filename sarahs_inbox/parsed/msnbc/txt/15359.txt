                    the Texas House of Representatives. Here is what they had to say.

               !THE FEDERAL BUDGET: "A series of non-decisions"




                   Federal budgets face splits between Congress and the White House , differences between House and Senate , and small Democratic majorities in
                   both houses that make coalition-building necessary , yet difficult as coalitions keep shifting . Add to that difficulties of producing compromises on
                   virtually any point even when ultimate goals are agreed. Says Vic Miller, Senior Fellow at Federal Funds Information for States, 'It's very difficult to
                   reach consensus."

                    All is not doom and gloom in the 50 States. PT spoke with John Otto, who represents the 18th District in Texas's House of Representatives.
                    Said Otto, 'our housing market has not seen the declines we've seen in the rest of the country.'

                   SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS

                   "No different than any other institutional investor"




                                                Georges Sudarskis, Senior Investment Controller at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , (better known as ADIA)
                   spoke at a recent conference . ADIA is the word's largest institutional investor and recently made headlines with its $7.5 billion stake in
                   beleaguered Citigroup as well as buying into private equity firms Carlyle (through a related entity , Mubadala) and Apollo Management In a
                   presentation that represented the first of its kind, Sudarskis said that, 'a sovereign fund's attitude towards private equity investments is no
                   different than that of any other institutional investor.' And, that the ingredients of success include 'diversification , patience, hard work, and a long
                   term perspective.'
