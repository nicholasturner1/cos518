                Subject: Lyda Letter
               I'm sure this was forwarded to you today but just in case, here is the official letter from Lyda
               asking you to include HB364 and HB301 into the SS.

               Joslin is putting together a letter going out from her group challenging Lyda to call her own
               special session if this issue is this important to her. They're working through the text of the letter
               within her board.

               Spoke with Jim Minnery and he's on the fence, but also intrigued with the idea of Lyda doing her
               own. Jeff Turner is courting his support to join her. He says he knows Lyda is playing games
               and messed this up, but would like to see Parental Consent included as he believes it has the
               votes.

               Eddie was hardcore today that Lyda is trying to appease voters by passing this buck to the
               Governor-saying that there are no "do-overs" or "mulligans" on votes.

                I'm putting together some notes I hope will be helpful but won't hit you with those tonight.
