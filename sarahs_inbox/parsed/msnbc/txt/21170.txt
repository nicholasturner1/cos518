          They conducted 13 interviews to come up with four. I have detailed phone notes on all

          I have asked Janice to schedule interview times no later Monday, Nov 19th. Our 45 day
          clock will run out on Nov 23rd or 24th, depending on when the Council issues their press
          release . Shall we do these in person or schedule them over the phone?
