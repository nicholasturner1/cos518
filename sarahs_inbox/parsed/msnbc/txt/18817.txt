           The ADN changed his header from "It's nice to have a visible governor." Thought you'd like to see if
           you hadn't already. How much is our PFD??? Have a good day...

           We finally have a governor who doesn't hide in Juneau

           It's nice to have a governor who likes to spend time among the majority of the Alaska people.
           Not hiding in Juneau, out of sight, out of mind. For a change, this governor, Sarah Palin, is
           around Anchorage, the Valley, Kenai and Fairbanks. I see her commuting to work, even walking
           around the Alaska State Fair with her family. It's high time the rest of Alaska gets a chance to be
           in on some of our government, and see how it works.

           Thanks to Palin for being a people person and letting all of Alaska in on our government. Keep
           up the good work.
