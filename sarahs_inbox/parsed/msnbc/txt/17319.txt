             Subject: Pat Forgey
            Just an update for everyone involved in the Pat Forgey article / debacle.

            I spent some time on the phone this afternoon with Lori Thomson, managing editor of the
            Juneau Empire. She listened to all my concerns. I emailed her the attached, which is a
            paragraph by paragraph assessment of the story and then faxed to her the Murkowski
            transition report paragraph on the data loss as well as the memorandum that Sharon
            Leighow forwarded to Forgey regarding the three essential redactions with the entire Palin
            to Palin transition reports.

            Lori promises to review the article again, look through my notes, and speak with Pat about
            his story.

            I told her at the highest level we've got a serious problem with the story because It is
            almost completely inaccurate and for the most part responsive to the Murkowski transition
            report when he is writing about the Palin transition reports.

            We'll see where this leads.

            Thanks,
            Meghan
