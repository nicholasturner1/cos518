            MESSAGE:

            I just wanted to congratulate Governor Palin on the birth of her new son, Trig. I am the
            mother of a 23 year old son with Down. Syndrome. Jeremy is a joy and a blessing in our
            lives.  My husband calls him his "hero". He loves the Lord with such a pure love that
            challenges his parents all the time. He knows Scripture like you wouldn't believe and can
            pull out and quote a verse in ways that put us to shame. We need to study more.



            Jeremy is working almost full time and living in a house with two other young men. He is
            self-supportive and doing great . Our philosophy when raising him was that he would be
            treated no different than our other children and would be given the same opportunities to
            grow that they had . I believe we all have benefitted by that.



            Enjoy your beautiful son.       He will bring so much joy to your hearts.



            Thank you for all you do to protect families.



           Bevely Brimer
