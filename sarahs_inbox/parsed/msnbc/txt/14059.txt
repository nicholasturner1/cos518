             MESSAGE:

             I appreciate your efforts to contain this spending spree the legislators are on. The state
             is repeating the past history of unrestrained spending and government expansion, only to
             worry about how to support it at a later date. The state retirement program is a good
             example. Thank You, Thank You for working at keeping the state spending under control.
