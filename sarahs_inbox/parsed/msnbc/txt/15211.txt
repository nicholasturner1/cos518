            Oh...and Steve and I will be working on costs, slides, and talking points today. We
            should have some good stuff for you to look at by the end of the day.

           We've had a few emails end up in reporters and leggies' hands this past week. Anyone know
           how the press got ahold of Steve's email from Friday, asking for input on energy plan?
