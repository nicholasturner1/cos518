            ft

            The Alaska Journal of Commerce & the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce
            are sponsoring a policy forum to discuss oil production decline and state tax policy. Selected
            state officials, legislators, petroleum company managers and Alaska business leaders will
            participate.

            The forum will discuss implications of the present decline in North Slope oil production, steps
            that can be taken to delay or mitigate decline until commercial gas production begins,and the role
            that state tax policy will play in investment decisions that will affect oil production levels.
