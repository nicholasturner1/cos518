         He's tough to get ahold of, and more power to him for that!

         Governor,

         I received a call from Rick Halford, who was calling from Dillingharr

                                                                    1

         and in and out of Alegnagik. Rick was asking if he needs to plan on any

         further discussions with you, or a trip to Juneau. He intends to call

         me back later today since he cannot always be reached on his cell

         phone.     If you would like to talk with him directly I could redirect him

         to you.



         Also, I know the Legislative leadership is meeting with you on Monday

         morning, although I am not sure if it is focused on AGIA, solely, or

         not.     Do you want Pat, Tom or me to attend this meeting? Please feel

         free to say no, but I need to ask as various legislators are broaching

         the meeting with us.

         Thanks,

         Marty
