              Found out someone sent the email to Bitney- from there it went to the press. Mystery
              solved, sort of.

              I was thinking Mike    had the foresight to plan for the possiblity that someone would leak
              since he signed the    letter to a large group like that. Again, that doesn't mean he planned
              it-rather, he might    have planned for and protected against the possibility as best he
              could with a clear,    positive message like what went out. Am I just being naive?

              Who's "he"? Mike? He says he doesn't know who would have leaked it.

             My two cents. . .the email looks like it was written with the possibility of disclosure in
             mind. It's very clean, communicates the message well that fits with who you are, but is
             also good for public consumption. That doesn't mean you did it, or even that he intended
             it that way--just that he took precautions knowing disclosure was possible . How's that for
             believing the best of someone?

             Dan Fagan is talking about this ...a letter being leaked from the Governor's office. I'm
             just not sure if he is talking about the leak to ADN or if it was also leaked to him too.

               send what he received - which he did. I said - funny Kyle I don't see

              your name on the email string - he laughed and said he would not reveal

              his source.

              Sharon: Heartbreaking to know someone would have leaked my email this

              morning- Sunny said it had to have been sent to AAN within the first

              hour. I think it would do me good to ask Kyle how he received it - he

              won't tell me, but he'll know that I know how improper it is for

              internal emails to team members to be leaked to reporters.
