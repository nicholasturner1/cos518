            Hi Ivy, If you get a comfortable opportunity , please let Gov Palin know that I am making myself available to fill
            the vacancy being left by Vic and currently going through the District procedure to get my name forwarded.               I
            am a little surprised at the level of interest by others , but I do feel I can fill the hole with the least "bump" when I
            look at other applicants so I am pressing on until I hit a wall. I will certainly respect any appointment Sarah
            makes-- but l want her to know 1 am in the running ... and I'm open to your advice if you have any.                There
            should be an interview tomorrow , and a short speech on Friday and a decision by District on who's names to
            forward shortly thereafter.

            Thanks

            wes
