          Governor,



          I will definately contact Chuck when I get back to town next week. I will

         be in Seattle the rest of this week meeting with EPA and my counterparts from the NW
         states and western provinces.



         I look forward to working with you and the other cabinet members on Climate Change issues
         and opportunities.  I appreciate this is just one of many diverse matters on your big
         plate!  You are doing a great job keeping it all moving forward.



         Larry

         Hi Larry:




         My brother, Chuck Heath, is one of the school teachers participating in the Climate Change
         study program (for science teachers) at UAF this summer. He'd like to talk to you about
                                                                 1




                                                                                                           P RA_G S P01 _0003286

         his ideas for a task force - I explained you have the sub-committee already studying the
         issue , but maybe there are ideas from what he and his fellow teachers are learning that
         could be incorporated into our sub - committee ' s mission.



         Chuck ' s request comes on the heels of some great ideas that Tom and Marty shared with me
         re: Alaska really getting serious about dealing with climate change impacts.



         If you want to contact Chuck, his email address is chckheath@yahoo. com. His emails on
         this matter are attached below. If it's more convenient, I could give himt your email
         address?



         I'm getting more and more enthused about digging into the subject and working on it -
         especially after hearing from Tom and Marty on ideas they believe the state could be
         considering . Thanks for your patience with me along the way!

         Yes.     I've already talked with a senior scientist here

          who's putting a list together today.
