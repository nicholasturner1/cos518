               Subject : Alaska Budget

               Please use restraint when deciding what costs to be included in the budget. I urge your support
               of Governor Palin's efforts to rein in spending and control of Capital projects that she Vetoed
               last year.

               We all want to have a bright future for Alaska - Let's spend wisely!!!
