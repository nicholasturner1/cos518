            I'm hearing from many who are doing the same thing - I'm shopping around for my own at
            this point - and shouldn't have let my personal cell contract(s) end some months ago.

           Dear governor palin. I have two staff who have already reached the same conclusion as you
           and gone out and bought personal equipment rather than deal with the reporting they
           anticipate . Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
           Privileged or Pe
           Talis.

           Frank- Doesn't it still just make more sense to get personal blackberry and soley use
           that? No way in heck do I have time to track what's business and what's not. (Shoot- if
           "vacation time" like today is any indication of "off-state time" time, after receiving and
           sending umpteen emails and calls these past few days - then it's a whack system to have to
           consider ANY time is "personal time", and most every call/email should not have to be
           decifered re: percent of time that's spent "personally".



            Kami and other IT people have already turned in their state equipment, so it must make
           more sense to use personal- otherwise they wouldn't have done that.

           Hello,



           Attached are two documents that should be distributed to your employees to update them on
           where we are with the tax policy for electronic listed property. The "update" document
           provides some details on what has been decided and what has not. High points include:




           *     Department of Law is reviewing the draft policy and FAQs that were distributed in
           December and evaluating them against IRS requirements.  Final policy for the State of
           Alaska is pending this review.

           *     An annual authorization form is being developed for employees and supervisors to
           document the agreement on use of electronic listed property.  The draft is attached, and
           feedback is on this draft is appreciated.

           *     The delay in finalizing our policy means that employee reporting will not occur in
           February as indicated in the original FAQs. However for W-2s to be accurate for 2008, the
           reporting period must include January.  Employees will be required to report personal use
           of state-provided assets starting for the full 12 months of 2008.

           *     Similarly allowances can be paid for months beginning in January when a personal
           cell phone or PDA is authorized for business use.
                                                         2




                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0010252

              *     Our substantiation standard for supporting business use of state assets will only
              require an employee to identify personal use, not support all business use. This should
              greatly simplify reporting.

              *     Logs of call detail are not required , but employees may choose to keep them to help
              them identify personal calls on the cell phone invoices.

              *     Allowance amounts for personal assets have been set at       $ 40 a month for cell phones
              and $75 for PDAs.

              *     No allowance will be paid for personal laptops or home computers without a Telework
              agreement.




              If you or your employees have questions , concerns , or recommendations about information,
              including the draft form , please contact Lisa Pusich at 465 - 5616 or me. Thank you for
              your patience as we work through the details toward a policy we can live with.
