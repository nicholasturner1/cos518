            Yikes- it's frightening reading all the adds in the budget! I tell ya- the public will not
            stand for all this. And the construction industry and economy will not be able to handle
            all this. Prices will escalate because no road construction companies, especially, will
            have to compete for any work. Scares me to think of all the outside workers that will head
            up here to tackle an over-heated economy, thanks to all govt spending.

            We need to hustle on strategy to allow us to sensibly and fairly consider all items in
            this bloated budget . The sooner the better. And we ' ll need more people than we had last
            time as we pare it down . Our commissioners need to start looking at items that affect
            their depts and tell us asap what is absolutely necessary and what can be cut. Thanks



            Also- what ' s the timeline for consideration of items, and deadline for vetoes?
