        Subject: Character Initiative




        I am sending Jay Pullins to a big Character First conference in Oklahoma City in the next
        two weeks. He has a heart and interest in getting the training and trying to get it
        implemented here. Did you ever get the PowerPoint proposal for an Alaska character
        initiative we constructed?
