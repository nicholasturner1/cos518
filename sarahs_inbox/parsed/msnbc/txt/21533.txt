                He's considered in the Inner Circle now, and he 's "giving orders" to lots of people ... and I'm only conveying the
                rumor I 'm hearing ... whether its true or not

                I've tried to help the 3rd Floor a couple times ... and it backfired badly. So I stay away ... and keep my mouth shut.
