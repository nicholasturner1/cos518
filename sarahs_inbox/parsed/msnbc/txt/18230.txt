         Yes.



         Things are moving quickly.            Kurt Bruce made a good

         point this morning.        He said most of the retailers

         that handle MM products have known for weeks about the

         coming shutdown and they are already in the midst of

         securing new contracts with others to fill their dairy

         spaces .   He said a press release from you letting

         everyone know that we are on the horizon of a solution

         could stop some of the retailers from signing these

         new contracts.



         I don't think space will be a problem though because

         there will be a lot less product when it becomes 100%

         Alaskan.    Joey will be contacting Kaladi, Cafe del

        Mundo, New Sagaya, various food marts, etc. to keep

         them abreast of the situation. This is going to be

        exciting.
