               Unfortunately, I think that Halcro's description of the meeting is pretty accurate. He
               missed a few details. For example, Pat was also there, and the gas team did far more in
               DC than just meet with the delegation.

               With the gas team, we are implementing initiatives in several quarters to address the
               points discussed in the delegation meeting. Beyond this, I didn't see much new in the
               content of the exchanges which occurred.

               The delegation is convinced that we should resume negotiations with the producers. We
               have responded that you stand by the principles in AGIA and that there may be a role for
               the producers at some point later on.

               I can handle the disagreement on substance. But, even after all these years, I can't
               understand the personal attacks and vehemence of Mr. Halcro and some of his allies.

                  If this is another case of Halrco lying, then someone needs to call him on it - including
                  mainstream media that gives him a forum, such as ADN and his new employer KBYR.
                  Even KTUU continuing to go to Halcro for counterpoints re: much of what our Admin
                  does. He discredits all these media outlets.

                  He's gotten away with lies for too long - and if this is another one, he must be called on
                  it.

                   There were 11 people in the meeting. For the State, they were Marty, Tom, Pat, and
                   Larry.

                   Then, there were Senator Stevens and three of his staff: George Lowe (Chief of Staff),
                   Kate Williams (Legislative Director), and Kevin Simpson (Energy). Also present were
                   Senator Murkowski and two of her staff: Isaac Edwards (Legislative Director) and
                   Chuck Kleeschulte (Energy).

                   I can't figure out how Halcro got the information and don't know of any way to check at
                   this end. Senator Stevens has always insisted on the confidentiality of such meetings
                   and that has been respected by all concerned.

                  We've spent part of this morning correcting some inaccurate information that came out
                  of the meeting from the Senate side.

                  My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
                  obviously provided it. I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
                  relationship we hope to have with the delegation.

                  In our debrief with the gas team afterwards, we discussed each DC meeting and what,
                  if anything, we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
                  meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts, and I have
                  requested this but have not heard back.

                   Senator Stevens is adamant (and probably so is Senator Murkowski). In our collective
                   opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform, not cut off communications.

                   Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If
                   there is activity, it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the
                   only game in town, and I believe that the delegation understands that.

                   Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
                   hopefully that dialogue will help . The next big DC event is FERC' s next report to
                   Congress on the gasline . Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
                   FERC understand the current situation.

                   Because of the importance of your question, I'm taking the liberty of adding the
                   Governor to our email exchange.

                  P.S.
                  On a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well. The participants
                  were interested and receptive.

                  Jan 30: Mr. AGIA goes to Washington

                  Last week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update
                  back to Alaska's Congressional delegation.
                  With a year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR
                  Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska
                  Senators.
                  In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Irwin
                  and Rutherford encountered Senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both
                  Stevens and Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.
                  Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't
                  listen last time."
                  And, at one point, Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
                  AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."
                  As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
                  pipeline.
