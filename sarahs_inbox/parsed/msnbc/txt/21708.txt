              Thank you! That's the toughest part of the job- not being everywhere.

              I covered the topics you suggested at AML plus some . Took a hit on you not bwing there
              during Q and A. I had already expressed your regrets, etc., explained the sheer volume of
              requests and explained that if you can't make it, I show, and where you can't make it we
              attempt to set up a rotation so you make it next year. :)



               I think you' re up for 08
