           Did u tell her I could not call her yet - sheeeesh , she's got that demanding "jump"
           approach to dealing with our office. If she can't tell us what the issue is, I'm not going
           to jump.

           Governor - Russ did call Lyda and left a message on her voice mail (cell). I just
           received a call directly from Lyda asking to speak with you again and stating that she had
           left the same message this morning and had not gotten a response back from this office.
           Lyda does not want to speak with staff.

           Lyda indicated that she was preparing to leave on the plane which I wanted you to know as
           it sounds like she will be on your same flight. Thanks, Janice
