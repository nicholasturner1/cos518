           Good morning,



           Can you somehow plug me in with Mike N. and Karen R. so I participate in

           the development of your legislative agenda and budget? I'd like to play

           a meaningful role in these as your LG. And, I see it as necessary for a

           more seamless transition months from now with the VP potential you have.



           Sean
