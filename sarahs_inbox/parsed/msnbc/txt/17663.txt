            Governor Palin, Mr. Tibbles, Commissioner Jackson:

            Here is the final list of the Health Council . Twelve voting members, 2 HESS chairs, 2 co-chairs, and
            Commissioner Jackson . Privileged has been removed.

            I am advocating for 12 voting members . I think this final list strikes a balance , represents all sides of the
            contentious issues that arise in health care , and will deliver to the governor and the Legislature a report that is
            thorough , objective and justified.

            We had nearly 100 applicants in all, and have spent two months developing this board.

            Thank you all for your time and input. I sincerely appreciate all of your help. Please let me know if you need
            anything else.

            Thank you,

            Ivy Frye
