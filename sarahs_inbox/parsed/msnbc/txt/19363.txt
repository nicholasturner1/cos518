             So is that the green light to get this moving ? I'd be happy to make the offer and arrangements while you
             are out of state.

             By the way I have a meeting scheduled with Walt Friday afternoon. I will call you with the results of that
             meeting.

             Well, there you go. Sounds like a proponent of ushering in change via new blood in that DC.
             position. t Privil is that bill.

             Governor, do you know how loved you are? These four or five bitter people are so NOT representative. You are so,
             so loved. The enemy is trying to discourage you. Hang I there! You are doing such an awesome job. You are an
             amazing lady and the Lord is your defender. He knows the truth and He is going to vindicate you. It hurts my heart
             to hear these horrible people are bringing you down. We forgive them, Lord. Help theses people come to know You.

             Guys, I may be pretty wimpy about this family stuff, but I feel like I'm at the breaking point with the hurtful gossip
             about my family that Sherry and others get away with. Bear with me. I hate this part of the job and many days I feel
             like its not worth it when they have to put up with the hate that spews from people like Sherry, and there are others.

             Below is the email Don sent to ADN. It's not much, but we were trying to bring there attention to this ongoing and
             very frustrating situation. Her comments are downright libelous. You're right-she's a crazy hater.

                 Dear Sir or Madam,



                  I'm writing to bring your attention to the increasingly inapropriate comments posted by the blogger syrin . Every day she
            posts comments that have absolutely no bearing on policy . For example, today the ADN posted a positive story on the
            national press Governor Palin is receiving, yet syrin accuses the governor of having an affair or makes hateful comments
            about her young children . I don't often feel compelled to write , but syrin's comments are never on topic, nor are they civil as
            is stated in the terms of use.



                 Thank you for your time.




            9/18/2009
