         Randy- when you get a sec could you contact acting commish Glass and ask him a few
         questions on the next trooper academy- when, how many guys are going through, what can I
         do to help get word out around AK that we want more cream-of-the-crop applicants, etc. Pls
         let him know I'd love a status report on that (plus status on other areas too).

             Once I hear from him through you I'll start emailing him.

            Better yet, I'd like him to travel to. Juneau early this week to meet with us in person
         and give us the current lay of the land... please invite him to do so. If he's unavailable
         early in the week then Audie should come.
