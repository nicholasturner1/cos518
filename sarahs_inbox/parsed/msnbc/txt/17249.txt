         Governor,



         Since I'll be in DC next week at the National Lt. Gov. Association conference, we had
         called Drue Pearce to ask for a meeting. Drue responded and mentioned pulling together a
         lot of people from different agencies. Although I expected just a friendly individual
         meeting with Drue, I'm happy to take the opportunity with the larger group to walk through
         AGIA. Is this a group that you or other members of the gasline team met with while you
         were back there? Is there anything in particular I should be aware of?



         And, can I get your DC messaging material,            assuming it hasn't changed?



         Sean

        Make sure Sean feels comfortable with presenting the AGIA to the federal

        interagency MOU signatories - which include senior staff , mostly appointed,

        from each of 16 agencies .        He'll be the " draw" and I expect lots of
                                                             1
