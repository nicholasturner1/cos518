             She's be great, and really the job isn't based in Juneau - I went 'round and 'round with
             Tibbles on that, explaining it'd be too tough to find a flexible individual if we forced
             him or her to stay full-time in Juneau ( same issue we face trying to fill so many
             positions), so this position (along with most others) will be flexible. Remeber that
             outside the Leg session , no one's really in the capitol bldg, certainly no media. They're
             mostly in Anchorage. If you want to talk to Priyilea let me know Privileged or Personal Material
