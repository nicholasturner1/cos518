              Hi Sarah,   Just thought I'd share a little pearl that will probably make you
              smile.   Lexie just won an "Al Neuharth Free Spirit Award/Scholarship" in journalism
              (He is the founder of USA Today). Anyway, they choose 2 students from each state
              and bring them all to Washington, DC to compete for a 50K scholarship in March.
              Since you were at Colony High to induct Lexie into Quill&Scroll, I thought you
              would appreciate the scope of this award. By the way, her focus is currently on
              Pre-Med... go figure!!  Take Care, keep up the good work. Kathy Krell
