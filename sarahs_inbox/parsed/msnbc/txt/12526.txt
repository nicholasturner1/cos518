             Dear Governor Palin:



             Mrs. Palin,

             I forgot to add one thing in my last message .        The Vets For Freedom are a

             good organization that I'm just getting involved in that          is comprised of a

             great many IRAQ/AFGHANISTAN vets that are trying         to make Americans aware

             of what "really" is going on in. the Global War on Terror.         It is something

             that was recently formed to give the American         people a   "real" view of what

             is going on overseas since the current media outlets         are sending out

             dissinformation and propaganda about the war.         We want America to hear from

             the soldiers that have been there and are over there. You should check it

             out and see if you can help them. the website         is: www . vetsforfreedom.com




             If you have questions ,     i can put-you in contact with the people in charge

             here in Alaska. Again, keep up the good work!



             Sincerely,




             CW2 "Chip"    Steele
