 Subject :    Senate President's Response to Inquiries Regarding the Joint Session for the Governor's
              State of the State Address

 RE: Combined State of the State and State of the Budget Address by the Governor
  Initially, the Senate was contacted by Speaker Harris' office regarding the date and the starting
 time for the Governor's address, the Senate conveyed to his office that either 6:00pm or 7:00pm
 would be acceptable to Senate members. Speaker Harris' office asked the Senate President to
 agree to a 7:00pm start time (as is traditional), and the Senate agreed. The House of
 Representatives is responsible for arranging the date and time for a Joint Session of the Alaska
 State Legislature, and then for inviting the Senate and the Governor.

 Today, in order to better accommodate the Governor's personal travel schedule, the Alaska State
 Senate has requested that the House of Representatives change the time of the Joint Session from
 7:00pm to 4:00pm, so that the Governor will have ample time to catch her flight to travel out-of-
 state for personal/family reasons.

 Both letters are attached for your review. Thank you.

 Lyda Green
 President of the Senate
