MESSAGE:

Dear Sarah,

I just wanted to congratulate you on the birth of your "special"

beautiful baby . Although it was not mentioned specifically in the press release , I assume he has
special needs . I am the mother of 3 daughters and my oldest has Down Syndrome . My life and the
lives of my entire family are truly blessed because of her . I am praying for your entire family at this
wonderful time. REMEMBER IT IS WONDERFUL!

Best,

Jeanne Doherty

Billerica, Ma
