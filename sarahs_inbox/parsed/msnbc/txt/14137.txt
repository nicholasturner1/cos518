            Russ- I want to approve the list of bill signing invitees before these folks are actually
            invited. Thanks.



            Also- still haven't heard updates on bills' status. I'll try to follow on-line, and I'll
            retrieve info from the bills Frank is following, but I still need status report before
            more press inquiries pour in to Sharon and Rosanne.

             Is it safe to say Stedman has still not shown us everything in his multi-million dollar
             spending bill that the House is adding on to... or have they released the item list but I
             just haven ' t seen it yet?
