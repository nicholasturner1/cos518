        Great great news!



        I am so glad you had the support of the Interior delegation and other

        city governments in and around Fairbanks on AGIA, it means we're

        headed in the right direction in Fairbanks (not often the case!).



        Fairbanks is 32 degrees today, rainy and chance of snow, I'm sure

        summer is around the corner, global warming !@#$#@$%

        Melissa
