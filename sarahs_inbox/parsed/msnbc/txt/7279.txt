         Kris- i like Larry. He's going to call it the way he sees it and not bs with us. I like
         that.




         Thanks for hooking up the phone call w/him last night. I'm on the airplane very glad to
         get out of that conference. Too many male govs who sure like to hear themselves talk.



         I hate to admit that the conf agenda was a waste of time. Nothing much about oil and gas
         nor other relevant topics pertaining to AK.




         Anxious to tour MatMaid and see what we can do. We need to change out the BAC and creamery
         bd. Franci Havemeister, Janet Kincaid, her son-in-law, (though I haven't asked any of them
         yet) and one other business mind will be needed to replace bd members so we can implement
         a close-out plan or figure out what's next. Maybe Kristan Cole? She sat on Ag Rev Loan
         Fund under Gov Hickel.

        Thanks very much.



        Process used w/cbm in MatSu is good example re: why reasonable notice and more opportunity
        for local input is prudent. Thank you

         Governor,




         I'll try to get you some budget comments later in the week, but I first

         want to follow up on our conversation of earlier this evening regarding

         notice of oil shale leasing. I did some checking, and the issue

         apparently involves lease notices. Congress wanted to speed up the

         leasing process, so it limited states to 14 days for comment -- in

         addition to time allocated for the usual public comments. It appears the

         Western states feel rushed at 14 days additional to public comment and

         want more time.




         I suppose the feds could argue they don't want to allow for longer

         comment periods by the states, as the Interior Department is pushing to

         open more areas to oil shale leases. But remembering how messed up it

         got with coalbed methane leases in the MatSu because of a rush job with

         inadequate public notice, I'd say it's good policy to allow states an

         additional time -- a reasonable time -- to ensure there are no

         unresolved problems before opening an area to oil shale leases . Allowing

         120 days additional comment on a multi-year lease and potential drilling

         and production site does not seem unreasonable to me.



        Larry



         >>> <gov.sarah@yahoo.com> 06/08/07 8:15 PM >>>

        Both. Give me your opinion(s) freely.



        I so dislike this budget process. We need legislators who will help with

        sustainable budgets - not fight them. I do believe they believe in

        fiscal responsibility - the system just doesn't let them exercise their

        sensibilities.




        I receive way too many emails each day, but the more information the
                                                        2

         better. I just don't answer them all b/ c I assume our folks know that

         I'm reading them and considering the content.



         I'm delayed here in MN on way to SD so am catching up w/mail.



         Thanks

         Governor,



         I see that you included me as a cc on this budget-veto e-mail. While

         flattered, I don't want to overstep any lines of authority or work

         assignments. While I'm always happy to express my opinions (no shortage

         there), I wanted to ask if you cc'd me on the email to solicit my

         opinions or just as a heads-up. I also don't want to add to what I'm

         certain is a long list of lengthy e-mails you already receive each day.



         Larry

         Subject: Budget




         John : i was asked yest by reporters what percentage         ( budget cuts) we're

         aiming for - didn ' t have a specific number but declared we would be

         vetoing .   It occurred to me we need to enlist the help of legislators,

         esp those who came out of the session screaming that their colleagues

         spent too much money.

         We'll give them the opportunity to help the state.



         Would you figure out how to reach out to them in requesting their ideas

         on cuts - some line items are in districts where the local legislator

         did not even request the item, it appears . They need to give input on

         where we can afford to cut, delay funding, or phase in funding . We need

         to do this asap.



         Perhaps a letter from the third floor giving them a head ' s up reminder

         that we must live within our means and a strong request to tell us how

        they can help.



        I know it ' s probably never been done before , but so be it . But it's got

        to be done soon.



        Also, I'm very anxious to hear from Cabinet members their suggestions

        for cuts, too. Mike - would you forward this to Commissioners as the
                                                           4
