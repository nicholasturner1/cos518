           Governor:



           Morgan Hite, the defendant in the murder case who was considering opposing extradition
           from Alaska to Colorado has decided not to-challenge the warrant and extradition. We will
           release her to the custody of Colorado authorities when they appear to pick her up and
           escort her to Colorado.

           FYI and please let the Governor know. The only thing left is for the requisitioning state
           to pick her up.
