        Mike- would you have Beth work with Seamount of the IOGCC speech. That's coming up quickly
        and I'm not sure what they're expecting from me. It's a 15-min speech titled "View from
        Alaska" is what I understand. The speech needs to be in the context of the meetings'
        agendas.
