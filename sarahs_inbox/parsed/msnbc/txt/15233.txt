            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on your new baby. You will enjoy the differences this child has from
            other children.  And when he is old enough, you will have lots of fun with Special
            Olympics.



            Our kids really shine when participating in sports, and sports has so much to teach all of
            us.



            My "baby" is 35, and I'm still enjoying watching him achieve and grow.



            Best wishes to all of you,



            Alice
