           Talking Points for RGA Press Conference



           On Tuesday, Senator McCain released his economic plan. His focus on policy at a critical
           time for our nation's economy stands in sharp contrast to the political games being played
           by the Democrats. While Obama complains about bitter voters in Pennsylvania, Senator
           McCain is proposing a summer gas tax holiday, middle class tax cuts, a simpler tax code,
           and the elimination of pork barrel spending. As Clinton exaggerates her experience,
           Senator McCain is offering straight talk on the economy and is working to lower trade
           barriers, tackle entitlements, and encourage growth and innovation.



           Topline Messaging Points:



                     On Tuesday, John McCain proposed a comprehensive plan for getting the economy
           back on track while implementing the reforms that will maintain America's economic
           strength for the 21st century.   John McCain outlined his vision for growing the economy
           and contrasted that vision with Senators Obama's and Clinton's plans to raise taxes,
                                                                  1

           continue wasteful spending and isolate the United States from the global economy..



                       John McCain will act quickly and decisively to meet today's economic challenges.




                     John McCain believes we must act now to grow our economy both in the near-term
           and the long-term.



                     John McCain is prepared to lead our economy. With years of experience working
           on economic issues, he knows what we must do now to grow our economy today.



           A Near-Term Agenda For Economic Growth:



                     HIGHER LIVING COSTS : John McCain will enact a summer gas tax holiday, stop
           filing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce demand, and end policies that contribute
           to higher living costs.



                     HOUSING CRISIS : John McCain has proposed a new " HOME Plan " to provide robust,
           timely and targeted help to those hurt by the housing crisis.    He has also called for a
           Justice Department task force to investigate wrongdoing in the mortgage industry.



                     STUDENT LOANS: John McCain is proposing a student loan continuity plan that will
           coordinate policies with the states to keep the credit crunch from hurting college
           students.



           A Long- Term Agenda For Economic Growth:



                     MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS: John McCain will cut taxes on middle class families.  He
           will permanently repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) saving a middle class family
           with children an average of over $2,700. He will also double the personal exemption for
           dependents.




                     PRO-GROWTH TAX POLICY: John McCain will keep taxes low by fighting efforts to
           raise taxes and making it harder to raise taxes . He will keep the current rates on
           dividends and capital gains while permitting businesses to immediately deduct the cost of
           equipment and technology.



                      CORPORATE TAX CUT: John McCain will reduce the federal corporate tax rate to 25
           percent from 35 percent .  By reducing the corporate tax rate, we will get rid of a drag on
           economic growth and job creation , and help American workers compete with any company in
           the world.



                       INNOVATION TAX CUTS :   John McCain will ban Internet taxes and new cell phone
                                                             2




                                                                                                         PRA GSP01_0015192

            taxes, and establish a permanent tax credit equal to 10 percent of wages spent on research
            and development.



                     SIMPLER TAXES: John McCain proposes an alternative new and simpler tax system.
           When this reform is enacted, all who wish to stay under the current system could still do
           so, but everyone else could choose a vastly less complicated system with two tax rates and
           a generous standard deduction.



                     ELIMINATING WASTEFUL SPENDING: John McCain will stop earmarks , pork-barrel
           spending and waste . He proposes a one-year spending pause so as to evaluate all spending
           programs. He will veto any pork-barrel project that crosses his desk.



                     ENTITLEMENTS: John McCain will reform Social Security, act to control Medicare
           growth and believes we should not subsidize prescription drugs for America's most affluent
           individuals.




                     TRADE: John McCain will lower trade barriers to ensure that foreign markets are
           open to American goods.



                     UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE: John McCain will implement badly needed reforms to the
           Unemployment Insurance system by creating Lost Earning Buffer Accounts ( LEBs ) to help
           workers when they lose a job.



                     HEALTH CARE REFORM: John McCain has proposed comprehensive health care reform
           that will address rising costs and make the system more responsive to the needs of
           American families.



                     ENERGY: As President, John McCain will propose a real national strategy for
           energy security.



           Contrast With Democrats:



                      The American people have a clear choice in this election. While John McCain
           supports pro-growth tax cuts, both Senators Obama and Clinton support a massive tax
           increase on the American people that will hurt Americans of every background - seniors,
           parents , small business owners and investors of every size.



                      Senators Obama and Clinton have championed a long list of pork-barrel projects.
           That kind of careless spending of tax dollars is not change, but business as usual in
           Washington.




           Senators Obama and Clinton preach the false virtues of economic isolationism. Opening new
