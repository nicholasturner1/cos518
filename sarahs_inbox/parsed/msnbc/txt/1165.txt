MESSAGE:

Dear Governor, You are amazing! WE are so blessed to have you. Congradulations on your new
baby. He too is so blessed to have come into your family. I must say I was a bit dissappointed that
you could not wait and have him on the 15th as that is my birthday...but I will get over it don't worry.
You are the best thing this state has ever seen. I know this as I was born and raised in the territory
of Alaska, that gives away my age but even so when I grow up I want to be just like you! Sincerly,
Laura Hamilton
