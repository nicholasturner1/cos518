              Dear Governor Palin,



              With your sucess in crippling the crooks in Alaska, maybe you should consider doing the
              same in Washington, D.C.

              Not only are your ethics a fresh breeze in the world of politics, you are way better
              looking than the Senator from the State of .......

              Keep up the "good fight".



              My best regards,




              Jerry W. Morrison
