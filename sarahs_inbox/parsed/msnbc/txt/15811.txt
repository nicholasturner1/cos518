           Message:I know you are working hard to sort out the capital bill. I wanted to put in

           a plug for transportation infrastructure--both those indluded in the capital bill and
           those included in the proposed bond. Federal funding is drying up and we will need to
           begin to pay more of these costs through the transportation and general funds. Please
           read the following article with

           Forbes article about the next reauthorization of the Federal transportation funding. The
           current authorization expires on September 30, 2009.



           Thanks for all your hard work.
