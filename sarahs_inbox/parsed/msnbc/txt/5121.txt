                       1. Stanton Katchatag : I went to the memorial service for Stanton Katchatag yesterday, a
                          Unalakleet elder, AFN Elder of the Year , and husband of Irene for 69 years. Most
                          touching was Irene (the widow) singing "How Great Thou Art" in Inupiaq and when she
                          finished Irene proclaimed with conviction , "God is great!"
