                 If you approve of the meeting, I might recommend 2:55pm.

                 Limit to two questions:

                 Bill will ask -
                 "Why are communications not working ... that' s how Lyda and Hollis characterized it."

                 "Why do you and Lyda not get along?"

                 "Why was it so disappointing to not see your amendments make it into the bill?"

                 Governor:



                 I tried earlier this morning to reply from the Alaska Airlines jet via my
                 Blackberry , but since the reply was to your yahoo account I received a form
                 letter response that the account is not used any longer.



                 Anyway, yes Ken has been offered and has accepted the job. The assertions
                 in the "taylor made" email are an unfortunate smear campaign. If at some
                 point you would like detailed rebuttal , we can provide that. But, in
                 summary, Ken is very highly regarded by wildlife management and land use
                 management professionals in Alaska (e.g., Tom Irwin) and he will be a true
                 asset to us in a wide variety of arenas including intensive management.



                 Various mainline hunting groups have called to assure me that they are not
                 involved in Mr. Flory's efforts ; several have even gone so far as to remind
                 me that Mr. Flory is a convicted sex offender who at least one would banish
                 from his association if he could. I have to say I am at a loss to
                 understand what Mr. Flory hopes to accomplish by this and the newspaper
                 attacks on you, me and Ken . If his intent is to assure more intensive
                 management, it is particularly ironic, given that I hope this week to
                 present to you a plan for ramped up efforts in wolf control for the
                 remainder of this spring.



                 Please let me know if you need anything further in this regard.



                 Thanks, DL.

                 *     Mr. Taylor's ultimate claim to fame was his intense personal
                 satisfaction with his important role in moving Canadian wolves into
                 Yellowstone National Park.



                 *     At a conference in Homer with Deborah Williams ' group (now known as
                 the Alaska Conservation Voters ), Mr. Taylor recounted his efforts to aid the
                 restoration of wolves to Yellowstone National Park including the line, "I
                 cried when the wolves were released at Yellowstone ". Very progressive, Ken!
                 Now every hunter in the whole country is crying over this unmitigated
                 disaster.



                 *   Mr. Taylor, an active liberal, was an enthusiastic supporter and
                 campaigner for Democrat Fran Uhner's unsuccessful run for governor.



                 *    In Fairbanks, from about '85 to'91 (or so) he had dismal
                 performance. His penchant for playing golf and chasing "the good life" sent
                 him on the National and International meetings circuit to the point that the
                 Fairbanks staff referred to him as "The Vacancy Factor".



                 *     Mr. Taylor's tenure at Region III in Fairbanks followed a stint as
                 one of the worst area biologist 's in corporate memory . He was assigned in
                 Dillingham (Mulchatna Caribou herd, etc.) where he distinguished himself by
                 never having any data for the Board ( or probably the Region) on population
                 dynamics or changes . He virtually sat in the chair and accomplished
                 nothing.



                 *     As the management coordinator in cahoots with Chris Smith (ultra
                 greenie and "anti" sympathizer), he made sure Bob Stevenson , one of arguably
                 the best five wolf biologists in the world was taken out as the Department's
                 wolf expert and re-assigned as an area biologist . The new wolf guy was a
                 much better "yes" man.



                 *    Taylor was "responsible" for decisions during the Department's GMU
                 20A wolf control efforts and could have easily avoided the confrontation
                 with Gordon Haber, which put Gordie on the evening news after the Dept.
                 muffed efficiently killing a wolf in a snare with the cameras rolling.



                 *      In the 1990s, Taylor worked for some time as the Deputy Director of
                 the Division of Wildlife Conservation under his CSU college buddy and
                 longtime friend Wayne Reglin . Among his notable achievements , he can be
                 credited (at least in part) with the Department's disastrous wolf
                 sterilization program.



                 *    He was later appointed Director of Habitat under Tony Knowles and
                 was at the helm during the time they really got into trouble . There were

                eyewitness accounts of Habitat staffers throwing pizza parties to celebrate

                subsequently moved Habitat to DNR to neutralize the Division's radical
                environmental gang's ability to stifle industry/development.



                *    Throughout his career, Taylor was uniformly known as a worthless
                supervisor by those he supervised, except for the habitat folks whom he let
                do anything the regional Habitat Supervisor wanted to do.
