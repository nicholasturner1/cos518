           Dear governor palin. I thought you had already set it up as I got an email Friday that it
           is set for 930 Monday. I think it would be fine for Rhonda to attend. Talis.

            Janice set this up. Do you want Rhonda on the phone during this? She really wants to be
           plugged in more fully on these rural/native issues.

           Dear Governor Palin,

                 If possible I would like to meet with you for 15 - 20 minutes on Monday to review
          the Kaltag case .  It is a Native "inherent authority" appeal that will be noticed in
          Native circles.   I need to approve or deny an appeal and I want you to understand our plan
          and have an opportunity to approve or stop it as you will be likely asked about it.

                   Just let me know if I can come over anytime Monday. Talis
