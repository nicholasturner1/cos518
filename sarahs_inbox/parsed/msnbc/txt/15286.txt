               Subject: Campion Road closed emergency photos, Galena
              Hi,
              Some pits of the Galena emergency road closure to the landfill and KIYU transmitter/generator
              access problem.

              An emergency declaration will be considered by the Galena City Council Tuesday evening.

              The problem was totally unexpected this year, we understood we/DOT had many years to
              address the possible road failure.

              Also a few fun pits of Galena.

              Most pits by Kevin Munter.

              Thank you,
              Walt


              Hope .may or may not be a strategy, depending on the price of a BBL of oil.
              Failure is NOT an option.
