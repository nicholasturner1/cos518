        Right on. I'm excited to see this and participate in any way you could use me. I'd like
        some of our boards and commissions members - and applicants - to understand our permit
        process also. Thanks!

        Subject: Alaska 's Process




        Governor,



        Given the concern about Pebble, mining, and resource development in general; our large
        project team has been working hard on a presentation on how the permit process works for
        mining.  The plan is to use this presentation around the state in towns, villages,
        conventions, chamber meetings, legislature, native corporations etc.  The goal is to show
        Alaskans that Alaska has a competent permitting process.



        We would like to give a preview to you and whoever you would like from your staff. The
        presentation will take 30 to 40 minutes plus any questions.



        God bless,     Tom
