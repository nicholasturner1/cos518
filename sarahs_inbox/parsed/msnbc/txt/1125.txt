I assume she's aware, but just in case... could someone make sure the gov sees a copy? This went
out to all legislators.

Thanks,

      The Honorable Lyda Green                        The Honorable John Harris
      President of the Senate                         Speaker of the House

      Dear President Green and Speaker Harris:

             This letter is to provide each of you and other members of the Legislature with a
      progress update on the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) and the upcoming
      special session.

           We continue to make every effort to meet our previously stated schedule to
      complete the findings and determination. The commissioners of the Departments of
      Revenue and Natural Resources still expect to complete their work the week of May 19.
      We cannot state with certainty what the actual date will be.

             Based on feedback we received from legislators, if the commissioners decide to
      pursue an AGIA license, we will withhold formal transmission of any findings
      materials to your offices until the special session convenes on June 3. This action will
      allow the special session to begin on the same day that the 60-day review period begins
      for the Legislature under AGIA.

            We also will proceed with our three-day presentation of information in
     Anchorage on May 28, 29, and 30. These sessions are intended to provide a public
     presentation to the members of the Senate and House in preparation for deliberations in
     Juneau, and provide an enhanced opportunity for interaction between legislators and
     AGIA team members and our consultants. The event will be held at the Sheraton Hotel,
     where we have arranged a block of rooms for legislative attendees. If you have any
     questions about the format or logistics of this event, please contact Samantha Carroll at
     the Department of Natural Resources, at 269-8431.




                                                                                        ROSTON 02032

          Please feel free to contact my office if you have any further questions. I look
    forward to working with both of you in advancing the commercialization of Alaska's
    North Slope natural gas resources.
