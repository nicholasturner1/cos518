          It looks like the other name is Campbell, but I do not know anything about it either,
          Governor. Will track down for you.

          I had no info on this until janice "reminded" me last night, she must have assumed I had
          all the info. Who's the other premier to be called? When? Phone number?

            Janice,

            Joe Balash and I thought it a good idea for the Governor to talk personally to the two
          Premiers in order to tell them that her two Commissioners ( of DNR & Revenue) had
          determined that TransCanada Alaska ' s project ( as presented in their AGIA ' application)
          maximized Alaska ' s interests and would move the Alaska Gasline project forward. And,
          furthermore , the Governor and the Commissioners would be forwarding to Alaska's
          Legislature a recommendation to approve the recommendation that an AGIA License be issued
          to TransCanada.



            I hope this is helpful.

            Marty

            Sorry, I did not scroll down far enough to see the question .  I have an idea about how
           the discussion should go , but would not want to steer anybody wrong . Marty, who is
           copied, should answer this question , as it was Marty who determined that the Governor
           should make these two Premier calls .  Sorry I am not of any assistance.

           Yes, this is all set up. She will be making calls to both Premiers Fentie and Campbell
          in the morning .  I am fairly certain that Kris and Janice are aware of these two calls,
          but am copying them in case.

           I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
          they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



           Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
          ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
          mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I' ve never seen a request from Carol. Did
          one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
          Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
