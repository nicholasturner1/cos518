             Logistics meant the down-play . We didn 't want to play the games of a dramatic interview
             and since Commissioner Galvin was the one - Donaldson can't record from Juneau to
             Anchorage and Channel 2 can 't turn around a big story when the interview isn't available
             until 3 : 30pm . No fault of ours - just logistics. In the meantime , once we have the report, I
             suggest that we have a press availability that shows the facts and roll it out with the
             Commissioner and anyone else deemed appropriate . Donaldson and Southern both called
             Exxon yesterday and asked for proof of 13 tax changes - they never returned the call.

             Pat,
             Thanks for sending out this info. It sounds like you said all the right things,
             although the press aren't playing it as well as I would like. I'm inclined to
             agree that it would be a good idea for Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             I ended up giving quotes to APRN , Dillon, and going on Channel 2 News. Each
             wanted to focus on Tillerson 's statement that Alaska 's fiscal system has changed "13
             times in the past couple decades."

             In each interview I stressed that in the past two decades we've had 19 years of ELF

             with little substantive change , and then the system was changed last year when we had high
             oil prices and ELF proved to be out of step with oil development economics . I said that on the
             royalty side , most of Exxon 's production is coming from leases that have been in place for
             over 30 years . I also commented on Alaska as a stable government , where companies don't
             have to worry about terrorism or have their employees live in compounds . Finally, I
             mentioned that Alaska's attractiveness is demonstrated by the large investments by
             companies such as Shell Oil who see tremendous opportunities in Alaska without the
             instability seen elsewhere in the world.

             All wanted to paint this as signs of trouble regarding Exxon's role in a gasline or AGIA, and
             commented on the escalating war of words between the state and Exxon. I played that down,
             and said we are confident that, in the end , Exxon with recognize the opportunities Alaska
             offers.

             We are currently putting together a history of changes in our oil and gas fiscal regime, going
             back 40 years . When it's done , I'll send it out so we can discuss its usefulness.

                 Joe,

                 I assume you have your blackberry with you . Exxon CEO is slamming Alaska in their analyst meeting right now. He
                 said the state lacks fiscal stability and that a producer -owned line is still the best bet . I'm not listening to the analyst call,
                 but we do have someone there and I will fill you in later . Just thought you might want to pass it along to the governor in
                 case she wants to respond . Of course, you know this is an escalating war of words that has Exxon ticked off. Give me a
                 call when you're free.

                 Sincerely,
