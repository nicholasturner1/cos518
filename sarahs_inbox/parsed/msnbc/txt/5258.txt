                    To:       Tibbles; Michael A (GOV); Governor Sarah Palin
                    Subject: Jan 31 expiration: 2 boards

                  Governor Palin and Mike,

                 Attached is a memo regarding two boards with 1 /31/07 expiration dates . Neither board requires legislative
                 confirmation and both serve at the pleasure of the governor . Hard copies will be provided , as well as additional
                 background information I have on the board members that we should discuss in person . The two boards are:

                  Libraries Advisory Council
                  Local Boundary Commission

                  I will be following up with a memo with 5 more boards with 3 / 1/07 expiration dates that do not require legislative
                  confirmation.
