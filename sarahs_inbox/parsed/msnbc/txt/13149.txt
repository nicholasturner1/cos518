            (JUNEAU ) - Today the Alaska Senate passed the state's FY 09 operating budget , House Bill
            310, after a thorough and complete review of all the spending increases proposed by the
            Palin administration.




             The Senate Finance Committee has always believed that living within our means starts with
            slowing down the growth of the state operating budget ," said Senate Finance Co - Chair Lyman
            Hoffman , D-Bethel . " We started with Governor Palin ' s version that was 17 percent larger
            than last year . After weeks of analyzing that budget we were able to trim that increase by
            nearly five percent."




            "This is a sound budget that meets the people ' s needs ," said Senate President Lyda Green,
            R-Wasilla . " However , I am still concerned about the total dollar amount . We were able to
            make reductions to the Governor ' s budget , but more will need to be made next year so that
            we can save as much of the surplus as possible."




            The Senate started its review by applying the following three principals to the FY 09
            spending plan:




            *      No new state positions unless absolutely necessary

            *      Refrain from backfilling the loss of federal funds with state general funds

            *      Curb expansion of existing programs without sound justification




            By applying these principals the Senate crafted a spending plan that curbs the growth of
            state government by $208 million and saves as much of the budget surplus as possible and:



                                                          2




                                                                                                     PRA GSP01 0013904

            *     Reduces Governor Palin ' s proposed operating budget increase from 17 percent to 11.5
            percent

            *     Slashes the number of new state government positions in the Palin administration's
            proposed budget by half from 305 to 157

            *     Turned away the expansion of state programs proposed by the Palin administration for
            a savings of $40 million




            The FY 09 operating budget uses $4 . 2 billion in general fund revenue . The operating budget
            now goes back to the House for concurrence . If the^House declines to concur with the
            Senate ' s changes a joint conference committee will be appointed to come up with compromise
            legislation.
