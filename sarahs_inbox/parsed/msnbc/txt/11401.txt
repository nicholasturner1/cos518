                 P.O. Box 10020
                 Juneau, Alaska 99811 - 0020

                 bear Director Rehfeld,

                 Please find attached our November 21, 2007 funding request to the Honorable
                 Governor Sara Palin. We have been encouraged to resubmit our second funding
                 request to you at this time.

                 As stated in our November, letter, the 2.5 million dollar request was contingent
                 upon receipt of federal funding. The amount of our federal earmark was originally
                 $916,000. The adjusted amount is now $641,000 and is, at present, being
                 challenged. We have every indication that we will receive this funding, and as such,
                 we are reducing our state funding request accordingly, to 1.9 million dollars.

                 Chris Rainwater, AACD President, and other members of AACD would like to meet
                 with Governor Palin and Commissioner Tom Irwin to discuss in detail the funding
                 request and the proposals in our November 21st letter. This meeting is very
                 important to us and we can be available to meet with Governor Palin and her staff
                 in Anchorage, Wasilla, Juneau or any place she designates, from February 18th
                 thru March 26th. Please contact our Executive Director, Eric Wade at 357-4563
                 Ext 110 in our Wasilla Office, or myself at bvehrsc gci.net, 907-892-8258/907-
                 232-6887 at your earliest convenience to set up a date if at all possible. Thank
                 you very much for your consideration.

                 Warmly, Betty Vehrs
                 AACD Revenue Committee Chair
