           Pls make sure it's publicized that the Gov's Office did NOT request the $ for pebble
           "influence" initiative (see today's ADN). In fact, Tom and I have repeatedly said publicly
           we will NOT in any way attempt to sway any ballot initiative and certainly have no
           intention on spending public dollars to influence this issue that at some point will be in
           front of voters.
