         Thank you very much. I appreciate your advice.



         I assumed everyone had their marching orders from Monday on, as the leg liason group was
         in on helping craft the press release - they were even physically in the Anchorage office
         helping with the issue before heading back to Juneau - and they seemed anxious to have all
         ducks in a row before releasing, so it took a few days longer than expected to get the
         presser out.., but obviously I should never assume, and this week was full of lessons
         learned.



         Ditto for media comments on the fellas this week. Lessons learned.



         Thank you Larry. Kris just said again the other day after speaking with you that she, too,
         is thankful you're working with us, for Alaska. Don't hesitate to advise, we appreciate
         it.



         Ahhhh, what a week . Of lessons learned.

         Governor,



         OK, it's Saturday morning and I'm full of opinions. So I might as well share them.

        Mike/ Russ /Randy: Holy moly - Kyle Johanson's comments are as biting as Bert Stedman's were
        (in adn this morning). When did you guys talk to them - when the presser was first crafted
        on Monday? Why do they say they were shocked yesterday?

        Bert didn' t sound as angry as " shocked" when I talked to him yesterday, but even that
        surpsrised me because I'm assuming this was communicated to him at the beginning of the
        week.

         Also , as Sharon knows , the Stevens story grew legs NOT out of any "demand " I made for him
         to talk to Alaskans , as KTUU reported last night . When asked three times in two days by
         different reporters if I thought Stevens should talk about the investigation, I did say I
         thought Alaskans want to hear any information he can provide , and it's appropriate and
         deserved to give him the benefit of the doubt - and Alaskans get frustrated when he can't
         or isn't providing information on his innocence.



         It's very clear the adn reporter made my comments sound more inciteful than necessary. AP
         report was more in context, but the headline was rough. I'm not "demanding" Stevens do
         anything, just as I'm not "demanding" state senate leadership strip Cowdery of Rules - I
         won't tell anyone what to do and I don't have the authority to do so anyway. These
         questions have been impossible to avoid and I'll continue to give my opinion, but it's
         unfortunate the Stevens comment is made to sound more controversial than I intended.
