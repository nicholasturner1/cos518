             Shoot sorry- the reason I wanted to move Hickel was so that I'd have tuesday morning to
             get errands done for Christmas... The commissioners will have to meet w me tomorrow - I
             assume a teleconf will do if they can't all make it to Anchorage office by tomorrow.
             Thanks

             Cook (his office).



             Also on Tuesday, Dec. 18 if you are available we were going to have                  Privilege come into the
