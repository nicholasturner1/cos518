                 Subject: Fairbanks railroad dispute

               Governor:
               There is a heavily disputed issue in Fairbanks regarding re-alignment of the track to Fort Wainwright. A group of
               citizens led by Bob Thomas called the "Rail Safety and Development Group" opposes the project and wants a
               different route for a realignment. The group angrily disputes virtually every fact with Railroad management and
               the Railroad Board.

               The group is demanding a meeting with the Governor's office and feels that if the Governor agreed with their side,
               an order could be issued to the railroad and its Board to stop the Fort Wainwright project. I have spoken to the
               leader, Bob Thomas, and offered to meet with him and the group in a few weeks.

               The whole dispute could be moot. The project only has $12 million in federal funding available. This is enough to
               finish the environmental document, but not enough to start construction. If the ARMY and DOD do not
               appropriate more funding, (and no funding was made available in the most recent federal budget bill) construction
               will never occur.

               I am giving some talking points and a "true" and "false" fact sheet put together by the Railroad to Janice in case
               you would like to read them.

               (The Fairbanks newspaper may have a story or editorial on the issue in this weekend 's paper).
