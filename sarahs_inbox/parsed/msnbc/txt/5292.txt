                                 Wagoner Calls for Hayes Impeachment
                                                 Resolution Directs House to Begin Trial

                JUNEAU-Sen. Tom Wagoner, R-Kenai, will introduce a resolution Monday directing the State House
                to begin an impeachment trial to remove indicted University of Alaska Regent James C. Hayes.

                "I thought long and hard before I decided to go through with the resolution to impeach Regent Hayes. I
                have met the gentleman, I have served with him on the postsecondary commission , I like him as a
                person, but when the university is put in the position that they have a regent who has been indicted by
                the federal government, I think that casts a pall over the whole Board of Regents and the university
                administration," Sen. Wagoner said.

                The resolution refers the matter to the House of Representatives for a trial on impeachment for the
                removal of Mr. Hayes from the University of Alaska Board of Regents.

                The resolution states that the Senate finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Hayes has
                committed an impeachable offense by his unauthorized use of the University of Alaska Seal to secure
                funding for his personal benefit and use, and by being unable or unwilling to carry out his duties to the
                University of Alaska as demonstrated by his past and continuing absences from the meetings of the
                Board of Regents.

                A federal grand jury in Anchorage has indicted Mr. Hayes on multiple counts of theft, conspiracy and
                money laundering, charging that Mr. Hayes and his wife improperly diverted $825,000 from federal
                grants that were supposed to go to LOVE Social Services Center.

                Hayes' 8-year appointment to the Board of Regents expires in 2011, and he has stated he intends to
                serve out his term.

                "I think the right thing for him to do would be step down. If he isn't willing to do that, then I am willing
                to go the last step we have, and that's an impeachment resolution and start the impeachment process,
                because nobody should be allowed to sit in a seat when they have this much controversy surrounding
                them dealing with the Board of Regents. I just don't think that's right," Sen. Wagoner said.
