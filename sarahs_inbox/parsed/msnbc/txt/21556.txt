               Ok boss, Pat and I are getting nervous that you haven't responded or provided any
               feedback.  If you don't like our approach, we can go back to the drawing board tonight.
               Tomorrow will be a busy day, though, and we want to get it in for Friday.

               Joe and I are done with a draft and will send it in 5 minutes.

               PS: Beth will be fine and ready to work with us beginning tomorrow. Thank you for calling
               her, it went a long way.

               I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the
               works.  So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don 't know if
               something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




               Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
               this was a major rush job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my
               thoughts, for what they are worth, based upon your original draft.
