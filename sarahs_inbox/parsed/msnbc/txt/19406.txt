           Dear Bruce



            I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT .......... I believe Gov. Palin and Commission Irwin

           and Alaska's will come through with a new Legislature to will allow Alaskans

           to drill and produce and profit for the first time since statehood.



           I KNOW WHAT YOUR THINKING AND NO I AM NOT DREAMING.



           I have great news It seems Mr . Joe Balash has been directed by Gov. to set

           up a meeting with us "would be profitable competitors". I have asked the

           Gov. to hire Jerry Hodgden to consult with the Her and her staff to show how

           the Kansas model can cure the. many anti competition laws put on the books.



           WHAT IF GOVERNOR PALIN HIRES JERRY HODGDEN TO CONSULT ALASKA ELECTED LEADERS

           HOW TO ADOPT KANSAS OIL AND GAS LAWS THAT ALLOWS COMPETITION WITH THE

           MAJORS.




           KANSAS      DOES NOT PRICE IT'S CITIZENS OUT OF THE OIL AND GAS DRILLING AND

           PRODUCING AND SELLING OIL AT A PROFIT BUSINESS. KANSAS DOES NOT KILL SMALL

           OIL AND GAS COMPETITOR WITH RED TAPE SO THE MAJORS CAN CONTROL THE MARKETS

           IN MY OPINION!!



            IF THIS HAPPENS THEN WILL YOU HAVE FAITH THAT PALIN TRULY CARES ABOUT

           ALASKANS BEING ABLE TO DRILL FOR OIL?



           I would not give up on Governor Palin because she is great and I predict she

           will make Alaska the largest producing oil state in the nation with small

           independents making this happen also I predict Gov. Palin be President one
                                                                 1
