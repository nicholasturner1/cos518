             Subject: The Bridges
             We have combined with the DC Representative for the Knik Arm Bridge and
             Toll Authroity and Ketchikan to oppose the Kirk amendment, which would
             prohibit the use of federal funds for either project.

             In doing so, we are emphasizing the points contained in the white paper
             written by you in conjunction with this office. The attached memorandum in
             behalf of Knik and Ketchikan includes the State's arguments and also
             forwards the white paper to members of the House Appropriations
             Committee.

            For several reasons I am not confident that we will prevail in the House.
            However, we want to give a good account of ourselves and lay the basis for a
            better result in the Senate and a subsequent Conference Committee on the
            Transportation appropriations bill.

            We will keep you apprised of further developments.
