  Tom -

  Nice to talk with you this morning - enjoy the warmth! Just to confirm we have the Dolly Parton
  Imagination Library Group that will be coming into Anchorage and presenting an autographed book by
  Dolly Parton to the First. Gentleman, Todd Palin on Thursday, and 05.22.08 at 11:30 a.m. This will take
  place in the Governor's Anchorage Office - 550 West 7th Avenue - Atwood Bldg., 17th Floor.

  I will get the paperwork from Colleen that we had discussed. Thank you again,

  Janice Mason, Scheduler
