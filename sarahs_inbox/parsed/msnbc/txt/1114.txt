 I just read with interest of your delivery of your fifth child - congratulations! There is a special place in
 heaven for you. Since you knew ahead of time that Paxson would face special challenges, it is so
heartwarming to read of a professional woman who puts this gift from God ahead of all else. May
God continue to bless you, your husband, and the children He has entrusted in your care. Sincerely,
just a regular citizen from North Carolina, and mother of four.
