         Ken Coleman is at the BAC and creamery Corp meeting out here. He has time tomorrow
         afternoon and some on Thursday if we still want to get a face-to-face meeting on long term
         efforts.  They may have resources to be brought to bear, particularly for the task force
         effort.  By the way, Kristan has announced the task force as something the governor is
         putting together.
