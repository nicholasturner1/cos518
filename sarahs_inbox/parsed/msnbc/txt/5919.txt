        I thought Franci did a good job in the dairy farmers meeting today and the rally was
        great.



        Mike in your work with the new board I need at least two or more good names to interview
        for Ag director. I hope Franci is on the list. It would sure help me if this could be an
        item for tomorrow's new board meeting. Thanks Tom

        See the energy Franci provides?! She'd be so good on the team - get her a great deputy
        and staff around her and her leadership as Ag Director will be awesome.
