            Dear Sarah,




            If you were really wanted to work for us folks that pay taxes and your wages, it would
            have helped every one, if you had worked on the school vouchers, home school or even put
            the money towards private, military, and christian schools.




            Our teachers should get what they are worth and how much have they donated to teaching
            ZERO.




            I do not see young folks at Wal-Mart count money back, they do not care in their
            attitudes-low moral.  What school do your children go to?
                                                                1

           I know it was wrong too to get Canada in on our GAS LINE.




           There are times you act more like a socialist then a Republican.

                Governor.
                So far, I have you down on Wednesday, Sept. 3, with a USA Today panel and the National Review.
                Cal Thomas would like to speak to you Monday night or Tuesday. He's interviewing other governors on Monday -
                Jindal, Pawlenty among them. Thomas has a mid-day filing deadline on Wednesday, so he's hoping to speak to
                you as soon as possible. He says he could meet you for an early breakfast Tuesday, or you could make yourself
                available immediately following your speech to the convention that evening. Please let me know by tomorrow if
                you like either of those scenarios.
                -Bill

                 Subject: Convention in Minneapolis

               I will be leaving to attend the Convention on TUESDAY August 26. I am a delegate
               and on the Rules Committee, which is requiring me to be there prior to the official
               start.

               I will have my State computer, Ken will have his cell phone Privileged                and I'll have
               the BB thing in my purse.

               In all, I'll be out of the office August 26 through September 6.

               AFL-CIO Speech: I gave Kate Morgan some bullet points for your AFL-CIO spe ech
               which I believe is August 27. Governor Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
               Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              Privileged or Personal yode Deputy Commissioner Kevin Brooks to be at
              the event, I can have him attend. I would be there, except my travel to
              Minneapolis had already been arranged when I found out you were speaking.

               DPS/PSEA: I think things have quieted down for a bit.

               WORKING GROUP: We have scheduled another working group meeting. In JNU, we
               had 6/8 very qualified applicants for the administrative assistant position in my
               office. I do think the word about salaries is getting around. We'll have an update for
               you soon on our successes so far, the next topics and the cost of the effort.

               Looking forward to hearing your speech, Governor.
