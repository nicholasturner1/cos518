          Governor - I will contact the appropriate folks on Monday to ask in regards to your
          speaking times and find out on payment of travel. I will then get corresponding flights
          pulled that we can look at. I will have a scheduling report to you shortly in regards to
          the upcoming week. Trying to work on laptop from home today (which is extremely slow).
          Janice

          The plan that    seems to make most sense should be to find out exactly when my speech is
          (two speeches    total)... then to travel a day before and a day after that main speech. I
          don't want to    be there five days, no need to. Todd won't be able to go, it appears. So
          Trig won't be    going, all the more reason to keep the trip short.

             I don't need staff besides Kris - we need to remember the GOP, for the most part...
          especially the AK machine ... has not had any support or assistance provided our
          administration so our time and efforts will continue to be spent on serving Alaskans, not
          party politics.

              Pls also find out who pays for the trip. Thanks
