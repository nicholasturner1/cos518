             Governor:



             AMHS has provided a large part of the ferry schedule to the Milepost and other magazines
             so publishing deadlines can be met. AMHS will continue working with the publishers to
             make sure the remaining parts of the schedule are provided on time.



             Randy

             Good Morning Andy & Claire!



             I have attached an excel file that lists the Summer 2008 schedules for Prince William
             Sound , North Lynn Canal , Northern Panhandle ( Village Route ), Metlakatla , and Sitka &
             Petersburg ( FVF Fairweather ). Later today I will provide you with the tariff tables.
             Schedules to follow as they are completed are: Southwest and the Aleutian Chain, Cross-
             Gulf and the Mainline Southeast Route . These will be available prior to January 30th.
