           MESSAGE:

           First of congradulations on the recent addition to your family. As a parent and
           grandparent, I think that you have been able to meld both a public life as well as a
           family. I have a grand son who has autisim, and you story touched me as far as you are
           helping not only the folks of your state, but the whole counrty to become more aware of
           the challanges that parents as well as grandparents face. Best of luck in all that you are
           doing.. . .Roger
