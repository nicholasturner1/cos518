             MESSAGE:

             Dear Sarah: Congratulations to you and your family on the birth of Trig who is most
             beautiful and adorable!



             I live in Edgerton,Kansas (Greater Kansas City Area). I was a resident of Alaska (the
             Valley & Anchorage) for 11 years, working at the Alaska Native Medical Center, Registered
             Nurse. I moved back to Kansas as my family lives here. Wanted to make it easier for my
             children if something happened to me as they are self-employed. I am 65 plus by the
             calendar, but don't want to admit it and am still working (most think I am 50).



             Sarah, several weeks ago I joined the group "Draft Sarah Palin for Vice President". Wear
             my GOP Button McCain/Palin; my car displays "Draft Sarah Palin for Vice President;"
             "McCain/Palin".

             Jump at every chance to campaign for you, which is usually everyday.Contacts get E-mails
             from me, also, the 2 talk-radio shows in Kansas City (Darla and Shanin & Parks).



             I vision Sarah Palin 4 years as vice President and 8 years as President, our first woman
             President.



             Sarah, you are the prescription our country needs.


                                                                  1
