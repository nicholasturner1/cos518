           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin -




           I saw you on the Glenn Beck program last night and I just wanted to let you know I think
           you are a super governor. The State of Alaska should be very proud and honored to have
           someone of your charactor represent their state.  Would you consider moving to Texas and
           running for Governor? Keep up the wonderful work.
