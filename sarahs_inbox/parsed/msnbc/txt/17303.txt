            We have not received the press release, yet. I will contact Kristin and see if it's on its way.

            Depending upon the message , we may be better off just placing a call to the News-Miner.

            Thanks,
            Meg

            Governor - I do not know the answer on the Chitina issue - John Bitney has been working on that


            Regarding Fox Springs - DOTPF and DEC have worked on a press release on this issue that
            Meghan has, I believe - following is an email I received from Kristin Ryan this morning -
            hopefully this will help diffuse some of the negative comments regarding the change - the good
            news is the folks will still have access to this public water system -


            Karen -

           DOT plans to keep the system operational for the remainder of the year
           (and next if need be ) while the work group comes up with a permanent
           solution . Mary Siroky is coordinating DOT's efforts . So, the answer is
           there will be no immediate impact from the reduction . DOT will continue
           to operate the system for the short term ( utilizing other funds) but in
           the future it may very well be managed by someone else in the business
           of providing safe drinking water.

           We have tentatively set our first meeting for April 5th in Fairbanks.
           Have individuals interested in participating contact Camille Recknagle
           907-269 - 7644 or Camille Recknagle @dec.state . ak.us. She'll keep them
           posted about the topic.

             We have drafted a press release for the Gov's office on the issue which
             is floating about somewhere.

             Thanks, Kristin

             My understanding is a $200g bridge repair project should allow our fishermen the access they need to
             dipnet.
