           MESSAGE:

           Dear GovernorPalin -




           I am writing from Michigan after recently reading an Associated Press feature on you and
           your husband recently welcoming your fifth child, Trig. I understand that Trig was born a
           special needs child and that you and your husband were made aware of that condition during
           your pregnancy.  The theme of the AP article I read was the two of your "Well, why not
           us?" philosophy.




           My wife and I also have five children, I am the co-founder of a busy business law firm and
           our lives are very busy and hectic. We are also pro-life advocates, having served on the
           local and state level of Right to Life issues for the past twelve years.




                                                               I




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01 0022901

            The point of this correspondence is to congratulate your family on the new addition and to
            thank you and your husband for taking the opportunity to serve as such pro-life role
            models, given your prominent political position and the demanding daily responsibilities
            expeceted of each of you. To hear that you have been mentioned in conversation concerning
            Sen. McCain ' s candidacy is refreshing and a compliment to you and your convictions.




            Good luck to you and your family as your son is welcomed aboard. Thanks again for not
            shying away from your family's pro - life stance . It does make a difference.




            PS I have visted your wonderful state for a 1 week trip 10 years ago and enjoyed an
            exciting salmon fishing trip out of Juneau. My wife and I hope to make it back some day.
            It is spectacular.




            Sincerely,




            Donald E. Duba, Esq.
