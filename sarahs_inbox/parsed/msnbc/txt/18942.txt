           Pat and Mike- in all our discussions about where to announce the pfd, I never heard that
          the pfd corp had planned a dinner in fairbanks, and that the expectation was for them, not
          me, to announce.



           It's embarrassing to think we planned an event "out from under them" - was it
          inappropriate, and was I not supposed to announce? Surely if anyone had other plans, or a
          better idea, I would have been told?



           I asked about this because I'd never paid attention to how the announcement was put
          together in the past, except tp have noticed it was usually at a formal dinner where most
          Alaskans wouldn't be able to participate, hence the idea I threw out there to travel to
          smaller communities for an event.




                                                                 1

           if this was " hijackiing" it or it was out of line, surely someone would have told me what
          the protocal was?
