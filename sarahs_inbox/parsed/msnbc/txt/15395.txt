              This is a follow- up to our request to have Governor Palin attend the Wasilla Community Safety and
              Environmental Festival presented by the North America Outdoor Institute and. the Mat -Su Health
              Foundation on Saturday May 31st at 10 a . m. in Wasilla . The festival is attracting attention locally and we
              feel will help bring awareness statewide to the importance of kicking off summer safely . We will provide
              instruction, training and interactive games and activities on a variety of topics all Alaskans take part in
              during the summer months such as bicycles, AN and water...

              We would like to have Governor Palin provide a short welcome speech (at 10:15 a.m. - Denali
              Gymnastics and Fitness on Wasilla Fishhook Road ) to encourage all Alaskans to become aware of the
              importance of learning more about safety and our environment.

              I'll be happy to send a full schedule upon your request . Thank you for your help and support.
