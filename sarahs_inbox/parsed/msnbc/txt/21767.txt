               Of course I will. When he found out Harris said that he was pretty fired up.

               His testimony went well too-he's a pro know, ready to do it again in the regular
               season ... or session.

               I heard the bills are going to the floor tonight. How exciting! And the house version will
               be the vehicle?

              Rep. John Harris is reaching too far




              Rep. John Harris, R-Valdez, needs to do the right thing and hand the gavel over to an
              objective member of the House Finance Committee. He said just a few months ago he would
              ask finance Co-Chairman Mike Chenault to hand over the gavel to Vice Chairman Bill Stoltze
              to run committee hearings should the committee be considering oil tax legislation.
              Chenault owns a construction business that has done regular oil field service work in the
              past. Harris has flip-flopped on allowing an objective Finance member chair the committee
                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0007740

             dealing with Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share oil tax plan.

             Instead of telling Alaskans why he has flip-flopped on this important issue, Harris
             compares Chenault's chairmanship to Todd Palin working on the slope. There's no
             comparison! Chenault is a lawmaker considering and evaluating oil and gas tax legislation
             that will effect our entire state. Todd is a laborer removed from any decision making.
             Harris needs to own up to his error in judgment, and not blame the Palin family for his
             mistakes.
