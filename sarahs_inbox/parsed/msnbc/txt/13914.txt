                I talked to Bob over the weekend about what we are doing with the security detail effective duly 1. He expressed
                an interest in staying on and being the link to Public Safety and assist in doing any advance work you may need
                in-state as well as any long distance coordination when you travel outside . He indicated that he would be
                interested in doing this on a minimum of a half time basis . He enjoys the people he works with and for and would
                like to stay involved in addressing your security needs.
