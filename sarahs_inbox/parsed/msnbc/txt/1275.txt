MESSAGE:

Gov Palin,



I wanted to congratulate you on your new son and to welcome you to the world of Downs syndrome.
My youngest daughter has downs and she is now 9 months old. She is our third child and she is a
pure light of God. I am delighted to see your statement on seeing the blessing that he is. Your family
will be richer for the joy of being in his presence. Like yourself, we were also prenatally diagnosed
and Sydney's arrival was nothing but joy. She was also early and we battled some minor up-front
medical issues, but she got through them and is a happy, healthy and beautiful baby girl. Blessings
to you and your family. And the best of luck in your politcal indeavors!
