           Subject:                 Email


           Kopp's dispatcher sent me an email nearly two weeks ago- it was forwarded to other depts
           but was never forwarded to me. I had to ask for it, had to track down the accuser's name,
           and had to follow up in the search for this significant piece of communication. In
           addition, many other emails pertaining to "Kopp/Sexual Harassment" were evidently sent
           over the past week, but not one was forwarded to me. This is not good- it should be common
           sense to forward these to me, especially the one from the former dispatcher involved in
           Kopp's accusations (esp with her claim in the email that she has her file of evidence and
           had wanted me to see it).

             As I have been requesting, this communication system must change. A significant email
           such as the one mentioned here that was forwarded to Boards and Commissions, special
           assistants, plus other areas should have been forwarded to me and or Talis and Nizich. If
           it was a receptionist in the receiving departments who did not know how important this was
           (perhaps she does not read the paper?) then please work with your receptionists/admin asst
           folks to instruct them on this type of issue. It really can not happen again.

             I know we get a ton of emails, but these of the Kopp/sexual harassment nature should
           have obviously been flagged though and not buried in any communication file somewhere.
           Thank you
