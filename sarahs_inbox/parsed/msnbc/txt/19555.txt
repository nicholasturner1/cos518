                 Subject: NPRA Record of Decision/Fall Lease Sale

               There are no surprises in this announcement, but the final Record of Decision does set the stage for a major
               lease sale by the BLM this fall.

               While perhaps coincidental, the BLM announcement occurs at a time when the Democratic leadership in the
               House is seeking to feature NPR-A as an essential element of its energy policy (announced last week). Critics
               counter that the BLM is already doing everything possible to lease acreage in NPR -A on an expeditious basis.

                       Record of Decision Sets Stage for Major Lease Sale in National Petroleum
                                           Reserve Alaska

                  In a Record of Decision issued today, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
                  announced that it will make land available for oil and gas leasing in the
                  northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A).

                  "This action sets the stage for a major lease sale -this fall. This is
                  welcome news at a time when Americans are paying record prices at the
                  pump," said C. Stephen Allred, Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals,
                  in signing the ROD.

                  At the same lease sale, the BLM also plans to offer land in the northwest
                  portion of the NPR A.

                  worldwide imbalance in energy supply and demand ," Secretary of the
                  Interior Dirk Kempthome said. "Developing the NPR-A in an
                  environmentally sound manner will contribute to our domestic oil and
                  natural gas supplies. Together with new production from other offshore
                  and onshore areas, these increased supplies will help stabilize energy
                  costs."

                  The lands made available for leasing under plans for NPR -A northeast and
                  northwest could result in a much as 8.4 billion barrels of oil being
                  developed. The lands could also provide trillions of cubic feet of
                  natural gas for shipment to North American markets through gas pipelines
                  currently in the planning stages.

                  'This decision provides for the protection of high value wildlife,
                  including waterfowl and caribou, and meets the subsistence needs of North
                  Slope residents while making lands with oil and gas potential available
                  for leasing," said BLM-Alaska State Director Tom Lonnie.

                  The plan includes protections for the polar bear , including requirements
                  to consider impacts on areas used by polar bears for denning.
                  Additionally, with the listing of the polar bear the agency will continue
                  to work closely with the U .S. Fish and Wildlife Service on future oil and
                  gas activities.

                  According to the Record of Decision, the BLM defers leasing for 10 years
                  on land currently unavailable for leasing north and east of Teshekpuk
                  Lake.

                  The BLM, an agency of the U .S. Department of the Interior, manages more
                  land - 258 million surface acres than any other Federal agency . Most of
                  this public land is in 12 Western states, including 80.8 million surface
                  acres in Alaska. The Bureau also administers 700 million acres of
                  sub-surface mineral estate throughout the nation . The BLM's multiple-use
                  mission is to sustain the health and productivity of the public lands for
                  the use and enjoyment of present and future generations . The Bureau
                  accomplishes this by managing such activities as outdoor recreation,
                  livestock grazing, mineral development, and energy production, and by
                  conserving natural, historical, cultural, and other resources on the
                  public lands.
