             I still like the idea of you sitting around the table with reporters on this today if you
             can. I see Gene T at 3 : 30 today. Do you want me to communicate with or ask him anything???

             Governor - I was interviewed by Dave      Donaldson , Anne Sutton , Bill McAllister , Stephen M.,
             Kristina ?? On the second floor about     the capital budget - told them there are significant
             items missing that are basic health ,     safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some
             examples like water & sewer projects     , transportation , etc...   told them the big
             differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED grants -
             approximately $ 300 million - versus state priorities . Clearly there has to be a
             responsible budget by the end and that we will continue to work toward that.



             They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental - told them we still
             have a few more meetings with legislators - that I didn ' t think we would be able to do
             much before Thursday -

             We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't let their issues
             go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are working on it.

            Governor-




            I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

            could cover budget items as well as CON.

             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list

             that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

             screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

             to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

             outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
