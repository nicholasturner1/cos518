   Subject : FW: Request for Appt.- Wayne Stevens, President/CEO AK State Chamber of Commerce
  Hello Todd,

  Wayne Stevens, President/CEO AK State Chamber of Commerce would like to meet with you to discuss
  Workforce Development issues. His original email/request is copied below. Shane mentioned that you'd
  be returning to Jnu. on Wednesday, 5/2 on the King Air. Would you like to have me schedule an
  appointment for later that week? I've responded to his request, so there's no rush to schedule an
  appointment. I didn't mean to sound so formal , by referring to you as the
  First Gentleman instead of Mr. Palin. O

  Willow and I were talking about AGIA's extra claw, let me know if you want me to schedule an appt. at the
  vet.

  Thank you,
  Erika

  4/27 Copy of Wayne Stevens response:
  Ms. Fagerstrom,
  Thank you ever so much for the assistance.
  Wasn't sure of the process and protocol.
  Regards,
  Wayne

  Subject: Protocol question

  Ms. Spencer,
  I dropped by unannounced this afternoon at the recommendation of Lt.
  Governor Parnell.
  We were visiting and he suggested that I stop by your office to ask for the
  appropriate manner
  and methodology to reach Mr. Palin.
  We were discussing Education and Workforce Development issues and
  Lt. Gov. Parnell indicated that this was an issue Mr. Palin was going to be
  working on.
  Workforce development is a high priority or the Alaska State Chamber and I
  would like the opportunity to meet with Mr. Palin to discuss the issue and
  how we might collaborate.
  Any guidance or information you can provide on how best to reach him is
  appreciated.
  Regards,
  Wayne
