                Subject : What the Hell do you do??
                What exactly does the Special Assistant to the Commissioner do? I ask this as a curious
                citizen/voter and having read your letter in the Frontiersman. The Frontiersman only described
                you as some vague Administration member and your title in the Employee Directoree is quite
                cryptic. Inquiring minds want to know. Although I don't really expect a reply. I've sent dozens
                of e-mails to this supposed OPEN Administration and have yet to receive any kind of meaningful
                response.

               It appears only my Representative Mark Neuman is the only State Official willing to answer my
               questions.
