        base with Kris today so we can coordinate.

        Crap - as usual its going to get complicated and some folks wont be as enthused as others.
        My vote and direct is june 15 in wasilla so we can at least get going on it! And we need
        another cabinet mtg anyway!



        And Mike- no more hour-plus individual presentations by cabinet members the last few have
        taken up WAY too much time.



        Kris - can you help me take it from here?
