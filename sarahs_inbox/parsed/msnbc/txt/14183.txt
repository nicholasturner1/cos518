                ADF&G Personnel, Is it true you eliminated bear baiting for sport hunters in Unit 16? If so .. Why? That
                would be entirely contrary to the decisions of the BOG in the recent meetings , and forever I believe.
                Please fix this now. Bear baiting season starts very soon, so don 't delay.
