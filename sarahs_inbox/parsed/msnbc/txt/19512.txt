         Governor, All,

         The Port Authority purchased some type of option on the Yukon Pacific Corp' (YPC) assets.
         YPC had a 1989 export license out of Valdez. However, there is NO WAY that DOE would
         allow that ancient license to proceed without undergoing another complete review and, in
         all probability it would not be approved. That is what DOE is saying - they will not
         allow the old license to be used without a review and when'they review the old license
         they won't approve it.



         Furthermore , even if DOE would approve it, Congress would pass an export ban on Alaska
         gas. This is what Senator Stevens told the Alaska Legislature and Alaska press this week
         in Juneau .  S p ecificall y, Stevens referred to US Re p Pelosi's announcement this week
         indicating the Democrats are considering an energy bill that would include an export ban
         on Alaska oil.



         Marty

        According to DOE there will NOT be amd there IS no export license! Correct me if I'm
        wrong, tom/marty... But that's what Slutz told me yesterday even. We need to get the word
        out on that one,,, also that today's Congress is also saying no license.

         Bizarre.    Almost like sending a press release out multiple times huh??



         okay bad comparison.



         anyhoo...i'm checking on that line about the export license in this ad. didn't think that
         was accurate.



         at least they're getting the "columns" right finally.
