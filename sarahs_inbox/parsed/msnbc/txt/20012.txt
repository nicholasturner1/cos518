          MESSAGE:

          As I'm sure your office normally operates at a frantic pace, the recent events in past
          days have surely added to the chaos. Writing letters (or emails) to my elected officials
          is not somthing i commonly do but i do feel if more people took an interest and acted on
          it we would see more results.




          The corruption in politics HAS to stop. i realize this is not just a problem Alaska faces
          but it is the reason I'm writing about it. You ran your campaign largely on ethics and i
          would like to see more of that take a stronger hold throught Alaska political chairs held.




          Can we PLEASE put a law into effect that would make it illegal to lie or state flase
          information in campaign ads. it should be illegal to give the public false information and
          win an election based on lies.

          don young, ted Stevens everyone knows you can't get more crooked than them. but as my
          mother always says ," you show me an honest politician and i'll show you a politician with
          no power. " its true and that needs to change . i don ' t have the answers on how to do that,
          i wish i did. but we HAVE to get this problem fixed.




          America is in bad shape, really bad shape, people would prefer to watch American Idol than
          the news. . . even though the results seem to be on the news anyway . not sure how to change
          that either (or if its even possible ) but maybe people could rally behind someone or
          something they trust.




          this rant is probably just added to a stack and i'll get a generic response if any but
          please know there are people who really care and desperately need to see a change.




          Respectfully Submitted,

              Your comment about staying sane assumes your team started out sane. I am not sure that is correct :) Appreciate
              the prayers! Tom

             They're still going and going. Just took a dinner break. Lyda exhibited her impeccable manners and drug Marty
             through her employment history for the past decade.
