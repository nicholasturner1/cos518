             Governor of Alaska

             Dear Governor Palin:




                                                                   1

             Congratulations on the birth of your son!



             I am a social worker in Anchorage. I work with families with children

             with severe emotional disturbances.



             Please expand the agenda for the upcoming      special session to include the

             restoration of Denali KidCare's (DKC) original maximum eligibility level

             of 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).




             DKC is a good bargain for the State of Alaska. The State of Alaska's

             share for both medical and behavioral health care would be only $965,000.



             DKC will save the State of Alaska money in the long run. Children without

             health care get less preventative care, have much higher health risks and

             are four times more likely to use expensive emergency room care.



             Thank you for your time.



             Sincerely,




             Joclyn Reilly
