              Governor -

              We received a call from Esquire Magazine . They would like to interview you for a column called
              "What I've Learned," which Esquire has published each month for the past ten years. It consists of
              a page of "distilled" wisdom from someone who is living a remarkable life, who has things to say,
              and who has had an impact on our culture.

              The list of past "What I've Learned " participants includes Gerald Ford , Jimmy Carter, Muhammad
              Ali, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Sen. John McCain , Christopher Reeve, Rudolph Giuliani, Julia
              Child, Ray Charles, Robert McNamara, Buzz Aldrin , Lucinda Williams, Mia Farrow, and many others.

              The interview would require a 90 minute commitment, completed by early September. If it all
              works out, the article would appear in the January 2009 issue.

              Thoughts?!!
