         Thanks so much John. I appreciate your review of the resos. I'll be able to look at the
         NGA agenda and proposed resolutions today - I believe Kris has them in the Anchorage

         Subject: NGA Resolutions/Summer Meeting




         We have completed our review of the proposed resolutions = for NGA's summer meeting and
         see nothing which should be troublesome to = Alaska.



         For the most part, the resolutions reflect a consensus = of opinion among staff of the
         respective Governors who sit on the NGA = standing committees. We made sure that the
         Natural Resources = Committee's resolution concerning energy policy continues to make =
         references to oil and gas and to the Alaska gas pipeline.



         Some Governors may try to circumvent the Committee = process by circulating sign on
         letters at the summer meeting. If = this occurs, and you have any questions about the
         subject matter, please = don't hesitate to call.




         Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
         <mailto:jwkatz@alaskadc.org> jwkatz@alaskadc.org. = Thank you .
