            Frank,



            Hope you had a fun night with the "Bailey munchkins ." My son is 13 .  It's hard to believe
            he was once a munchin .  Am attaching some pix of his costume. Of all things... he
            decided he wanted to be a "moose nugget. " I guess he's a real Alaska boy.



           As for your questions about Rural CAP... I'm familiar with the agency ,    but not with the
           Governor ' s appointment . With my graveyard schedule ,  I've not been so good about reading
           the newspaper thoroughly .   So I'm not sure what you're referring to.



           Is an appointment about to be made?



           Thanks,



           Rhonda
