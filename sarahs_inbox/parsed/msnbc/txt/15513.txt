            Not sure where this fax came from on my desk (from Begich office - looks like it was sent
            friday) but ramseur's suggestion that I speak to mark over the weekend of his energy ideas
            wasn't received until this morning. Pls have steve get a copy of this. and he can get ahold
            of begich's folks on some of these ideas until a mtg can be set up. Also pls let their
            office know I did not received the fax and suggestion until today.
