              It's the one comment that is stuck in Lyda ' s mind too. She mentioned it when I was in her
              office . I'll find out where people are hearing it-but again I'm w russ-everything comes
              back to bitney.

              Subject : Bitney



              Russ says in walking the halls the universal msg he receives re: why legislators have
              chips on their shoulders , mad at us (even republicans who like us ) is based on one msg
              they heard me say through the budget process when I made my cuts: "We need an adult in
              the house.".



              Ironically , when Russ asks, he's told it's Bitney perpetuating that msg , rubbing it in and
              reminding legislators I said it . The irony is it was Bitney who gave me that line, and it
              was in either an email or a budget roll - out speech . that he . wrote that in.



              If anyone recalls . that or has that , pls let me know , as it would help turn down Bitney's
              volume on that " gotcha " issue he ' s capitalizing on and screwing working relationships
              over.
