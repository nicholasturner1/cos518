        Halcro does not tell the truth. So I would recommend someone records the meeting.

        The meeting is set for 4pm today at Stevens International Airport. I don't

        believe that I mentioned who exactly will be there, but probably mentioned

        some for the same reason. Just so that you know, those will be participating

        on our end include Lieutenant Governor Parnell, Commissioner Irwin, Deputy

        Commissioner Rutherford, and Antony Scott. We've got two hours set aside.

        It's amazing the bs that is being spewed by Halcro . Whatever he's being fed

        to fuel his anti-Agia rants is so off base as to almost be comical.



        If he's taken up Meg ' s offer to finally meet with us to hear facts, then

        let's take him up on it asap. Dr Anthony Scott and the other experts will

        share facts so that Halcro can not deny our offer to share factual info with

        him.




        Halcro does not need to know that we will have a number of folks there or I

        anticipate he'll then find a reason to not participate.



        Thank you.
