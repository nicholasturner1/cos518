          Governor-




          I spoke to Mike Ross a few minutes ago. He wanted to confirm what I had told Channel 2
          earlier that no one from the administration pressured Monegan about Wooten. He
          specifically asked about Frank and Annette.  Walt is going to name them on the 10.



          I told him that I would go on camera or at least do a phoner. I also offered up Frank and
          Annette.  He said it was too late in the editing process and they will uise your clips. I
          have tried unsuccessfully all night to reach Annette. I talked with her husband, left
          message with Rachael and called her hotel - no luck.



           I made it quite clear that Walt's accusations were total CRAP.
