Governor Palin: As Department Commander for The American Legion In Alaska, It was an honor to
present you with the Blue Star Banner for your sons service in the U.S. Army. With our annual
department convention being held in Fairbanks at the end of April, The American Legion would like to
present your son Track with membership in The American Legion. All we would need is a point of
contact, address or phone number so we can have him present at our convention.



I hope you can provide me with the much needed information



For God and Country

Jim Pisa

Commander, Department of Alaska

The American Legion
