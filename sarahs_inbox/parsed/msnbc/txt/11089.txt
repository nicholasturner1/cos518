              Fyi. Don't know where Nizich is on that press opening. I have to assume                      doesn't want
              Privileged or Personal Material Ro for
                                              it?

             Sarah and Todd,



             Just so you know, I was in Juneau and noticed an entry level opening in the gov's office
             as a press assistant (Lauren's old job I assume .) Anyway, I told my son Robert about it
             since his job at CITC ended with the grant funding and he is still very determined to make
             his way in this career path. He is very excited about this opening, and of course, he
             doesn't think he stands a chance of getting it. I've encouraged him to apply.



             He will apply and I hope he will get fair consideration even though he lives in Anchorage;
             he would move to Juneau if he was selected. No special favors at all, I would just ask
             that he not be overlooked because of his Anchorage address or because I am part of your
             administration (which could work against him.)



             Thanks in advance for being tolerant of my over protectiveness; it is my weakness.



             Take Care, tj.
