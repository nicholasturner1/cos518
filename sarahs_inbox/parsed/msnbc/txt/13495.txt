             Governor - due to the nature of the Cabinet meeting (budget) Karen and Mike could
             definately take over the last half hour so that you and the Lt Gov can attend the ceremony
             at Ft Richardson. The event is scheduled to last approx. 30 min. Comm. Campbell will
             also be present to welcome the troops home. Janice

             I need to go to at least one of the 180 return ceremonies. I'll be reminded that as
             Commander in Chief I should be there to welcome them home at at least one of their events.
             The staff mtg can go on withouit me

            The May 1 event is the 180 ceremony which they would like you to attend. We do have
            cabinet meeting scheduled for May 1 from 11:00 - 1:00 p.m. The Lt Gov was planning to
            attend this one.  Janice .

              Their welcome home ceremony is reported on the news as April 30, but another report is
             May 1 . is one more appropriate for my attendance?
