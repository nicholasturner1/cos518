                  Subject: Energy Letter/Sunday

                 I wanted to make sure that you had the latest version of the proposed energy letter (attached). This is
                 probably the 12th version of the letter. As you'll recall, Sam has previously provided written briefings and
                 updates.

                 I don't know what the dynamics will be when the Governors get together. For me, this has primarily become an
                 academic exercise that will most likely have little impact on federal policy. In order to resolve
                 substantial differences among Governors, the draft has become progressively less sharp in expression.

                 Please let me know if I can help further: Hope you're having some fun.

                     Attached please find the latest version of the NR Committee Energy letter. Copies will be provided to your
                     governors at the Governors Only session on Sunday, July 13.

                    The only changes to the letter are the addition of compromise options and language addressing oil shale
                    that was agreed to by Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.
