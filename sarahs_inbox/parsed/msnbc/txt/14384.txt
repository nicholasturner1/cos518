                Dear Commissioners,
                I certainly hope the Regulatory Commission of Alaska will look very, very closely at AEL& P's enormous rate
                increase request. An increase that according to all intuition, reason and common sense is way too much and
                appears to provide AEL&P, a private corporation , with excess revenue in their bank account.
                Thank you for your careful attention to this very serious matter.
                Alan R. Munro, Juneau , Alaska
