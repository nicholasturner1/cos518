  Subject: Windor Restoration Schedule
 Hello Todd and Governor,

 The contractor needed to revise the original schedule submitted, so I've attached the new one. Please let
 me know if you'd like to make any changes, or I'll assume that it's fine as is. I've already sent a copy to
 Kari.

 I don't foresee any complications with this project, but my goal is to keep the contractor working through
 and around as many events or family visits as possible- just to provide a buffer zone in case we do run
 into any issues. The contractors are aware that your schedule does determine their work schedule, so it
 isn't a problem if you need to make any requests.


 Thank you,
 Erika
