                 Subject: water/mining initiatives

               We just sent the press release out on the government funding of elections initiative . They have enough signatures
               to get on the ballot.

               Also, we will soon release the same news on both 07WATR and 07WTR3, the so called "clean water" initiatives.
               Whether those will go to the ballot depends on the outcome of the litigation . Bottom line, they have enough
               signatures to qualify . (Still CONFIDENTIAL until the press release goes out since we have to notify sponsors.)
