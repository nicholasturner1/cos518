         Dear Marty and the gasline team:




         In an ad titled "Alaska? or Canada?" we listed those known for their support of a cross-
         Canada gasline.




         After sending an advance copy to legislators, it was pointed out that including "The
         Corrupt Bastards Club" implied that others,



         including you, are corrupt. That was not intended, and we apologize. That reference has
         been deleted from the newspaper



         version of the ad (see attached).




         Malcolm Roberts, coordinator, Backbone III
