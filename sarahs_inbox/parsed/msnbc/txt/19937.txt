          Is Saturday's First Spouses event at the Gov's House a FF event? ie. would Piper be
          invited to that?

               Dear Ms. Rosso:

               Thank you for your email. I certainly understand your concern for the impact of high energy costs on
               school budgets. The legislature did include some additional funds for school districts in the recently
     I         passed budget to help with these costs. Governor Palin's resource rebate legislation and several other
               ideas are being debated by legislators in special session . You may wish to provide testimony to the
               House or Senate Finance Committees or to your district legislator regarding energy costs for school
               districts.

               This issue is of vital importance to all Alaskans. We are hopeful that there will be some relief provided
               during this special session as we work on long -term solutions to bring down the cost of energy in our
               state . Thank you again for writing.

               I ask that you consider the energy rebates for all children age 16 and under be given to local
               school districts. School districts must receive energy assistance. School district budgets have
               been hit hard by gas and diesel increases.

               Consider that rural school districts are paying $5+ a gallon for fuel to run the generators that

               power the lights and heat for the village or town school. Schools also serve as community centers.
               Generators must run twelve hours a day minimum usually.

               Consider that the larger school districts like Anchorage , Fairbanks, Mat-Su and Juneau transport
               students over many road miles. Utility costs have also increased. The energy cost is now way over
               what districts originally budgeted.

               A family with four children needs assistance for their schools. Do they need four rebates all to the same
               household, or could the rebates be more effective at the school level? Setting the age at 16, allows for
               rebates to go to 17 or 18 year olds who may be driving, or who may even be working.

               If school districts do not receive extra help, the added costs will reduce school budgets for educating our
               youth - and this is not acceptable.

               Thank you for your leadership on this,

              What time is saturday's energy speech in Juneau?
              It's too late now for me to rearrange again the kids travel back to Juneau with me today so hopefully I
              can work on that for the next couple of days so they can join me in Juneau soon. I had not known that
              there were numerous opportunities to have them participate this week in any First Family events.
              PIs sched that pre-school reading visit, Spouses Tea that should include First Family as hosts, etc. That
              should suffice for their trip back to the Gov's House during the end of this special session to join me in
              Juneau.
              I don't know if I'll have time to tour the ship tonight as I'll not be arriving at the office until late
              afternoon.
              Pls check on king air for August. Thanks

               The Senate schedule is very uncertain and will not firm up until after the Senate has their caucus meeting on Monday
               morning (@ 11:00am, I'm told). Therefore I think whatever date works for you for your Cabinet meeting will be fine. I do
               want to reiterate the message Tom sent to you last night, that we do need you here in Juneau early next week to start working
               Legislators before the. AGIA vote. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do for you.
               Thanks for checking on the schedule.

               Juneau. It's a historic week if the AGIA vote is taken, so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that (and in support of AGIA
