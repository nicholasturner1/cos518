         Thank you governor! That was hard work and you made a lot of tough decisions! Hope the
         dust settles soon and we can move on! Karen

         Amen. Man, we struggle with getting the reporters to "get it"... I need to concentrate
         more on writing the story for them so they don't miss the point. Sean also made errors in
         the story re: what was actually vetoed vs just reduced.



         At least the editorial kinda/sorta understood where we were going on the capital. No
         mention of pers/trs, savings, muni sharing, etc tho.



         I'm proud of what we did through this process, Karen. You and Joan were amazing. Thank you
         so much for all your great work!!!

          For me, the most frustrating aspect of the veto news stories is the comparison of the
          capital budget vetoes to the operating budget vetoes. What the public doesn't see or
          understand is the budget discipline you exercise during the crafting of the operating
          budget.   Privilonorl or Porennnl Mnforiol Pationforl
         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




          The fact that the operating budget was not subject to public vetoes at this point in the
          process was in large part because the Governor kept a tight ship during the formation of
          her budget.



          Just my observations.
