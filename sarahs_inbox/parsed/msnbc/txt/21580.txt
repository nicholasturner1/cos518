              Thanks- I thought he surely was being sarcastic and I told Tibbles that folks had better
              quit bad- mouthing Bruce, as I'm the one requesting Bruce's assistance on ACES messaging.

             I guess not, although most of us did not know Russ either. We will make sure he meets DNR
             people when they go to Juneau and I will ask Russ to stop by when he is in Anchorage and
             we will take him around and introduce him.

             Does Russ really not know Bruce Anders?

               Pls format it or I can do it myself.



              And who's Bruce Anders? He works for DNR, I asked him to look at the op-ed for me to add
              anything important, and he did so. Did you really not know who he was?

              Too late to do any good at this point, but I will mention it in my travels and let them
              know it's up.

               Does Russ want to format this into letter from me to leggies? And run it through
              signature machine to hand out asap, before they read on line.
