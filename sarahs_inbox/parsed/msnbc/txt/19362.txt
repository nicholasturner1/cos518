          Ok. Rather than another from this office I'm trying to get Faircount. If they don't asap
          (today), we will.

          a letter to finally explain, in one sentence, that it was gail phillips-not you- under
          murkowski, who contracted Outside for publishing. Colleen or someone, pls have them do it
