         Great. And let us hope and pray they all take that fresh look!

         Ok, thanks. Just finished with El Paso. They plan to do the same thing--check producers'
         pulse as to whether they will reconsider their options in light of AGIA. At some point
         earlier in time, these companies were clearly stiff armed out of participation. Our hope
         now is that all parties will take a fresh look at the opportunity the AGIA environment
         presents.

          Thanks, we just came out of our meeting with Kinder Morgan. I can brief you more later,

         but it is clear that they will be calling Conoco and BP to check their pulse . Kinder
         Morgan will ask whether the cos message has changed from their comments during the
         legislative process ( ie are you guys reconsidering participating now that AGIA has passed)




           I was curious whether you had made contact with the producer cos since AGIA passage to
         say, "I heard your comments during legislative process, and hope you ' ll consider
         participating in responding to the RFA once it is out."

             Had a good talk with

             Lisa. Of interest , she has been working Village Safe Water projects too (particular
         focus on Buckland ). Very frustrated but thinks she's making progress . I am going to hook
         up my staff with hers so we can get more info and better coordinate.



             AGIA: I told her of my trip and she was happy to hear of more interest .  She raised
         concerns about tone of a PPT special session. She suggested that your message continue to
         be one of fair share relative to other jurisdictions ( and steer away from the punitive
         talk of the Dems given that we want more companies investing here ( and PPT hits more than
         just the producers ). It was a good meeting, much too short.



             On airplane for SEA now .         I will overnight there and finish to Houston tomorrow
         morning.
