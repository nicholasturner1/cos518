               I wish you and yours a Beautiful Thanks Giving and
               Christmas Holiday 2007.
               I know how much you will miss your Soldier in Training, as
               My Son Dennis was there at Fort Benning, Georgia, last year,
               and now he is up at Fort Wainwright, Fairbanks, and is
               training to drive a Stryker vehicle.

               I hope and pray for Peace, and I'm glad to be Blessed living in
               the Home of the Free, Because of the Brave.

               God Bless you and yours,

               Sincerely,
               Pamela Rene Lee,
