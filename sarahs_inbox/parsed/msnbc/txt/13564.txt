             Run it by Joe S too if MEA is using his prison as an excuse to bloat.

             Thanks Mark!     Good information.



             The more help the better in going through this disappointingly bloated budget....please give
             me your input on other projects you come across.

             Hi all:




             I noticed last night while going over the latest version of capital budget projects that
             the wording on MEA ' s request had changed to include line extensions to Point McKenzie for
             the prison . I think the amount was up, too , although I could be wrong . It's at $25 million
             now.




             I called Steve H. to find out about the det a i ls , but he 's out til                       o I called Jim
             Strandber at AEA. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted             P                ged or Personal Mater
             Privileged or Personal -M aterial   a acte




            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




             Not sure where we are on all of this,          but I thought the information might be useful.
