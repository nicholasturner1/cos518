MESSAGE:

Hi Governor Palin! I just wanted to say congratulations on the birth of your son! Yes, the happy news
even reached us here in Ohio! I know that you haven't spoken at length about the nature of your new
son's challenges, but I have read that he has Down syndrome. I hope you don't find this intrusive or
obnoxious, but I wanted to let you know that if that is so, you are in for a wonderful journey full of
great joy and pride in your child's accomplishments! My son, Drew, turns 2 in June. He was born with
Down syndrome, and while I was initially panicky about the diagnosis, he has proven at every step
that he will not be defined by his genetic material. He is utterly "normal" in terms of his development--
not a single delay yet! He has a smile that lights up the room, and a magnetism I've never witnessed
before. He literally draws people to him wherever we go, and I hope you experience the same joy
with your new baby! Good luck and congratulations again ! Kathy Layden Palmer
