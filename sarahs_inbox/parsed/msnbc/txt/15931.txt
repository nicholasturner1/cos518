           In my discussion with Rep. Doogan at the AGIA meeting, he made three statements, "this is
           not a State function", "this cannot be turned off in one-year" and "Anchorage does not
           need this relief".

          The following is an except from Rep. Doogan's June 4th ADN column:



          "This may well be the single worst public policy proposal I've seen in 30 years of
          watching state government. Among the problems are doling out money to people who are
          paying the national average for energy, footing the federal government's utility bills and
          trying to figure out how to make debit cards work in places where, well, debit cards don't
          work.



          Not to mention - although, really, I am mentioning it -- starting a handout policy that
          won't go away by itself and won't be supplanted by any long-term energy fix for many
          years. So what Palin is actually asking for is a commitment to pay more than $1 billion a
          year for an unknown number of years for something government doesn't usually pay for, like
          your gas at the pump. What next? A subsidy for people who are suffering from the
          escalating costs of tasty baked goods?"

          He wants to talk energy rebate ideas with me upon my return to Juneau on Monday-ish. He
          does want to support us but does NOT like the debit card idea. I said of course I'll hear
          him out and consider.
