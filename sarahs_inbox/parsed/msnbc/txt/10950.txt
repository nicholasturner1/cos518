               Hi Ron,
               No, I did not receive notice of the meeting , no one I have spoke to has received their notice . I really do
               believe you need to
               Give us 30 days notice for these meetings as per AS 44.62 . 190. It appears to many of us that DOT is
               trying to have SCERET MEETINGS , with only the chosen fFEW . I request that you cancel this meeting
               and reschedule with the proper notice.
               Thanks, Linda
