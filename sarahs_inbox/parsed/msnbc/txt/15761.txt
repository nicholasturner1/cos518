          Dear Governor Palin:




         Although I am not Alaskan my family and I want to congratulate on your new addition. We
         have a 3-year-old with Down Syndrome and it always wonderful to hear of a new addition to
         "our" family.




         We wish you the very best from many miles away.



         The Miller Family
