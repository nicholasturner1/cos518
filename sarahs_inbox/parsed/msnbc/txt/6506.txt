         I have no idea what you're talking about re: sharon's response, an attachment, etc. I got
         nothing except a forwarded chris clark letter from Kris perry, about a half hour ago.

         I talked to Sharon after she sent the first email with the attachment. We discussed a
         response and she typed and sent the results of the poll and the suggested language. We
         thought you had received everything. Sharon did leave a meeage for Kyle after you sent
         the message but did not hear back. we. were checking to see if he needed any
         clarification.  I think he may have already completed his story. Her comments to Kyle
         were very consitent to what you sent, other than mentioning anchorage. If he did use your
         comments, it should be OK since you were clear that you could not open the results.



         I thought it was bizzare that Beth raised the constitutional question. I heard she
         insisted that it be included and that it was her way of countering Lyda (Although I am not
         sure I got her strategy on that one).

         Did anyone know of the poll results before the reporter contacted me for my response? I
         wish I would have been told...



         Part of the story here is that Harris told the media before he bothered informing me that
                                                                 1

         he insists it's my job to call the location. Kertulla says it's not my job and may not
         even be legal for me to mandate meeting locale.

         Hi Kyle:

         I don't see the attachments, but I assume you're telling me the House polled "yes" for a
         road system (Anchorage) location. That doesn't surprise me, it's what we've been hearing
         from legislators and the vast majority of Alaskans who've weighed in on the special
         session issue.



          It's unfortunate that Senate leadership doesn't want to poll, thus be given the same
         opportunity as the House to provide input on this issue.



         It's been administration's intent all along to work with the legislature on the special
         session location issue, so the House results will have to suffice and we'll combine its
         poll with the comments received by Senators who chose to provide us input after their own
         successful special session in Anchorage. (Some have gone around leadership to give us
         input anyway.) It's obvious the majority of elected and non-elected Alaskans want a
         special session on the road system.



        Holding periodic meetings where more Alaskans may participate in our lawmaking process is
        a positive thing for our state , it's not a threat to our capital city.  I'm sensitive to
        the fact Juneau residents would no doubt prefer all meetings take place in Juneau, and I
        don't propose moving the capitol, but bringing a legislative hearing to more Alaskans to
        discuss the monumental issue of value placed on our nonrenewable resources is healthy and
        wise at this time.

         Governor,

          I know it ' s a little late in the day, but can you commment on this letter from Rep. John
         Harris on the location of the special session? In it, he says many House members want it
         in Juneau but says there is a "consensus among many House members " that you should make
         the call , not them.



          So, I guess the questions would be:



          * Have you received any input from the Senate on where the session should be?

          * Do you agree with House reps who say the governor should be the one who decides the
         location of the session?

          * How will location be decided ? Will it be the location that the majority of legislators
         want, or will it be more complicated than that?

          * When do you expect to decide where it will be?



          I'm writing a short story for tomorrow ' s paper. The letter, and Harris's poll of House
         reps are attached.



          Thanks!

          Kyle
