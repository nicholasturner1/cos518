               Hello

               Thanks for your response. I'd just like to encourage the reader of this email to have her budget/finances
               person, or her cheif of staff to read it, if not the governor herself.

               Thanks

                 Why isn't our budget surplus being used to fund a bid to host either a
                 Summer or Winter Olympics?

                 This is Alaska. We are an obvious choice for a Winter Olympics.

                 For Summer Olympics, we have several ideal locations throughout the
                 state. For example, Fairbanks often has temperatures in the 80s and 90s
                 during the summer. Even an unsuccessful bid for Summer Olympics would
                 help dispel some of the myths that our state is snow-covered year-round,
                 and that we all live in igloos.

                 Hosting the Olympics would:
                 -Bring jobs to the state in the form of construction of new
                 infrastructure, and for staffing the Olympics itself
                 -Bring more money to the state, in the form of federal aid for new
                 infrastructure, and in the form of tourism dollars from spectators
                 -Share Alaska with the world through media coverage, increasing our
                 national and international standing.
