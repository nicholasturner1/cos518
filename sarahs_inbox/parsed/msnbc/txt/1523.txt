  Erika,

  That looks good,please add that I drove personal car to Anchorage airport, roundtrip about 125
  miles. I have another parking reciept from that trip that I paid using state cc.

  Also the other parking reciepts that I gave you, I also drove personal car to Anchorage.

  Fairbanks picnic 125 mile

  I think the other reciept was for the pipeline tour with Click,you can compare dates

  Thanks Todd
