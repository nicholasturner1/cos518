            MESSAGE:

            I would like to congratulate you and your husband, on the birth of your little boy. My
            girifreind and I work with kids that have special needs and require a little more love. I
            wouldn't change a minute of time I get to spend with them. All my kids are raised
            allready, and finally I can use the patinence and lessons they taught me. I use it in a
            way that let' s me give them the love and time they deserve. Not a day goes by that I don't
            thank the big guy for the love they bring to me and everyone else 's life that crosses
            their path. Best of luck and keep up the great work.
