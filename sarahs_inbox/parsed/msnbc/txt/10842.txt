            Wow- that would be cool. I haven't heard the suggestion, but I like it. And Kris and her
            crew would be recovered from the Statehood Celebration by then: And oil/resource
            companies would no doubt love to contribute.   When do they need to know?

            Subject: NGA summer meeting/2010




           Julie Dodds of the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau has been = in touch with the
           National Governor's Association to discuss the possibilit= y of holding NGA's 2010 summer
           meeting in Alaska. In turn, NGA has = contacted me since they work with governors, not
           third parties.  =



           Julie told NGA that she has been in communication with you. = I want to make sure,
           however, that Julie' s efforts are sanctioned and = approved by the governor and you.



           Holding an NGA meeting in Alaska would have certain obvious benefits, = but it would also
           involve a tremendous amount of work. Later today, = I will forward an application packet
           which describes NGA's expectation= s. I have been told that we would need to raise
           between a million = and 2.8 million dollars depending on the scope of activities, identify
           100 = to 150 volunteers, be responsible for security and logistics, etc. = Also, we would
           probably be in competition with other interested = states.



           None of this is said to discourage our possible application. = However, before this gets
           to far down the road, I just want to make sure = that Julie's hopes are consistent with
           ours.



           Thanks for your advise on this.

                                                                   1
