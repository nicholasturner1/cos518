        Tom is the one we talked about and liked. Cora said the feedback was all positive about
        him.  The only concern we anticipate is a possible complaint from Icicle (because they are
        losing the seat) and other processors who may feel Tom's business does not represent the
        diversity of the industry.

         So we'll go with Jack Schultheis to replace Duncan Fields in the small processor seat per
        your email.



         One other question: Are we also going with Tom McLaughlin to replace Don Giles for the
        large processor seat? He's with Seafood Producer's Cooperative which has the plant in
        Sitka and is owned by Alaska fisherman. We weren't able to find any large processor ceos
        in Alaska. Cora thinks Tom is most likely the best bet of all of the large processors
        (he's from Bellingham).  This is the guy Paulette says has a good business mind.



         This is the last item to check off and then we have ASMI taken care of.

         B&C received the application and resume of Jack Schultheis today. He's the guy Cora
        recommended for the small processor seat. He's the sales manager for Kwik Pak Fisheries
        in Anchorage.  He's from Wasilla; he served on ASMI under Hickel; he's supportive of the
        good work your doing as governor; and, we received an endorsement letter from Eric Olson--
        As Cora mentioned, they work together at Kwik Pack.

         Thanks Cora. We'll need to wrap up these choices soon - Tibs and I can discuss before or
        after cabinet mtg this week. Thanks!

         Governor,

         A good possibility for a small processor is Jack Schultheis of Kwikpak Fisheries. This
        is the company on the lower Yukon that Eric Olson works for. I'm still waiting for his
        resume, but I expect to have it soon. I know he has previous ASMI board experience and
        Kwikpak has a good reputation for quality.

         You asked if we could find someone for the large processor seat who is an Alaskan
        resident.   I did some research and did not find any large processors with an Alaska
        resident CEO.   Given this, Tom McLaughlin at Seafood Producer's Cooperative is probably
        still our best candidate. He lives in Bellingham.

         FYI, Icicle announced today that they are selling the company to a private equity firm in
        California, Fox Paine Management.  No management changes are expected.
         Cora

        Thanks! Yikes - that was embarassing and now I hate to have to put my name on those race
       registration forms.



        Also- what did we come up with for small processor to fill on the board? Cora was going
       to look. Also, the replacement for Giles on the board - where did we go there?
