             Governor-



             CNN would like a few minutes with you after you deliver the Hoover Institution speech.
             They would like to talk about the Exxon case and Federal earmarks . They could meet you
             coming out of the speech at the Intercontinental . You may remember the reporter - Joe
             Johns - he interviewed you in your Anchorage office right after Pet e KULL yoL sentenced!
             Please let me know.
