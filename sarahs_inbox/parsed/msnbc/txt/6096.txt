         Dear Governor Palin,



         My name is Travis Morgan ; I am a member of Boy Scout Troop 230 located in Eagle River,
         Alaska . I am currently working on my Eagle Scout Project. My Project involves installing
         a flag pole at the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage .  I am wondering if you
         would like to help me by sending an Alaska Flag that has flown over the State Capital
         Building . The flag would be the first to climb the pole - after I have completed my
         project - and would then be given to the Museum as thanks.



         Thank you,




         Travis Morgan
