             Governor:




             AMHS has released the draft schedule for fall - winter 2008 and spring

             2009 about 8 weeks earlier than last year.




             I am working with AMHS on getting the summer 2009 schedule out about

             8-10 weeks earlier than this year. This should avoid the issues we ran

             into with the Milepost.




                                                                                                                    PRA_GS P01 _0016815

              "Chuck VanKirk and the scheduling staff's hard work means we are

              Their efforts are truly appreciated," said Beedle.
