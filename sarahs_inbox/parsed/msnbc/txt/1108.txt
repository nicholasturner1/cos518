  Governor,

  Below are the contact phone numbers for the ETS employee widows. There is no expectation for you to
  call, so the option is completely yours. The numbers below are in case you do have time to make these
  condolence calls.

  Sandy Middleton :                    ( Ed Middleton's sister-in-law and wife of victim Thomas Middleton of
  Anchorage)
  Terri Seward :            (Zed   ,d i (wife of victim Michael Seward of Palmer)
  Tracey O' Donnell :                  (wife of victim Joseph O'Donnell of Girdwood)

  I didn't include pilot Benoit Pin's family as this should be handled through his employer, Era Helicopters.
  If you'd like that as well I can get that phone #.

  I've spoken with Annette and while there was some confusion over who was communicating directly with
  the families yesterday , today that has been resolved . All families have either been contacted or
  attempted to be contacted by the Department of Administration.

  Their single point of contact with the State is Carol Beecher , Assistant to Kreitzer, cell. letdat tcd;This
  has been communicated to the families . She is working all issues relating to insurance , benefits packets,
  likely counseling ... etc.

  Frank
