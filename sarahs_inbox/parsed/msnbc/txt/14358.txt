              Governor,

              You are confirmed to attend the Alaska Native Justice Center 's "Building Momentum" conference in Anchorage on
              Monday morning. The event begins at 8 : 30 a.m . and, as it stands now, you are scheduled to speak last, at about
              9:10 (approximate time). If you arrive at 8:25 a.m., you will be seated onstage at a head table with the other
              speakers (the attendees will be finishing breakfast); if you choose to come later, you could arrive at 9:05 a . m., sit
              at the back of the room until you are introduced , take the stage to deliver remarks , and then leave the event.
              Please let me know if you prefer to arrive at 8:25 or 9 : 05 a.m. Also, if you'd like to speak first, that is also an
              option.

              Please respond at your earliest convenience . Kris will be dropping off information related to tomorrow's Bike
              Blessing as well as Monday ' s conference with you tonight . Thanks so much!
