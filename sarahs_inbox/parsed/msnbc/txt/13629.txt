                 Dear Governor Palin,
                 My name is Joanne Casqueira, I've lived in Ak for almost 30 years. I
                 raised 4 children in the small town of Big Lake.
                 Now my youngest Alexander (20 years old) is a proud member of the U.S.
                 Marine Corp. He has already been to Iraq once and is being sent back
                 again, we are all very proud of him!
                 Unfortunaly, he call me today from Camp Pennelton to see if I could
                 start some sort of "Fund-raising" for him and his troops.
                 He told me they do not have the proper equipment to fight and stay
                 alive. This broke my heart, so I started calling every buisness in
                 Wasilla asking for their help, Wal-Mart,Fred Meyers, H&R Block, Sears

                  even the Geat Alaska Pizza Company.
                  Most seem willing to help.
                  I have set. up a account for Alex and his troop through a company based
                  in Ca. called "Combact Ready " in San Clemente. Ca. (949)276-2333, Travis
                  Box or Collin Owens are in charge .Please, if you can help me, help all
                  the young men and women who fight for us and would die for us while
                  asking nothing in return I would be forever grateful . As Alaskan's we
                  need to join together to make sure these brave soldiers have EXACTLY
                  what they need to do their job, that WE sent them there to do. Please
                  Governor Palin, just take one moment to call Travis Box or Collin Owens
                  @ (949)276-2333 and they can tell what and why'OUR children need
                  Alaskans to pull together and help.
                  How sad my son a "Lance Corporal " of the U . S.M.C. had to call his
                  Mother for help, for proper "gear"
                  Thank-You Joanne Casqueira
