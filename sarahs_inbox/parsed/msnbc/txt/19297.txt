           Subject:                 Parochial school tax exemption.


           Dear governor palin. I just learned that judge Spaan have ruled in our favor in our
           arguments to support a tax exemption for parochial schools. This is the one that the
           Baptist temple was very interested in. The judge ruled that the statute for the exemption
           is constitutional.  Talis.
