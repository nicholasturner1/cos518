       So we'll go with Jack Schultheis to replace Duncan Fields in the small processor seat per
       your email.




       One other question: Are we also going with Tom McLaughlin to replace Don Giles for the
       large processor seat? He's with Seafood Producer's Cooperative which has the plant in
       Sitka and is owned by Alaska fisherman. We weren't able to find any large processor ceos
       in Alaska. Cora thinks Tom is most likely the best bet of all of the large processors
       (he's from Bellingham).  This is the guy Paulette says has a good business mind.



       This is the last item to check off and then we have ASMI taken care of.

        B&C received the application and resume of Jack Schultheis today. He's the guy Cora
        recommended for the small processor seat. He's the sales manager for Kwik Pak Fisheries
        in Anchorage.  He's from Wasilla; he served on ASMI under Hickel; he's supportive of the
        good work your doing as governor; and, we received an endorsement letter from Eric Olson--
        As Cora mentioned, they work together at Kwik Pack.

        Thanks Cora. We'll need to wrap up these choices      soon - Tibs and I can discuss before or
        after cabinet mtg this week. Thanks!

       Governor,

       A good possibility for a small processor is Jack Schultheis of Kwikpak Fisheries. This is
       the company on the lower Yukon that Eric Olson works for. I'm still waiting for his
       resume, but I expect to have it soon. I know he has previous ASMI board experience and
       Kwikpak has a good reputation for quality.

       You asked if we could find someone for the large processor seat who is an Alaskan
       resident.  I did some research and did not find any large processors with an Alaska
       resident CEO.  Given this, Tom McLaughlin at Seafood Producer's Cooperative is probably
       still our best candidate. He lives in Bellingham.

       FYI, Icicle announced today that they are selling the company to a private equity firm in
       California, Fox Paine Management.  No management changes are expected.

       Thanks! Yikes - that was embarassing and now I hate to have to put my name on those race
       registration forms.



      Also- what did we come up with for small processor to fill on the board? Cora was going to
      look. Also, the replacement for Giles on the board - where did we go there?
