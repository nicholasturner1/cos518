             Governor :



             The new draft schedule has not been submitted to publications.



             The draft schedule is open for public comment -- written through Jan. 10 (tomorrow) and
             two teleconference scheduled for Jan. 11.



             The schedule may see some adjustments based on the public comment. The final schedule will
             be available no later than Feb. 12. DOT hopes to have it available before that date.



             Here 's the link -- I'll copy Tara on this so she can print it.
