            I just forwarded the piece. Thanks for permission to send it. I gave Rosemary the
            numbers she wanted but felt that the op-ed itself is a better exposition of your position
            than my paraphrase over the, telephone would be.



            Sharon and Beth, I tried to reach you by phone. I hope that sharing the op-ed with
            Rosemary does not impair the rest of your roll-out plan. However, Rosemary's editorial
            seems to be a great means for correcting the record and accurately portraying the
            Governor's views.

            Rosemary Shinohara of the ADN just left me a voice mail asking for certain information
            about our earmarks.  She was not there when I returned her call.



            I will provide the information she wants. But, it also occurred to me that she might
            benefit from the perspectives contained in the Governor's proposed op-ed piece to the
            Fairbanks News-Miner . I said in my return message that I could provide the specific
            information she wanted but that she should contact you to see if there was something more
            we could provide.
