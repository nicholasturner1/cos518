            MESSAGE:

            I just read on my home page about the birth of your son, Trig. My oldest son, born when I
            was 24 was Down Syndrome. He was such a joy. I also have a son 39, and a daughter 35,
            but Trevor always had such a special place in my heart. Trevor passed away in 1994 from
            complications from dialysis.   A doctor told us when he was very young to treat him as near
            normal as possible.  We always did that. I remember one time, he was sitting on the floor
            and I had told him to do something. He ignored me. His daddy told him to do the same
            thing and added..... if you don't, I'll get the switch. He sat there until his daddy
            acted like he was getting up to get the switch. He then did what he was told to do. That
            was when I realized he understood a lot more than I was giving him credit for. Trevor
            loved babies and other children and loved animals.



            Your decision to not abort and to keep your child is very admirable and I am sure will be
            an inspiration to other couples.



            A new fan of the Gov. of Alaska,
