           I have just been told on a confidential basis that Secretary Kempthorne will hold a press
           conference at 2:30 EDT today to announce his polar bear decision. A press advisory will
           be issued at 11:30 EDT, but it will not specify the subject matter.



           At fpm EDT, the Secretary will call the Governor at her Anchorage office to discuss his
           decision . I'm advised that this will be the first call he will make.



           The Interior officials who contacted me could not discuss the content of the Secretary's
           decision.  However, I got the distinct impression that he will decide in favor of a
           listing under the ESA.  Accordingly, I would recommend that we complete work on the draft
           press release as soon as possible.



           Information concerning the decision will be posted on Interior's website at 2:30 EDT. In
           addition, I will be briefed and will send you what I receive.



           The officials stressed the need for secrecy until the press conference actually occurs.

           P.S.

           On Friday, the Interior Department will announce its decision concerning the Northeast
           planning area of NPR-A. Apparently, the decision will preclude oil and gas leasing in a
           sensitive area around the northern portion of Teshepuk Lake while allowing leasing further
           south.  This should not be a problem for the oil industry, which has shown no particular
           interest in the prohibited area.
