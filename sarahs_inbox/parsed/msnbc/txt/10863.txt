             Good day Ms. Holzman.



             I'm sorry that I haven't gotten to you earlier but I was out of office. Thank you for
             letting me know you haven't received notice of the up-coming workshop for the Willow Lake
             Use Plan.  I've checked with Central Region and they say all letters have been mailed and
             notices posted in Willow and published in the Anchorage Daily News. I confirmed that a
             letter was mailed to you and I hope you have now received the letter with a copy of the
             plan.



             The information you requested, complaints on lake use, will be available for you by the
             11th.  It has been a busy time and we've had people on vacation. Our clerical support
             will be back on the 7th of January so I plan on having the information to you shortly
             thereafter.

            Ron,

            I have not recieved your notice about the January 8th Lake Plan Meeting, I

            have not received a copy of your draft lake plan and I have still not

            received a copy of the written record of all complaints that you have

                                                                    1




                                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0009420

             received regarding Willow Lake that I requested last November . When can I

             expect you to send me these items? What date was DOT's notice of the

            meeting in the Daily News Paper? I checked the Willow Community Bulletin

            Board yesterday January 2, 2008 and there was no posting about a DOT

            workshop.     However, there was a notice of the WACO public meeting scheduled

             for January 7, 2008. Just curious, but when did you mail the notice to us,

             the property owners about this January 8, 2007 meeting? It makes one wonder

            why you would plan a meeting and not notice the interested parties in a

             timely manner! Why does DOT continue to keep us in the dark?           If not for

            James Riley we would not know of your DOT meeting.

            Again, please send me the written record of all the complaints that you have

             received regarding Willow Lake, this includes, phone calls, emails and

            written complaints as this is public information.

             Thanks, Linda-Lou
