           Subject:                  Gara's gun issue


          Walt- we'll ask you to chime in on Gara's proposal re: the gun issue in today's ADN when
          we all can sit down to discuss the issue.



          The first thought that hit me when reading Gara's quote about people not being able to buy
          guns when they're threatening to kill someone went to my ex brother-in-law, the trooper,
          who threatened to kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this
          day carries a gun, of course. We can't have double standards. Remember when that death
          threat was reported, and follow-on threats from Mike that he was going to "bring Sarah and
          her family down" - instead of any reprimand WE were told by trooper union personnel that
          we'd be sued if we talked about those threats. Amazing. And he's still a trooper, and he
          still carries a gun, and he still tells anyone who will listen that he will "never work
          for that b*itch" (me) because he has such anger and distain towards my family.



          So consistency is needed here. No one's above the law. If the law needs to be changed to
          not allow access to guns for people threatening to kill someone, it must apply to
          everyone.



          Hopefully we'll all meet on this soon, as Gara will be expecting a response soon.
