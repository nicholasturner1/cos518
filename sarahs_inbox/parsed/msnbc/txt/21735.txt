               I gave some thought to the Lieberman bill last night. I think we could actually have
              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

                  After sending this, I though that you might also be interested.



                  There's nothing new here, and I doubt that anything more will happen. However,

                  I wanted you to be aware of the current situation.

                  Were working with the remnants of Arctic Power and others to promote some
                  counter battery fire.


                  ANWR: Lieberman renews bid for permanent drilling ban
                  A quarter of the Senate has signed on to keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
                  off-limits to oil and natural gas drilling.
                  Backed by a group of 25 senators, Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) introduced a bill
                  today that would designate the coastal plain of the Alaskan reserve as an official
                  wilderness area , thereby precluding any oil and gas activities.
                  "America's strength is not in our oil reserves but in our reserves of innovation,"
                  Lieberman said in a statement. "The answer is not to drill in our national
                  treasures but to increase our energy efficiency and find alternative and renewable
                  sources of energy."
                  All 26 sponsors are Democrats, excluding Lieberman and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-
                  Vt.).
                  The coastal plain is currently off-limits to drilling rigs, but Lieberman and other
                  lawmakers want permanent protection. Legislation in 1980 that expanded the
                  Arctic preserve deferred a congressional decision on managing energy resources
                  on the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain.
                  Alaskan lawmakers and others seeking to boost domestic production have long
                  sought to tap an estimated 5.7 billion and 16 billion barrels worth of oil in the
                  region . Republicans came close to opening the area in the last Congress after
                  expanding their majority in the 2004 elections but fell just short.
                  The ANWR issue is not wholly partisan, with several pro-drilling Democrats in
                  favor of development and moderate Republicans having sink efforts to open the
                  reserve in the last Congress.
                  Opening the area is not on the table under the Democratic leadership of
                  Congress. At the same time, permanent protections are also considered quite
                  unlikely given the difficultly associated with getting the 60 votes needed to pass
                  such a measure.
                  Reps. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jim Ramstad (R-Minn .) introduced House
                  legislation in January to designate the coastal plain as a wilderness area. House
                  and Senate legislation to create permanent protection has also been introduced in
                  previous sessions of Congress.
