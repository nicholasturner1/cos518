                                                     PUBLIC NOTICE
                This case has exposed Alaska State Troopers, prosecutors, and defense attorneys that have
                misled an Alaskan court to intentionally deprive a citizen of due process or a fundamentally
                fair trial. Your attendance is being requested at oral arguments which have been set for
                May 8, 2008 1:30 p.m.

                Defendant David Haeg asks you read the attached Reply Brief and Supporting Caselaw and
                then attend the Court of Appeals Oral Arguments in Anchorage . They will be held in the fifth
                floor courtroom of the Boney Courthouse building at 303 K. Street . Each side is allotted 30
                minutes.

                This case is serious enough the U.S. Department of Justice has formally asked for all past,
                present, and future documentation.

                If you want to know "the other side of the story" the State's Appellee Brief (and others) are
