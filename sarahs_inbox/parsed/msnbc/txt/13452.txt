            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on your new baby. May you, your baby, and all your family be blessed
            abundantly.   What a beautiful example you are for everyone. No one is perfect, we all
            have defects of one kind or another. You have shown to everyone that each life is
            precious.   God bless you,

            Sincerely,
