           Governor,



            From the oil and gas perspective, attached are the talking points for your three national
           interviews this week.



            As I am sure others are working on, all three may ask a range of questions from abortion
           to.guns and oil.  The attached only discusses oil and gas issues.



            Glenn Beck (CNN) probably has the greatest chance of launching into numerous issues.  He
           loves to make fun of everyone and is incredibly good natured. You should laugh a lot with
           him.  He has a couple children and recently adopted one, if not two, children. Glenn is
           pro-drilling, pro-oil.  You both should see eye-to-eye other than he doesn't feel people
           should always pick on the oil companies.



            Larry Kudlow (pronounced KUDD-low) is with CNBC and Kudlow & Company. His energy mantra
           is, "Drill. Drill. Drill." and doesn't understand why the Presidential candidates don't
           get it. On Monday, CNBC is launching a full-day show re: historical meetings with Saudi
           Arabia tomorrow.  In my opinion, your interview with Kudlow will be all oil and gas.
           Sharon can shed further light once they provide more hints. Again, he should be a
           friendly, but he is all about the numbers and firing questions and shouting. You'll see
           we have a section in the attached that provides a number of specifics for you re: Alaska's
           oil and gas reserves, etc.
                                                                  2




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01_0019681

            Also, here is a link to a Kudlow article that you may find helpful reading as well:

            Neil Cavuto I have not been able to watch because I do not get FOX News .  Sharon will
           also hopefully have more information on him for you, if you do not already have it.



            There are two highlighted portions : price of gas in the bush - we'll have the latest
           numbers for you in a couple of days. And I am waiting for the exact dollars re: price per
           barrel upon which the state balances its budget .  The figures in the attached are rough.



            Please let us know if you need anything else.



            Thanks,

            Meghan
