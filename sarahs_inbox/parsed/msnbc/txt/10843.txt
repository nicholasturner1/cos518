                I want to clarify something in this email in case anyone mis -understood . In several conversations in the
                last couple of hours , I have said that due to the transition to Juneau for session , we would be unable to
                attend the meeting . I can't speak for Sen . Huggins Office as I don 't work for him, but I believe they are in
                a similar predicament.

                I know Rep. Neuman would appreciate any contact after the meeting. I am sure you will be able to
                provide us with your concerns. I am sorry if there was any confusion.

                Can you lay out your requirements for notification in this type of Public Meeting and give us a status on
                meeting that requirement.

               Hi Ron,
               Please tell me what authority you are using to waive the 30 day notice period as required per AS
               44.62.190? A PUBLIC WORK SHOP, ("TO HELP WRITE A WILLOW LAKE USE PLAN THAT WHEN
               IMPLEMENTED WILL ALLOW SAFE USE OF THE LAKE"), is a very IMPORTANT MEETING, AS IT
               IMPLIES THAT THE USES OF THE LAKE WILL CHANGE.

               We the public NEED NOTICE, so that we can plan our time to participate in these meetings. I think that is
               why we have AS 44.62.190, so that the BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC CAN BE SERVED.
               Again, I ask you what date did you post the notice of the meeting in the Daily News?
               I know you posted the notice on the State of Alaska's "On Line Public Notice" on January 3, 2008. That
               gives us 5 days notice which is not sufficent notice time.
               I still have not received the notice or the draft plan, that you mailed, what date were they mailed? No one
               I know has received your notice.

               After 40 years of DOTS NON-MANGEMENT of the lake why are you pushing this so fast. Our last
               meeting was on October 10,2007. You had plenty of time to plan the next meeting with a full 30-day legal

               notice period. Huggins and Neumans office just stated that they would be sending their representives to the
               meeting as they are both in Juneau.

               As a property owner, I can not help but feel that DOT is trying to push off their agenda on us without our full
               knowledge. or input, we know that "DOT OR AVIATION HOLDS THE TRUMP CARD", BECAUSE YOU HAVE
               TOLD US MANY TIMES.
               Willow Air Taxi is not operating on the lake until next summer. Historically,there are no recorded accidents with
               aircraft on the lake, WHAT IS THE RUSH?
               I agree we need meetings and solutions that meet THE BEST USE OF STATE LANDSIWATER.
               Thanks, Linda

                 Good day Ms. Holzman

                 Notice has been posted and published of the up-coming workshop. I've checked with Central Region and they
                 say the letters did go out to everyone so I hope you've received it. Notice of less than a month is typical for
                 public workshops. We were trying to set this meeting up so that Senator Huggins and Representative Neuman
                 could attend , as people requested -the session starts soon after.

                 Please let me know if you did not receive the draft plan.

                 Hi Ron,
                 I see that you posted notice of the workshop meeting for Willow Lake Use Plan on the States of Alaska "Online
                 Public Notice Page", today January 3, 2008, at 9:29 am. What is the normal posting time to notifly all interested
                 parties of a public meeting? Is five (5) days normal? Many of us are interested and need to make plans to
                 attend these meetings and would like to know how much time you will give us before holding a public meeting.
                 Thanks, Linda
