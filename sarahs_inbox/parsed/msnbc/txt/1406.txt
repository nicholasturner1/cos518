  Thanks, Kris.

  Maybe this will help a little as we all brainstorm.

  The memorial bridge event is in August. So we can quietly sign the actual bill and then do a ceremonial
  signing later. I talked briefly with Rhonda today and she thought it would work well.

  Janice and I proposed a Monday morning (June 2nd) event at Ft Richardson organized by DMVA to sign
  two bills: fishing license and guard/firefighters. To my knowledge we haven't heard back from the
  Governor if this will work or not. It is an event DMVA will put together so they'll need a little advance
  notice.

  As for the well baby bill, it is also due on June 4th. Right now, we don't have any events on the calendar
  that are a natural fit since Sen McGuire wasn't able to make the March of Dimes event. One option is
  contacting Trevor in McGuire's office to see if he has any new ideas between now and Monday but I
  doubt the sponsor would want to do the signing outside of Anchorage (her district area).

  I will gladly sit down with anyone interested in the Anchorage office tomorrow and look at timing and a
  calendar. My immediate concern is with the bills which are due Wed., June 4th and then another set
  Monday, June 9th. The House Bills (we've got all the Senate bills already) transmitted from this day
  forward will be available to sign after the initial AGIA review during the first week of session, such as the
  ATIA legislation. My assumption was that it will be difficult for legislators to travel during the first 10 days
  of special session to bill signing events but after the 10th we should be able to pull several together
  opportunities in a variety of places.

  With input from others, my goal for tomorrow is to build a more comprehensive bill signing plan that
  incorporates a combination of bills through the month of June.

  Enjoy Fairbanks. Kelly

  Kelly-



  I removed the Governor from this reply as we all try to brainstorm opportunities for her to do some bill sign
  outside of Anchorage. I've copied Todd.

  She has already mentioned the three biggies: memorial bridge, fishing/hunting for troops, and the well baby
  exams. There could be a possibility to do these over the weekend and/or on Monday. Nenana is a given location.
  Was there any further discussion with DMVA & ADF&G on the military one?




  Are there any in the upcoming bills that would be good to sign on the Peninsula? As I mentioned to you today, Ron
  Peck mentioned the tourism match bill (not yet transmitted) and doing an event - perhaps in Fairbanks w/the
  Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau or maybe Valdez.




  We'll have to strategize because I know that SS is critical but at the same time, this is her one good opportunity to
  travel the state. Maybe plotting this out on a calendar when the bills are due, whether a ceremony is
  recommended and suggested venue?




  Let me know what I can do to assist.




  Thanks,
  Kris

    Wanted to do bridge naming bill w Rhonda in Nenana. Others on this list have

    been discussed for venues that would allow me to travel and do some creative

    things like the well baby exams. I realluy need to get to Peninsula and Frbnks

    and elsewhere and some of these bills provide good reasons to do so. I'll

    let others strategize on these too as I type my speech for tomorrow.

   Subject: Proposed Bill Signing Appts - Wed June 4th




   Governor,




   After tomorrow, we will have 10 bills to sign by next Wednesday, June 4th.

   With AGIA being the main focus, I thought it might be a good idea to schedule

   one-hour on Wednesday morning and possibly a media event at noon in Juneau for

   bill signing.     I have already checked with Janice and your schedule is

   available as long as you are in Juneau.




   DATE:                             Wednesday, June 4th


   TIME:                               9am (1 hour)


   WHERE:                         Governor's Office, Juneau


   (in-house, no media)




   BILLS TO BE SIGNED W/ SPONSORS:

                SB 57     Elton                 marine

   parks additions (Elton has requested a signing at the University but time is

   too tight)

                SB 119 Olson                  School


   library grants

                SB 158 Kookesh             Shirley Demientieff

   memorial bridge

                SB 164 McGuire              Used motor vehicle


   sales

                SB 170 McGuire              Insurance coverage


   for well-baby exams


                                                                           ROSTON 02536

               SB 211 Davis                Aggravating

   factor: homeless

               SB 214 Huggins             Hunting by

   military; Coast Guard (unless this is signed in a ceremony on Monday, the 2nd)

               HB 268 Stoltze              Burning motor

   vehicles on public lands




   BILLS TO BE SIGNED W/O SPONSORS:

               SB 8      Davis               Mental

   health patients right to pick gender of staff (HSS suggests no ceremony)

               SB 101 Ellis

   Guardianship & Conservators (already did a ceremonial signing for the bill)




   Another alternative would be to pull all/any bills to do with crime and hold

   one media-related, signing ceremony in Juneau - probably the Governor's

   Conference Room unless Commissioner Monegan has a better idea - relating to

   crime issues.   This ceremony could be sent out as a media advisory etc. If

   you'd like to do this, we'd need 30+ minutes on the same day, Tuesday, June

   4th to sign SB 211 (above), HB 268 (above), SB 265 (Criminal omnibus bill), and

   perhaps HB 88 (TVs/monitors in vehicles), HB 193 (Police Standards Council), HB

   286 (impersonating a public servant), and a few others I'll discuss with DPS.




   If you like this as well, we could do this around the lunch hour so legislators

   could attend and not miss AGIA hearings: Wednesday, June 4th at noon for 30+

   minutes.




   Please let me know how you would like to proceed.




   Thanks, Kelly
