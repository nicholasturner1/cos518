             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                               No. 08-150


    i                       Governor Palin Appoints Joel H . Bolger to Court of Appeals

             August 29, 2008, Dayton, Ohio - Governor Sarah Palin today appointed Kodiak Superior Court
             Judge Joel H. Bolger to fill the vacancy on the Alaska Court of Appeals created by the retirement of
             Justice David C. Stewart.

             Bolger, 53, has lived in Alaska for 28 years and practiced law for 30 years. He worked for Alaska
             Legal Services in Dillingham and Kodiak, as assistant public defender In Barrow, and as a private
             attorney in Kodiak from 1982-97, which included 14 years as municipal attorney for the Kodiak
             Island Borough. He then served as a Valdez District Court judge from 1997-2003, and has been a
             Kodiak Superior Court judge since 2003. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from the
             University of Iowa in 1976, and a law degree from its College of Law in 1978.

             "Judge Bolger clearly has the experience necessary to be an exceptional appeals court judge,"
             Governor Palin said: "His work as a trial attorney in rural Alaska, combined with his work as a
             judge at the district and superior court levels, has made him a seasoned, knowledgeable and
             thoughtful judge who will continue to provide exemplary service to Alaska in his new position."

               The Alaska Court of Appeals is a three - member judicial panel established in 1980 with jurisdiction
               to hear appeals in cases involving criminal prosecutions , juvenile delinquency, extradition, habeas
               corpus, post- conviction relief, probation and parole , ball, and the lenience or excessiveness of
               sentences.

               In accordance with the Alaska Constitution , Governor Palin filled the Appeals Court vacancy by
               selecting Bolger within 45 days receiving the list of the applicants nominated by the Judicial Council
               to fill the vacancy created by Stewart's retirement , which will be effective on September 23.

               Bolger will be subject to voter approval in the 2012 statewide general election , and in statewide
               elections every eight years thereafter.
