         MESSAGE:

         Ma'am,

           I am a First Sergeant in the United States Air Force stationed at Tinker AFB Oklahoma
         and my career is coming to an end after 22.5 years. i am a resident of Alaska though. i
         have been all around the world so home was really where you lay your head at night. When
         i was stationed at Eielson AFB from 1999 to 2002, i truly found home. If you we to visit
         my office, you would be able to see Alaska is in my heart. (Go Ice Dogs!) Currently, my
         wife is attending OU in their pharmacy program. When she graduates in 2011 it is our full
         intention to move to Alaska for the rest of our lives. I am retiring but i am asking for
         a special request. If at all possible, i would like a flag flown over the Alaska State
         Capital versus the United States Capital or both but the priority is the state capital. I
         cant find any information to lead me to right points of contact. Can you help with a POC?
