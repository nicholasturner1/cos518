           Subject: Deal with IBU



          We reached a deal with IBU. Unlikely as it sounds. We compared what it would have cost
          us with a 3 , 3,3 over the last two years and offered:



            $2137 signing bonus for each employee for the first year        ( 0% in lieu of $2137 cash)

            followed by 5% effective July 1, 2009

            followed by 4% effective July 1, 2010.



           We considered with this union the savings of them NOT having a contract for going on two
          years and our conversations with Washington state which ended up going to arbitration with
          its maritime unions , where they were treated pretty well.



            The amount of.money involved was minor to get to this agreement , considering our options.

            More specifics later.
