           We'll just need a head count and a confirmed time... and an understanding if they're
           separate events or at the same time (I'm assuming press would be sep, perhaps before
           leggies... they're dying to know what we think and how we'll maneuver thru these days
           before trhe votes)

            We'll no doubt just need the pie and coffee sitting there, we can take

            it feom there without burdening staff for extra efforts beyond that...

            it'll be that informal. Thanks -----Original Message-----

           Erica- Very informal, nothing too time consuming on staff's part. Todd

           and I can serve/clean up. Kel can coordinate leggies/sharon can notify

           reporters if we're doing something separate with them. I'm getting out

           of the loop at this point, pls just let me know the progress when the

           coordination is complete. Thanks

            Hello,

            Who should I coordinate this with to find out details such as time,

            guest count, and how we'd like to extend the invitation(s)?

            Thanks,

           I think it is a great idea .        Reporters loved it when they got the AGIA

          pre-briefing at the mansion in January 07.

            How about press coming over to the house for pie and coffee? More of

            them will be in Juneau for the assumed timing of the House vote. We have

           made ourselves available in such a setting for a long time - we need to!

              Either with or without leggies, I want to speak with press in a forum

            they can appreciate (as they've confirmed with us in the past- they like

            the gov's house events they've been a part of). Please let me know asap.

            Thanks
