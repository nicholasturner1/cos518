           Governor Palin Responds to Record Oil Prices




           May 7, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin released the following statement as
           the price of Alaska North Slope crude oil reached a record level of $123.53 a barrel.




           "Alaskans are feeling the pinch of high energy costs. The state treasury is swelling
           while the family checkbook is evaporating.  As prices continue to rise, we cannot wait for
           medium- and long-term solutions to come into place."




                                                                 1




                                                                                                           PRA GSPO1_0017194

          Each month the price of Alaska crude oil remains over $ 120 a barrel , the state treasury
          will take in approximately $ 650 million more than what was forecasted just last month.




          "Since coming into office, we have been taking a methodical approach to long-term
          solutions that will move Alaska ' s communities off of expensive diesel to cleaner and
          cheaper alternatives .  With today' s prices , we don ' t have the luxury of time. Alaska's
          families , communities and businesses are hurting and we need relief now."




          When Governor Palin appointed Steve Haagenson as energy coordinator , she directed him to
          lead a team to identify the most efficient and effective ways to reduce the energy cost
          burden on Alaskans . The Governor will unveil the plan to address the short - term energy
          crisis caused by spiking oil prices in the next week.
