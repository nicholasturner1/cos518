       I just talked to him recently and he passed along to me that (1) he is personally a
       supporter of moving the legislature (2) he apologized for his member's negative comments
       and that he could not put words in their mouths but he is trying to be helpful and (3) he
       wanted help in resolving the jet issue - a while back, he called you to let you know that
       we have a potential buyer for the jet but now he feels the buyer is getting the run around
       from our agent. I have asked Russ to get an update on the jet sale and will get back to
       Harris.
