               Dear Gov. Palin:

               Will you come to Texas for a luncheon fundraiser?

               We were in the Snow City Cafe this AM and over heard Jay Ramas talking about
               you and a vote to be taken this afternoon. We said hello and asked if you were in
               town and that we loved you -wanted you to come to TX. He said you were not
               smart and were dangerous. He said he would vote for McCain -but not you.
               What is his problem ? He seemed like he had an unfair agenda about you.

               We have surveyed people here1since our arrival and passing out McCain/Palin
               stickers (we had printed in TX) and they either really like you or love you.
               We love you too and will be working here on our trip and in Texas when
               we go home.
    i
               God Bless and Good Fortune and please lets win in Nov.

               Sincerely,

               Barbara Dewberry
