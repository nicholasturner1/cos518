          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor,




         I hope this wasn't sent to the wrong place, but I would like to congratulate you on the
         birth of your son! We have a special child too, and A bit of wisdom I was given when we
         found out she had a semi-rare syndrome was that God doesn't give special children to just
         anyone, He gives special children to special parents. Since then, she has amazed everyone
         that lowered their expectations of what she could achieve. I trust Trig will do the same!




         Best regards,




               Dan Shaw
