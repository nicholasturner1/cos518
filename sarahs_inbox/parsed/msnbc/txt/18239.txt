         A break from AGIA.... Mat maid, the visit, the truth

         Posted: June 16, 2007 - 3:01 pm



         Much has been written about Governor Palin's visit to

         the Matanuska Maid Dairy and how she was spurned from

         taking a tour.



         What you didn't hear about was the actual behind the

         scenes events which took place.



         June 13,2007



         10:00am - The Governor's office calls Mat-Maid and

         requests a tour of the plant. They are told by

         employees that the plant manager is gone and the only

         person authorized to give tours, the CEO, is at a well

         publicized board meeting. It is suggested they

         reschedule for later.



         11:00am - Kris Perry from the Governor's Office calls

         and announces that Governor Palin will be there at

        noon. Perry is told once again that there will be

        noone there authorized to give a tour. Mat-Maid is

        told it is will just be a few people.

                                                          2




                                                                                                    PRA GSP01_0002578

         11:30am - Unable to reach the CEO on his cell phone

         because he is in the middle of a presentation to the

         creamery board, the CEO's wife fields a frantic phone

         call from the office.



         11:45am - The CEO's wife in her car arrives at the

         Westmark Hotel where she slips a note to the CEO. The

         public session has just begun and the CEO is unable to

         leave until he is finished with Q &A. He instructs his

         office to make the governor as comfortable as possible

          in the conference room until he can break away.



         Noon - The Governor arrives with a large entourage of

         people, including her husband Todd, daughter Piper,

         DNR officials, staff and security. Also in tow is

          several media outlets.



         Todd Palin becomes agitated and asks the Mat-Maid

          employees " are you telling me you won ' t let the

         Governor of Alaska tour this facility?"



          12:30pm - The CEO finally breaks away from the meeting

          and calls his office to inform them he is 7 or 8

         minutes away from the plant.



          Back at Mat-Maid, the Governor decides to wait no

          longer and leaves before the CEO arives.



          Prediction - Next week a new creamery board will be

          appointed and the head will be Robert Gottstein who

         has also been recently awarded a grant for $475,000

          from the federal government to open a milk bottling

         plant in Palmer.

          Fact - Did you know that over the last 20 years,

          Matanuska Maid in an effort to support Alaskan Grown

          have paid Alaskan Dairy Farmers roughly $ 4 million

          dollars more for locally produced milk than they paid

          for milk imported from outside Alaska?



          Much more on this story to come.
