             Lt. Governor is fine too. Yes- Sat/Sun fine. I'm supposed to arrive Juneau Sat 2:30. If
             there's a delay I can always participate from anywhere via phone. Thanks



             Hope all is well - did PA have compelling and legally sound reasons to hear them out?

             Boss,



              We are coming up on another big decision on the PA request for reconsideration. The
             commissioners are leaning in one direction, but would like to talk to you this weekend.
             They are headed to DC Tuesday and Pat is traveling Monday, so they are requesting some of
             your time on Saturday or Sunday to have a teleconference. Is that something that can work
             for you? If so, is there anybody besides myself, Tibbles, and Marty that you want
             involved? Remember that we had the Lt Gov involved last time.



              Joe
