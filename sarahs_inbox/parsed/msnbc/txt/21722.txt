              Keep in mind- we're not responding to Halcro, Fagen, et al... we're responding to the
              specific false allegation from "a majority lawmaker" (as cited by our critics) that I'm
              "threatening and pressuring".  We owe it to Alaskans who argree that the threats are more
              politics-as-usual to clear it up, and I will respond to those things which I know will
              hurt our efforts if we don't take the time to clear it up. Thanks

              Don't know how these rumors of me "pressuring" lawmakers- espescially Rural leggies-
              started, and don't know why they're continuing, but I've met with them many times and
              communicated with lawmakers on the phone at your request and upon your advice. Now, if
              it's doing more harm than good to talk to any lawmaker (and I've never threatened, bribed
              or anything else), please don't keep setting up these opportunities to work with them.



             I think it's fishy that Harris came to me with the rumors of my "threats" to lawmakers if
             they don't go along with ACES, which is bull.., and then it' s his suspicious aide we
             believe is blogging the same bogus information.



             Please do what you can do about the situation because perhaps we're better off not giving
             our critics more opportunity to lie about the situation, meaning no more meetings between
             me and lawmakers. ?
