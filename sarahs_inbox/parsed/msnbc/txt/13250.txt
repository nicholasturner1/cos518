             Hickle Award for Distinguished Public = Policy Leadership.



             They and I would very much like you to = come. The award presentation is tentatively
             scheduled for August 20 = in Anchorage. The program people are currently deciding whether
             the = event will be at lunch time or in the evening.



             I know that you can't commit to something that = far in the future, but I'm hopeful that
             you and Janice will mark the date = in the event that your schedule will permit.



            Needless to say, I'm surprised, appreciative, = and humbled - all at the same time,
            especially when I think of all the = deserving people I've worked with in the past and
            now.




            Please note that my email address has = changed. My new email address = is
            <mailto:jwkatz@alaskadc.org> jwkatz@alaskadc.org. = Thank you .
