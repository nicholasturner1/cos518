  Janice and Todd,
  I spoke with the coordinators of the reception, and they verified that the event on the 10th is scheduled to
  start at 6pm rather than 6:30. They will probably give everyone a few minutes to arrive, then begin the
  program at about 6:15. Eric Olson will speak first, then they would like Todd to say a few words. I will
  work with Beth and Sharon on talking points.
  Thanks,
  Cora

  Todd/Cora -

 I just received a call from Paula Cullenberg with the AK Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program. Paula indicated that
 they would like Todd at the Opening Reception, Monday, December 10, 2007 @ 6:30 p.m. to give speech and
 then Cora on Tuesday, December 11, 2007 @ 6:30 p.m. to give speech. Apparently they are or have sent Cora
 talking points for Todd. Please let me know if I need to do anything else for you. Thanks, Janice
