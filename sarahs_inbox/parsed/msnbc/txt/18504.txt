          Governor -



          Commissioner Monegan called me directly and asked to meet with you

          tomorrow.    This is the first time the Commissioner has called directly

          for scheduling.      I have not spoken with his office to this regards

         previously.      He will be bringing Deputy Commissioner John Glass. Mike

         T. and Randy Ruaro will be calling in from Juneau to join the meeting.

         The Commissioner knows that it is just for 30 minutes. It is in regards

         to DPS Issues - Crime Lab, Second Aircraft, Public Safety State

         Employees.     Thanks, Janice
