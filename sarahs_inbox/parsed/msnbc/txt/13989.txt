            Additionally, where the heck was Harold on all of this??? He helped with this plot to one
            up the governor and he' s supposed to be on our side!!! Somebody needs to put the fear of
            God in that guy. I'd be happy to do it if someone more appropriate doesn 't send him a
            clear msg.

            this it'll look like Lyda and Charlie have forced us into this which is absolutely not the
            case.



            This administration did not NEED the poll that Huggins referenced to have the wisdom to
            look at these prospects. They knew it was the right thing to do and it is being looked at
            in conjunction with the highway route.



            Governor I don't want to task you with anything.... there's an AGIA communications meeting
            going on right now. Do you want me to interject these comments on their meeting in light
            of the senate press conference?

             Wanted to give you guys a heads up from Don. He was in the ANGDA office and saw a
             resolution that the House and Senate are going to support. The resolution calls for
             amending the special session agenda to include in-state gasline proposals to be
             considered.  Don asked for a copy of the resolution, but they wouldn't give him one.



            Not sure if and when this is going to happen, but wanted to pass along. I just looked at
            the House and Senate floor calendar and I don't see it on there, nevertheless it could
            come up.
