           Today is overly-packed. I will have no time to prepare for tomorrow's speech at all- has
           anyone drafted anything? Its a shame they threw out a last-minute invitation. I'll do it
           if someone can come up with a solid, intelligent, visionary talk to go from. Pls have
           Barbara consider.

           Governor - You have a request from the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals
           to give a Welcome. This is the 41st Annual Fall Principals Conference. The Conference
           started on Sunday and goes through Tuesday, 10.16.07. I explained to the Executive
           Director that you were not available to do a Q and A on the panel. They are requesting
           just a brief welcome to the group. They have given us two times to work with. Either 0
           10:00 a.m. right before General Session begins or ® 12:30 p.m. - they will break for lunch
           at that time. Expected attendance is 300-400.



           Location:     ANC - Sheraton Hotel



           Also, Speaker Harris would like an appointment with you tomorrow. Thanks, Janice
