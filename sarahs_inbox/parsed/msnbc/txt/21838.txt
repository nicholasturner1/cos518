              I will add this into scheduling for the February dates. I think due to

             session beginning on 01.15.08 that we may not want to confirm this far

             in advance as you will not know if you're in Juneau or Wasilla just yet

             on those dates.     Janice

              HI-     I hope I'm not intruding on a personal email address- I got

              this from my wife Anne at Wasilla High.



              Each year the Rotary groups of Anchorage sponsor Pillars of America.

              The event is aimed at high school students and features motivational

              speakers who have overcome great hardship or have had unusual

              successes in their lives. It exposes the students to some of the

              great success stories our nation has to offer.



             Last year we had Chief Von Esson, Chief of the New York fire

             Department during 9-11 and Kyle Maynard- a quadreplegic who overcame

             his handicap to become a college wrestler and successful student.

             This year our speakers are Sean Swarner and Mary Quinn.         The events

             are an hour to an hour and a half and are on February 5th and 21st.



             I know Govenor Palin is a proponent of young people and was curious

             if she would have an interest in either emceeing or doing speaker

             introductions for one of those days.



             Thanks for your time and consideration. Dave
