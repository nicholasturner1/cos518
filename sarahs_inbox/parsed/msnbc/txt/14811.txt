           MESSAGE:

           I just wanted to comment on negative opinions received on your returning to work so soon
           with a special needs child. blah blah blah.



           I was back to work before my son, who also has Down syndrom, was three months old. He's
           now 11 years old, and I'm still working. It hasn't been difficult to juggle. Granted, I'm
           not a governor, but it's not been any different than raising my other two in that regard.



           Good luck - I hope you enjoy Trig as much as we've enjoyed Shawen . I don't blog a bunch,
           but occasionally I blog his "antics ". http:// shawenstories . blogspot.com.
