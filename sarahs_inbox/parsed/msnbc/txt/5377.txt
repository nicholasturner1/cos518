            That was a low blow she took. I can't believe it!



            The 5 o'clock coverage was great, I thought. Your quotes were great and McAllister ended

            Shoot - ktuu's coverage of the ethics issue made lyda look like she was on the high rd by
            basically claiming I was inaccesible and we just don't understand the process ...
