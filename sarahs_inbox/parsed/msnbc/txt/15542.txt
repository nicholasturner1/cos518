           Governor,



           Sounds like today was, well, a challenge. I and others let you down, and I apologize.
           Just got off the phone with Meg, we were trying to come up with a methodology to ensure
           you are not left unprepared again. An interesting (and maddening) dynamic, with too many
           cooks in the kitchen, but they're all in the backyard when you need one. We can fix that.



           If it is any consolation, it went great in Kenai -- rave support for our process and TC
           Alaska at a jam-packed Chamber and on KSRM. I think the others experienced similar
           results elsewhere at to big events.



           Two points:



           First, as to your Forbes interview on Thursday, Meg and I will ensure your have notes in
           hand tomorrow, as well as an assistant to be with you during the interview. Is there
           somebody specific you request? We can turn whoever you need loose from the Forum. I
           strongly recommend Marty.



           Second, re your Forum speech tomorrow, Meg said that Kris had passed along that you are
           not interested in "reading another book." I agree. You've been there done that re the
                                                                   1




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01 0018391

           minutiae of the findings. I would suggest something very simple, basically just an
           introduction, along these lines:

           Let me know if you would like Meg or my help. We stand ready to assist.
