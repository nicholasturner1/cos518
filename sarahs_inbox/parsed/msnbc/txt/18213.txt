             Subject: Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission
             Governor,

            I met with two strong supporters last night from the fisheries sector that expressed concern about
            Ben Stevens and Stephanie Madsen showing currently on the Pacific Marine Fisheries
            Commission. They said it appears they could be removed for cause, and recommended that Ben
            be removed immediately and Madsen be removed when her NPFMC term expires. Their
            concern with Madsen was that on a Commission that involves all western pacific states, she
            would be serving the interests of her employer, At Sea Processors, not the State of Alaska.
