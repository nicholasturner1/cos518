           Gov. Palin,




           You are "under investigation into whether you abused your power" so then you need to step
           down from your position same as you have required of everyone else.



           You "have violated the public trust", have your own "cloud over your head", so "for the
           good of the state " you" need to step down".




           I myself believe in innocent till proven guilty but that is not the standard that you
           imposed on others. No double standards in a supposingly open and honest government.




                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA_GSP01_0022108
