            I agree I should be there. Darn it, sorry this is blundered on my end - and as I'm stuck
            in the airport waiting for the milk run I chuckle at this glamorous governors life-stuff!
            Thanks, all. We'll do it tomorrow.

            I'm delayed again in Seattle - the coonecting fit's already gone. Won't

            get in til 8 tonight, via milk run. Checking on other options, perhaps

            flying to Anchorage instead of waiting here til 3pm to try to get a seat

            on that next Juneau flt.



            Pls announce Steve anyway today.   Have him say a few words after an intro

            by any DNR folks who may be available ? If no one's around then wait til

            tomorrow, tho I, hate for press to know I was out of town for a day and

            couldnt get back in time for scheduled Juneau committments.
