            Great! thanks

            Also, did you know Susan Daniels can't take the board position we gave her, due to conflict of
            interest? They researched it, found it couldn't work... did she notify you of that? Maybe you told
            me already and I forgot?

              Nice job, governor! You picked some great board members. I hope you made
              it back to town--the weather is ridiculous.

              Any day you want the tour/introduction/guest page gig for Track and Britta
              will be fine.

              I just wanted to let you know what GREAT additions Joanne Smith and
              Beth Farnstrom are to the Board of Nursing ! They joined us for the
              first time at our meeting last week in Juneau . Both of these women
              contributed valuable input and insight, even at their first meeting!
              I am truly looking forward to their contributions in the future.
              Thanks so much for the great choices in appointments.
