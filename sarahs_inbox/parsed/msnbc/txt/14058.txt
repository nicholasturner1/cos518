             Sherry can give you the copy of the request that she hand-carried over

             the day after the bill passed out of House HES.

             Russ- nopw Meyer's office is saying he's had no hearing request from the

             third floor on the bill. DOA and/or others can whip that out of we truly

             haven't done that- pls let me know asap where we are on it.
