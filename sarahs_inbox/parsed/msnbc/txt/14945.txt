          A quick brief of the Togiak's Tribal Court's Banishment order of their City Police Chief -



          Last week, I spoke to the clerk to the Tribal Council, Anna Ferguson, who wanted me and
          AST to be there when they banished Police Chief Aaron Parker. I advised I could not and
          that AST does not have any authority to carry out a banishment order from a tribal
          council.  She paused and reflected on that but Rhonda McBride believes that they still
          intend to carry out that order on 5/8.
