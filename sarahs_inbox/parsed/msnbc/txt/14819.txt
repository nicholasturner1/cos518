             Dear Governor Palin,

             Just read online of the recent birth of your son. Read that he had Downs. Want you to
             know that my family and I have known and are traveling the same road that your family will
             be traveling.  My husband passed on Christmas Day, 2007 but in all the time we were
             together(almost 54 years)we never regreted our daughter. She is I believe the glue that
             kept our family together. She is the oldest of 4. She will be 53 this July and it is
             hoped many more birthdays down the road. She is a loving and caring person, She attends
             a special school and has since she was 7 years old. They started in Louisiana where she
             was born, then Texas twice and on to Georgia. My prayers will be with you and your family
             as you travel the road that many have and are traveling.



             Sincerely

             Betty Ridgway
