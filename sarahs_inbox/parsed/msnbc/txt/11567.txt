                Governor.
                At the AIDEA/AEA board meeting today (1/25) the board took the following action.
                1, Elected John Kelsey, chairman of AIDEA/AEA
                2. Appointed Sara Fisher- Goad acting Executive Director for AIDEA/AEA
                3. Amended AIDEA by- laws to authorize AEA to employ an Executive Director and enter into a contract
                with AIDEA to reimburse paroll
                    costs for the AEA Executive Director
                4. Authorized Executive Director search for AEA and AIDEA through an outside search recruiter.
                5. Amended AEA by-laws and clarified the authority of the Executive Director.

                EXECUTIVE SESSION
                Had a briefing on Healy Clean Coal Project legal status from Charlie Cole. The board urged Mr. Cole
                increase his efforts to advance the arbitration process and report any progress back to the board.
                We are expecting a formal proposal for the Northwest Arctic Borough to acquire the Red Dog road and
                dock at the next meeting.
