         Governor/Todd:




         Just an FYI that we still have the       Certificate for the Taku Glacier Lodge Flight and Feast
         that will expire the end of August      - 08.31.08 .  This is a floatplane that departs from the
         downtown JNU waterfront . You will      tour over 5 glaciers and land at the Taku Glacier Lodge
         for an Alaskan King Salmon Feast.       This takes approx . 2 hours.




         Something you may want to do on Sunday , August 3 .        I have called and the departure times
         from JNU for Sunday are:




         9:00 a.m.



         11:00 a.m.



         1:00 P.M.



         3:00 p.m.




         The afternoon flights probably would be better for the dinner portion.
