              Governor.

              As of today:

              HOUSE

                1. HB 4002 - Resource Rebate bill moved as amended to add the $1,200 as a line item on the pfd
                    onto the House Finance Committee. It is scheduled for a hearing on Saturday. Karen, Jerry
                    Burnett, and I are carrying the bill. In the House Community and Regional Affairs Committee,
                    Salmon and Olson signed "do pass" recommendations. (which is usually a pretty strong show of
                   support for a bill). Fairclough, Dahlstrom, and LeDoux signed "no recommendation" which is
                    usually a sign they are on the fence. Neuman was our only strong opponent of the bill and signed
                   as a "do not pass" recommendation. All legislators are free to vote however they want on the
                   floor.
                2. HB 4003 - Energy Appropriations bill moved as amended to show the $50 million in savings
                   from the Olson amendment to the resource rebate bill which eliminated the supplemental
                   application process onto the House Finance Committee. It is scheduled for a hearing on
                   Saturday. As the resource rebate bill stands now, only persons found eligible for the 2008 pfd will
                   get the $1,200 resource rebate. The committee requested, and we agreed completed with the
                   committee to work on an amendment that would pick up the veterans who would otherwise be left
                   out of the resource rebate. This is a group of roughly 400 elderly and non-service disabled
                   veterans who do not apply for the PFD now because the fads offset the income against their VA
                   benefits. Salmon and LeDoux were the "do pass" votes with Neuman the only "do not pass"
                   again.
                3. HB 4004 - Motor Fuel Tax bill moved as amended out of the House Labor and Commerce
                   committee. Gatto and Neuman were the "do pass" votes on the bill, Gardner and Buch were the
                   "do not pass" votes, and Ramras and Olson were the "no recommendation" votes. The bill moved
                   on to the House Finance Committee. It is scheduled for a hearing on Monday. Not much public
                   support showing up for this bill I think the urban D's (Buclh, Gardner) oppose it because the
                   Alaska Conservation League? showed up and basically testified as I interpreted it that if you lower
                   the price of fuel, people will use more of it and we will move more slowly towards alternative fuels,
                   and that there is no guarantee the tax savings will be passed onto the consumers. Cora and I are
                   meeting with UFA and other fishing groups tomorrow to try and get them interested in the bill and
                   the savings it would provide to Alaska commercial and charter fishermen, many of whom live in
                   rural areas.

              SENATE

                1. SB 4002 - Resource Rebate bill was heard and held in Senate Finance. I will try to work
                   tomorrow with the committee aide for Stedman to review issues and answer any questions I can.

                    No schedule yet that I am aware for the committee taking up the bill again.
                 2. SB 4003 - Energy Appropriations bill was heard and held in Senate Finance.
                 3. SB 4004 - Motor Fuel Tax bill was heard and held in Senate Finance. From his questions, I think Bert
                    believes that most or a good part of the savings for fishermen from not paying the motor fuel tax would go
                    to non-resident fishermen buying fuel in Dutch Harbor. I am trying to put together some stats on Alaska
                    resident permit holders and resident charter fishermen to show significant savings go to Alaskans. I will
                    work on this tomorrow.

              Thanks,

              We will continue trying to move full speed ahead.

              Randy
                4.
