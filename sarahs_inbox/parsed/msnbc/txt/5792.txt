            FYI only.

            AP called today because of this picture. "They wanted to verify your position. I said that the
            Governor does not feel that it is appropriate to advise Alaskans on how to vote on the issue.
            We have already asked this group to remove the Governor's official photo and her title from
            their website."

            I then emailed the group - in follow-up to Sharon Leighow's.

            Thanks,
            Meg

            Again, on behalf of Governor Sarah Palin, I respectfully ask that you remove the Governor's
            official portrait and title from your website. As has already been conveyed, the Governor
            does not feel that it is appropriate to advise Alaskans on how to vote on the issue.

           Thank you for your immediate attention.

            Meghan
