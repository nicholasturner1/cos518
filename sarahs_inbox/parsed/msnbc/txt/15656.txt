               Okay, I've been doing some research. Apparently there was an invitation from USDA to attend their agrict
               breakfast meeting yesterday that the delegation attended. In addition there was an invite that Janice rec'd
               emailed us on a ribbon cutting for the creamery but that it was noted that it was not the "official" event, anc
               more formal, organized event would take place in the fall. I completely blew over that one, and I apologize.
               However, it doesn't sound like the Board knew about it at all. I believe that USDA was involved in orchestr
               this. Again, my apologies for the oversight.

                 Very,very odd. And disappointing. I hope they at least invited Kristan and Jc.

                 and others!       Wonder if Lyda had anything to do w this.

                Oh my goodness. No, we did not receive an invitation and I'm calling Kyle

                this morning. He and I spoke a few weeks.back and he said they weren't ready

                yet for a grand opening celebration but that he'd coordinate with me on your

                schedule once they were. I have not heard anything back from him since that

                conversation.        This is unbelievable.            Yesterday, I rec'd an email from

                Dick Lefebrve that Senator Stevens was stopping by the new creamery and that

                 was it, nothing more than that. I'll go thru old emails from him or

                 anyone else to make sure I didn' t miss anything, but am pretty darn certain

                 I did not. So, in other words, everyone that had NOTHING to do with this were

                 there and those that BUSTED THEIR BUTT weren ' t even invited.        I'm

                 calling Kyle.

                 Kris- if you read the article this morning you'll see something's fishy

                 about it be the creamery claims it's success is due to Lyda's support-

                 and everyone under the sun was there at the grand opening incl Stevens, Young,

                 local elected officials, etc. Are we sure we didn't get any invitation to

                 attend? -----Original Message ----- From: gov.palin@yahoo.com Date: Sat, 31 May

                 Subject: Creamery Weeks ago I had emailed franci and others offering our

                 support at the new creamery's grand opening - we'd cut the ribbon or

                whatever - I see in adn they already did it. Did Beus or anyone ever invite us

                 to kick this off for them?
