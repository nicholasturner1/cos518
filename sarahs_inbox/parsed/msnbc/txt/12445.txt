            I will call the producer .         I would suggest after the press conference so everything is
            fresh.

            NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams is interested in a one-on-one interview with you
            about Exxon Valdez.

            I suggested right after tomorrow' s Exxon Valdez news conference.



            It would be 10- 15 minutes.



            If you would like to do this, Sharon can give the producer a call and make the
            arrangements.
