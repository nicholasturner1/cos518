               Mike, I want to thank you for the opportunity to assist in locating a Commissioner for Public Safety.
               I have also struggled a lot about submitting my name, and I appreciate your interest. I know I could do
               the job and do it well. As I mentioned, Exxon is working up a proposal for me that I have tentatively
               agreed to.I like the Governor and I think that being able to work with you was one of the reasons the job
               looks so appealing. You are stable and professional. I sincerely hope the governor sees Joe Masters as
               we saw him during the interview. He will bring respect from the Trooper and should be able to get
               things under control.
               thanks again
               John

               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                     No. 08-146

                                              Governor Palin Signs Energy Package

               August 25, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin today signed legislation that will help
               Alaskans combat the high cost of energy. The Governor signed House Bill 4001 and Senate Bill
               4002 into law at the home of an Anchorage resident who took advantage of the Alaska Housing
               Finance Corporation's Weatherization and Home Energy Rebate Program.

               SB 4002 uses revenues generated from the state's natural resources to provide a one-time special
               payment of $1,200 to every Alaskan eligible for the 2008 Permanent Fund dividend. The bill also
               raises by 50 percent the maximum amount of loans that bulk fuel bridge and bulk fuel revolving
               loan funds can make to communities and cooperatives. It also suspends the state's motor fuel tax
               on gasoline, marine fuel, and aviation fuel for a year and strengthens the Power Cost Equalization
               Program. HB 4001 is the appropriation bill.

               "Alaskans who signed up for direct deposit will see these funds on September 12, along with their
               dividend," said Governor Palin. "In rural Alaska , particularly, many people are facing a choice
               between feeding their families and heating their homes , and they could use this payment from the
               state's energy- generated surplus to cover some of those bills."

               Carol Geczy's home has been weather-stripped, insulation was added to the attic and crawl space,
               drafts were sealed and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were Installed . Approximately
               $5,000 was spent on the home with an expected energy savings of 20 to 30 percent. The
               improvements were made in part by AHFC's Weatherization Program.

               "The Governor's resource rebate, along with AHFC 's Weatherization and Home Energy Rebate
               programs, are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the hands of Alaskans to help combat
               high energy costs," said Dan Fauske , AHFC's chief executive officer. "Investing money in making
               your home more energy efficient is.just about the best bang for your buck you can get."

               Governor Palin also signed a proclamation declaring September as "Energy Efficiency Month" in
               Alaska . The proclamation encourages Alaskans to lower their costs by conserving energy and by
               using existing energy more efficiently at work , home and on the road.

                "Conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesn 't necessarily mean you have to sacrifice
                your quality of life," said Governor Palin. "It's the little things, like making sure lights, computers
                and appliances are turned off - and slowing down on the road, which will save money spent on
                gasoline."
