          Governor-

          We did not send out a press release but I did have several reporters follow up on your
          comments.  I made it clear that you have not made any veto "threats" and that you are
          looking forward to talking with lawmakers about the capital projects.

          Did we follow up press avail today with a press release so reporters would grasp more of
          the gist? Seems it's being reported as "we're forcing... wer're calling them in to make
          them explain... She's threatening a second veto now- this time with education"....
