               It's ok that the group would be separated. We can't turn down their offer to have at least some of
               this paid for by them. Is the state going to cover other hotel nights during that week? Also, what
               am I missing in terms of major events at the convention if I leave then on the 5th? And when is
               the candidate actually nominated? On the 5th?

               Governor - They have confirmed your speech for Sept 4 - the time is still to be determined but they think
               around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. We would not want to take you out on the 4t'. 1 have checked with the gop
               folks regarding the hotel arrangements. As they will only cover Sept 3 and 4 this would mean moving
               hotels in the middle of the trip. They will not cover the Ramada at the Mall which we have 4 rooms
               booked and need them all. The gop hotel will only cover 2 rooms so the group would be separated. I am
               checking with RGA on the hotel being covered all nights ( Ramada). I should know shortly. Thanks,
               Janice

               What events would I be missing leaving the 4th? And is the gop-sponsored hotel equivilant to the
               one you had previously booked (the Ramada?) ?

               Governor - we need to confirm up and purchase flights for MN as flights are filling up fast with the thousands
               attending event Your first speech is Sept. 2 (evening). Your second speech will be either Sept 2 or Sept 3
               (they are leaning more towards Sept. 3). The flights listed would put you in MN the day before the first speech on
               Monday, Sept. 1. The return would be on Thursday , Sept 4 the day after your second speech . RNC is covering
               the airfare cost for you.

              Governor, the gasline team will be back together next week and prepare a draft plan for your review. It will be
              great to be working on this with AGIA having passed.

              We will also work on setting up the AO signing schedule that works for all the interested parties. Tom
