            Russ- I will    be talking to him today. Remember, I wanted (and tried) to talk to him last
            week and was    told no, it should not be me making the call(s) to get leggies like Kevin to
            do the right    thing. I should have tracked him down last week and done this, as look at
            where we are    today- no schedule, 11th hour, lost time, etc.



             Also though, proponents of repeal can't rely on me to MAKE any leggie do anything. They
            don't work that way, so proponents need to rally as hard as they can to accomplish this.



            Lawmakers are sitting on over 100 bills. They do not want us to succeed, it's a very
            strange chemistry.



            Again, I will be talking to Kevin. And others must talk to him also.



            Russ, Karleen, me, everyone else needs to push harder on this. I agree with those who
            raise their eyebrows and question why the 3rd floor hasnt been able to push harder on this
            one when we do push harder on the other few priorities I laid out. The quasi-push back is
            very frustrating.



            Anna's right that an evening hearing is fishy, but again the proponents can't blame that
            on lack of progress. They need to more publicly act on this.'

            they got enough pressure ( they ' ve done it before ), and those in support of a repeal should
            be motivated enough to pick up the phone after dinner and testify.

           Meyer said tonight that he was not opposed to hearing the bill.                    He said it might need to
           be an evening hearing to allow more time.



           However , he did repeat some of the concerns you've heard already .                   He's getting alot of
           pressure from the committee to avoid the battle.                Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

            Russ- what did Meyer say on this? I haven't tried calling him again based on you speaking
            to him- but I will attempt again if he still isn't budging. Others who also want the bill
            heard must start speaking up, asap, including publicly bringing it to light that Meyer is
            sitting on it.

            Were you able to ask Rep Meyer to get the bill scheduled ? Just want to confirm either
            way.  I am hearing from legislators that Meyer will not schedule the bill.
