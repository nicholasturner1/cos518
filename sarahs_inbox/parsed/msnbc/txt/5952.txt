         Joe's Blackberry is not working, so he has not yet weighed in on this. Kurt and Antony
         have both approved it.




         I hope I struck the proper tone: resolve in the face of desperate threats by the producers
         to kill AGIA's must-haves (and not only not apply, but not nominate gas to an AGIA
         licensee in the O/S), tempered by the assurance that we just doing what is reasonable and
         fair.  Both full and condensed versions are attached.
