            Shoot- wish I could think of something more clever to say than the same of soundbite we
            always give about those poll numbers... I'd like to give Bill something humorous that
            reflects my acknowledgement of the fickleness of poll numbers and my committment to not
            govern according to the numbers. Also, I'd say something about our need to try even harder
            for the 14% of respondents who are not thrilled with our work here. (In fact, you can
            send him that.)

            He just left me a message saying they already got a sound bite from you on this on Friday,
            so he doesn't need another one. But he said to say hi to you anyway.

            Governor -




            Bill McAllister would like a few minutes of your time regarding the latest Hayes poll. I
            think it would be a good opportunity to say the numbers reflect that we are listening to
            Alaskans/we are on the right course with AGIA, budget, etc.



            Thoughts?
