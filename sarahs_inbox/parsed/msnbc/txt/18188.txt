         Lynn-



         Here is the timeline for the board' s search . The first ads will be sent today. Once it
         has been finalized , I will see that a copy is forwarded to you as well . It will appear on
         our web site also . After the department has determined the applicants qualify, the
         governor will absolutely be given an opportunity to review the names to make sure that
         there isn't an applicant who would not fit well with her administration. We will keep the
         governor informed throughout the process.



         If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me.
