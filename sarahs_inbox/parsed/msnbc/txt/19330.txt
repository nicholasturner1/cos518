          Dear Governor Palin,



          Upon reading the paper today, I noticed the photo of you and Trig and Piper, riding in the
          4th of July Parade in Juneau. You were wearing a Mac Center baseball hat, and I was so
          proud and pleased to see that, as Harry McDonald was my husband. I support you as
          governor and am pleased with the job you are doing.



                                                   Sincerely,



                                                    Carole McDonald
