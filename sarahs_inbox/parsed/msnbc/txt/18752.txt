          I googled and found a Dittman poll for Murk in August 2006 referenced on Kyle's blog.




         Dittman poll (updated)

         Dave Dittman, the longtime Anchorage pollster who worked on Murkowski's campaign earlier
         in the race, finished a poll on the Republican primary last night.



         He says he surveyed people who are eligible to vote on the Republican ballot and voted in
         the party's primary in 2004. (Except for a fraction - 7 percent - who have registered
         since 2004 and say they'll vote Aug. 22).




                                                                1

          Dittman says he didn't conduct the poll for any particular candidate and that the sample
          size is about 500 people. His results are similar to the recent Rasmussen Reports numbers:



          Palin: 40 percent

          Binkley : 29 percent

          Murkowski :   17 percent



         Dittman writes : " Fourteen percent ( 14%) are still undecided with a week remaining before
         the election, however a demographic analysis of the undecided voters estimates that if the
         election were held today, Palin would receive 46%, Binkley 34% and Murkowski 20%.
