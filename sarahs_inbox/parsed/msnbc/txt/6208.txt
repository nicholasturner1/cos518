             Hello Governor,
             They are setting up an account at AK Cleaners (Anch.& Wasilla) under Governor's Office with you and Todd as signers. I'll
             let you know as soon as the paperwork goes through. The House pays for the cleaners, so just have someone from the
             Anch. office send the receipts to me. Please note if any items on the receipt are not yours, so they are not inadvertently paid.
             Thank you,
             Erika

             Hi E: do we have a contract with Alaska Cleaners - or who is it with? I'll be dropping off dry cleaning soon and don't want
             to wait to get back to juneau to do so. There's an Ak Cleaners in wasilla and Anchorage do that would be convenient.

             About the Conference

             On May 9, 2007, the White House released Homeland Security Presidential 20, HSPD -20, which mandated that
             government agencies appoint a senior- level official at the assistant secretary level as their continuity of
             operations (COOP) coordinators who would prepare plans, budgets and exercises to test agencies ' COOP plans
             each year. The mandate, which requires implementation in the next 90 days, is designed to ensure that
             government agencies are capable of initiating COOP plans with little or no notice to remain open and ready to
             deal with terrorist, manmade or natural threats and disasters.

             The Continuity of Government Operations and Telework Training Conference is about best practices , lesson-
             learned and current thinking in the development of agency mission continuity plans. As a baseline of
             preparedness for the full range of potential emergencies , all government agencies, including federal, state , local,
             and counties shall have in place a viable COOP capability which ensures the performance of their essential
             functions during any emergency or situation that may disrupt normal operations. County and local governments
             have to deal with events such as hurricanes , fires, or floods that would require them to relocate their operations
             for an extended period of time. The changing threat environment and recent emergencies , including localized
             acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies , and military or terrorist attack-related incidents, have
             shifted awareness to the need for COOP capabilities that enable agencies to continue their essential functions
             across a broad spectrum of emergencies.

             Telework is an essential element of federal agencies ' COOP Planning . In the aftermath of the events of
             September 11, 2001, it has become increasingly evident that Federal agencies need to consider a full range of
             possibilities related to how and where their work is accomplished . Continuity of operations relies more than ever
             on enabling government employees and contractors to work from any location . Both the White House and the
             House Reform Committee in their recent discussions of COOP , especially in the event of a pandemic, emphasized
             telework as a critical component in any COOP plan.

             COOP planning as an effort to assure that the capability exists to continue essential agency functions across a
             wide range of potential emergencies . The objectives of a COOP plan may include:

             - Ensuring the continuous performance of an agency's essential functions/operations during an emergency
             - Protecting essential or backup capabilities of facilities, equipment, records, and other assets
             - Reducing or mitigations disruptions to operations
             - Reducing loss of life, minimizing damage and losses
             - Achieving a timely and orderly recovery for an emergency and resumption of full services to customers
             - Teleworking
