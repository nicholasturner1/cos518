          My understanding is that this request came in the first part of June.

          Is this the first anyone's heard of the event?

            FYI:   Tomorrow, Wednesday, June 20, BP Exploration is hosting a reception at the
           Anchorage Museum of History and Art celebrating 30 years of the oil industry 's partnership
           with Alaska.    The invitation looks like it is from BP/Alyeska/ConocoPhillips/AOGA. This
           event will be attended by community leaders across the state, and they are hoping the
           Governor might be able to stop by. If so, they were hoping she might be able to say a few
           words .  Time :  6:30-8 :30pm.  We've neither regretted or committed the Governor to this
           event.



            Governor: This might come up during your phone calls tomorrow.
