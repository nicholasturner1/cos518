           Congratulations!  I read in our local paper your commitment to running the State of Alaska
           along with having a very full family life. Your leadeship is exemplary and you are a
           wonderful role model for women everywhere! By the way, I have a 21 year old niece with
           Down Syndrome who is attending a special program at the University of North Florida and is
           moving into her own apartment on Sunday. She is a very important part of our family. All
           the best, Audrey
