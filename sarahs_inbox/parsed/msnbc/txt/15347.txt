          Yes - the bills signings came directly from Kelly. The Marines event request is just for
          you to address them as they are being deployed for one year. They feel that hearing from
          the Governor will give them inspiration and also help the parents that will attend. I
          will list as tent (in yellow) on your calendar the scheduling requests so we can see how
          they fit.  Thanks, Janice

          Has kelly seen the legislature-type events here requested? And hopefully people will
          understand all tiem contraints this week as I go through the 900 AGIA pages in addition to
          budget work.

          I'd like to do the military things- don't know when yet tho. What's the content of the
                                                                  1

         Marine's event ? (What will I be talking about to them?) Remember I do the firefighters
         conf before one of the new military requests that must have just come in...

         Judges interviews have to be short, concise timeframes between interviews.

         The days between now and when I leave for Juneau will be packed- esp this week will last
         week of public school events also- pls bear that in mind- Trig also has cadio appt(s) this
         week.

         K- pls print out what the sched looks like
