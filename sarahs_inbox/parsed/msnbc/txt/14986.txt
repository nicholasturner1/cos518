          MESSAGE:

          Governer Palin,

          I would just like to voice my support for the legislation supporting the funding of the
          Alaska Zoo. It is Alaska's only Zoo that I am aware of and I believe it is in a sad state
          and needs support. Please protect its funding.



          Thank You,

          Christopher Souser
