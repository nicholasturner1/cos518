             Right back at you, Karen! You have been so accessible to us and your team has been
             so helpfurthroughout the budget process. Despite very difficult choices at times, I
             always felt like I was informed and I could call on you or your staff without hesitation.

            Commissioners - thanks so much to you and your staff for the hard work on the budget review. This was
            a huge day for the governor and I expect we will be hearing about these vetoes for some time. Your
            support and leadership is so appreciated! I look forward to working with you in the very near future as we
            begin FY2008 and prepare for FY2009! Enjoy summer! Thanks again! Karen Rehfeld
