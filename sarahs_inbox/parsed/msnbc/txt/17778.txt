        Governor Palin:




        As you have solicited my advice in the past on matters affecting the bar and bench, I'm
                                                                  1

         hoping that you will consider the following information in your consideration of
         applicants for the Fairbanks Superior Court judgeship.




         As you know, I've seen the practice of law from both sides of the bench. As a former
         judge, government attorney, and private practice attorney, I have a good sense of the type
         of qualities Alaska needs in its judges. I share your perspective that this state
         requires judicial officers who will properly and fairly interpret our laws and
         constitution, free of ideological baggage.   I also share your conviction that individuals
         entrusted to official positions must be committed to the highest levels of integrity.




         You have before you what may appear, at first blush, a difficult decision for the
         Fairbanks bench.  The Alaska Bar Association poll has resulted in a number of candidates
         with fairly high scores. From my professional and personal perspective, however, there is
         one candidate that stands out amongst the rest: Michael MacDonald.




         As both a judge and attorney, I've had the pleasure of working with Mike. He is marked by
         a strong moral compass and a rock-solid dose of common sense , qualities often lacking in
         my profession.  Not only is he an individual of integrity, he is also committed to the
         betterment of his community.  For example, Mike recently received statewide recognition
         for providing free legal assistance to the elderly and disabled in Fairbanks.




         He is also active with the youth of our community in scouting, little league baseball,
         youth choir, and other activities. And it is fair to say that Mike is what makes
         Fairbanks hockey happen:   he is involved in numerous youth hockey programs (including a
         girls' high school hockey program), serves as Alaska Hockey' s Associate Coach in Chief for
         the Northern Region, is the Arctic Lion's Vice President for Player Development, serves as
         an advisory committee member for the Fairbanks Ice Dogs, and is a director for the
         Fairbanks Hockey Hall of Fame.




        In addition to this volunteerism, Mike' s experience also sets him apart from the other
        candidates for the Fairbanks Superior Court. In contrast to the other candidates, Mike
        has a recent, varied, and extensive criminal and civil practice. This diversity of
        experience is particularly critical in Fairbanks where our superior court judges are
        burdened by an ever-increasing number of cases .  By appointing Mike to the bench, you will
        provide Fairbanks with a judicial officer who can "hit the ground running" and help clear
        the back log of cases that are clogging the system.

                                                       2




                                                                                                 PRA_GSP01_0001584

         Finally, I should also mention what may already be obvious from what you've read: Mike is
         a very bright guy. Despite the fact that he graduated from Harvard, Mike consistently
         demonstrates clear thinking even in complex litigation.




         In short, Fairbanks desperately needs a smart ,. hard working,       common sense person like Mike
         on the bench.




         If you have any questions about this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.




         Sincerely,




         Joe

        Ivy,




        I have some information that the Governor may find useful in her work with the bar
        association and judicial selection. I know that she'll be in Fairbanks tomorrow but I am,
        unfortunately, stuck in Anchorage for the next three days. I'll hold off on calling her
        until I get approval from you.




        Thanks,




        Joe
