         Governor Releases Draft ACES Bill




         October 2 , 2007 , Anchorage , Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin yesterday released to members of
         the Legislature the draft bill that would replace the current Petroleum Profits Tax with a
         new production tax - Alaska ' s Clear and Equitable share , or ACES. This release , 17 days
         before the beginning of the legislative special session , will allow additional time for
         the public and members of the Legislature to review the bill prior to the start of the
         special session . The final bill will be introduced in the state House and Senate on
         October 18 , the first day of the special session .   During the next two weeks, the
         Administration plans to hold town hall meetings to explain the plan and work with the
         Legislature on committee hearings.

                                                                 1

          The draft bill codifies the principles set out in the Governor's September 4, 2007, ACES
          announcement . As promised , the draft bill provides a more transparent tax system and
          increases public confidence by improving the state's audit function, providing for
          forward-looking cost data from producers and economic information sharing between the
          state departments of Revenue and Natural Resources and the public. The bill aims to
          clearly establish the value of oil produced in Alaska and how the state and producers of
          that oil will share that value .  There are a variety of improvements to the State's
          authorities to protect Alaskans ' interests . Among other changes , the ACES plan removes
          the deduction for producers who fail to maintain pipelines and other infrastructure.




          The draft bill is available at http://www.gov.state.ak.us/aces/ or you may call the
          Department of Revenue to have a paper copy mailed to you at (907) 465-2301.
