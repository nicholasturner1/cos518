                         Faster, Better, Safer Transportation for the 21st Century
                         By Tom Donohue, President and CEO

                                      The failure of the U.S. transportation network to meet the needs of a
                                      growing population and economy is already having an impact on everything
                                      from safety to the environment, from quality of life to economic growth. We
                                      must immediately reform the approach we take for funding, planning, and
                                      building infrastructure so that we can keep people and goods moving
                                      across the country and around the world.

                         Evidence of failure is overwhelming.
                                                                                             >> Join the conversation.

                                   Labor, Business Unite to Rebuild America 's Transportation System
                                   Business, labor, and transportation leaders came together in Washington, D.C.,
                                   on June 23 to launch the FasterBetterSafer campaign, a grassroots effort aimed
                                   at putting pressure on leaders across the nation to increase transportation
                                   infrastructure funding.
                                   Chamber Wins Supreme Court Victory in Employers' Rights Case
                                   The U.S. Supreme Court on June 19 ruled in Chamber of Commerce of the
                                   United States et al. v. Brown et at., that states may no longer restrict employers'
                                   rights to communicate with their employees about unionization.

                                   All of the new health care proposals being floated around Washington during this
                                   election cycle must include measures to increase transparency, the use of
                                   information technologies, and a focus on preventive care, U.S. Chamber
