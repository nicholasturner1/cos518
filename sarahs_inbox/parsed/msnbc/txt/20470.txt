              Very, very concerning the "untruths" coming from them. I am dumbfounded at this, as I have
              never worked in an organization where these unethical practices seem to go ignored and
              unanswered. The lack of accountability is appalling in all of this. It is so concerning, the damage
              that is being done and the public trust that is eroding, that we need to gather as much information
              as possible, including FOIA-ing emails, tapes, communications in all forms, regarding the
              untruthful information being spread to the public.

              The news has recently reported on budget and personnel issues for DPS. I believe the reporting
              has not been accurate. Please consider the following:

              Operating Budget Reductions for DPS of $2.3 million dollars. (OMB)

               Subject-. Untruths

               It is appalling to see and hear the untruths being spewed about the DPS budget and contract results... especially in
               light of how hard you all worked to increase funds and provide tools that DPS claimed they needed to do their job.
               Your recent op-ed was great but seems to have been overlooked by some.
                 There are continual untrue claims about what we "did to the union", and this is unfair to you, to the whole
               administration, and most importantly to all Alaskans who desire and deserve truth. Please share your ideas on how
               we can get the truth out there so attacks on your work product and our committment to public safety can be
               countered with the truth. Thank you

                             America, the Burdened
                             By Tom Donohue , President and CEO

                                                      Congress may be in the middle of a month-long recess, many Washingtonians
                                                      may have fled the sweltering weather for friendlier climes, and the town may
                                                     .have slowed to a crawl , but nothing can stop the inexorable march of the
                                                      nation's massive regulatory system.

                                            A recent report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute reminds Americans of
                            the tremendous toll taken by the regulatory state-some $1.6. trillion annually . Anyone running a
                            business needs no reminder. Tentacles of the regulatory beast reach into every aspect of
                            business operations of firms both large and small.

                                                                                                                                         >> Join the conversation.
