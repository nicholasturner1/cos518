         It's probably just a simple setting messed up - I wish I had time to work it from here.

        I know, crap. Wyatt has been working on it but hasn't been successful. Hopefully Barb will

          The email didn't have Craig' s message so I'm not sure who it is. Will follow-up.

          I am so sorry to hear about Howard. I knew him... and I'll be praying for Roberta. Let me
         know what I can do, and when services are. Thanks Craig,
