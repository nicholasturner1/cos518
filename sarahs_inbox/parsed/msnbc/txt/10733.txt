              MESSAGE:

              Dear Governor Palin,



              I just read an article in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle [Thur. 12/27/07, "Alaska Governor
              bucks the system" (AP)]. I was most encouraged by this and wish you all the best and
              thank you for restoring the hope that a "government of the people, by the people, (and)
              for the people" is still alive in at least one state of our Union.



              Sincerely,




              Garrett
