              Subject:                 Nikolski Fuel Crisis Update - January 15th, 2008


              Dear All:



             An ACE charter will attempt to take 10 drums of #1 heating oil to

             Nikolski tomorrow , Wednesday morning .           APIA , APICDA, and Delta Western

              are assisting this effort.



             Nikolski has less than 200 gallons in the tank, which may make it a day

              or two. Heating oil is a priority due to the cold clinic and housing,

             but without electricity, they won't have heat either.



             A larger emergency fuel delivery is being planned with Magone Marine. Up

             to 25,000 gallons could be delivered.



             A new update will follow upon new information. Thank you for your

             attention and interest and please let me know if you need any more

             information.
