  Hi Todd,

  You and Rhonda are booked from Anc. to Galena. The return flight Saturday, is a chartered service; Jim
  Smith will not bill us for that portion as it's also being used for the students. Jim said that they would
  provide lodging in the dorms and meals in the dining hall, as well as picking you both up at the airport and
  providing transportation during your stay. TA purpose: Attend Galena Interior Learning Academy
  graduation ceremony May 16 at 7:00pm. and tour the facility

  Please let me know if you have any questions, or if any of your information for this trip differs from mine.

  Thanks,

  Erika
