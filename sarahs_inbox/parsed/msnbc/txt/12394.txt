             Regarding a meeting with Chuck, he left a request on my office voice mail over the
             weekend.  He lives in Northern Virginia.  He hasn 't been in good health, but I'm sure that
             he would make it to a DC meeting if you want him to do so.



             If you are interested , we could contact him and try to set something up at the JW
             Mafti,ott.



            Regarding your question concerning new developments , I think Chuck ' s basic contention is
            that the State ' s regulators are unaware of several relevant circumstances , as reported by
            Chuck's network of workers. The attached letter to Congress seems to be a combination of
            situations where he alleges that the State has misunderstood the consequences of certain
            events or was unaware of them.



            Senator Stevens has asked me to meet with him this morning on earmarking policy and
            perhaps other issues . So, Larry and I will be out of the office for a while beginning at
            10:30.  If you want to meet with Chuck, Bre can help arrange a mutually convenient time.



            S am and I talked about events over the weekend.            Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

             Per Chuck Hamel's request, I have attached his latest correspondence to Congressmen
             Dingell and Rahall seeking to rebut Commissioner Irwin's earlier letter to the House
             Energy Committee.



             I would be glad to discuss whether we should respond, and, if so, how.



             P.S.

            Governor, in a voice mail message, Mr. Hamel expressed his desire to meet with you during
            your DC trip.
