            I agree we need to talk this out. I spoke with Marty and we can do it

            tomorrow at 10? I'd like to get Kelly,            Joe, Tom, Marty and me together

            to craft something to bring to the Governor as a recommendation.                    Can

            you guys make it at 10? My office?

           Pat et al...



            I do have more thoughts on this and would really appreciate the

           opportunity to talk

            it out before action on Thursday . Maybe we could find some time tomorrow

           to discuss

            it all.



            Thanks for thinking of alternatives.
