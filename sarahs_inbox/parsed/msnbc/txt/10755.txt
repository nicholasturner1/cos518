               Very warm and friendly gathering this morning. Pastor Brad talked about their school and
               how they bring in kids from the Bush, put them up with a church family, and then they go
               to the Birchwood Christian School. Sounds like they have about ten villages represented.
               We can talk about some of their challenges later, but here's another group with a heart
               for the villages. Good to see
