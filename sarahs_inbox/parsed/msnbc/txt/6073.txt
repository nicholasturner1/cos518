               MESSAGE:
               Elton questioned Palin's criteria in making cuts, eliminating projects
               in Juneau while approving similar projects in her hometown of Wasilla,

               "I'm upset," he said. "I don't understand it."

               Raising Elton's ire : Cutting $100,000 for improvement to Juneau's Paul
               Emerson Park, while funding a $630,00 kitchen for a Wasilla sports
               complex. Cutting $100,000 for a new ball field in the Mendenhall Valley,
               while spending $100,000 for bleachers in Palmer.

               Governor Palin,
               I copied the above text from the newspaper article about your budget
               cuts. You cut 100 K for a new ballfield here in Juneau but leave intact
               6 and a half times that amount for a kitchen at a Wasilla ballfield

                complex? You cut 100 K for a park project here in Juneau while leaving
                in the same amount for bleachers in Palmer? With all due respect, Ms.
                Palin, you are not Governor of Wasilla/Palmer. You are Governor of
                Alaska. This absolutely reeks of Mat-Su favoritism. Shame on you.

                Sincerely,
