            I just had a call from her office again asking if you were available. She is in the Texas
            airport and apparently has cell phone coverage.

            Contact:    Privileged or Perk
            She will be in the airport and available until approx. 4:15 p.m. today. Janice

             Governor - We just received a phone call from Darwin in Senator Green 's office.    Senator
             Green is in Texas and would like to talk to you about special session .   She is changing
             planes and has on hour available from 3:00 - 4:00 p. m. (AK Time ) to talk with you.
             Unfortunately her cell phone is not working in Texas and so we would need to have her call
             into a number to reach you if you are available during that time period .   Thanks, Janice
