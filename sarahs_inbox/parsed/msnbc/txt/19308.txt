           Thanks so much for the update Governor. I am very pleased to hear about the Sheffield
           discussion.  There certainly are a lot of misconceptions out there! I agree we need to
           involve the independents, as well as the Producers, with TC after the license is passed.



           FYI-We were told late yesterday that The AGs just got a courtesy call from ExxonMobil's
           attorneys. They are going to file their notice of appeal (of Tom's remand decision) on
           Monday, and file a request for a settlement conference and appointment of an "impartial
           settlement judge" on Tuesday.



           All that was expected , but there doesn't appear to me to be any reason for us to agree to
           an outside arbiter associated with settlement discussions.

          I think he'll say something along the lines: "I don't care who builds the gasline, just
          get it built".

          Marty and Tom were amazingly patient w Wally. It seemed that Malcolm learned a few things
          and perhaps will be able to explain more to Wally. He repeated that they'd have to "study
          further" some of the things we were telling him. He (and later Sheffield) both acted
          surprised and unbelieving when we said in-state IS priority - as big line is built of
          course we'll facilitate spur and/or bullet. They thought we were so locked in w big line
          there was no chance for LNG.

          Also, Sheffield had heard we're prohibited from talking to anyone but TC once they're
          licensed . He brought up Lesil's mediation idea and insisted we need to consider this, but
          not with an outside mediator (instead that would be me) ... I told him the day after TC is
          licensed we DO sit down with them, the producers... all the players. We won't mandate
          partnerships but can facilitate. And I told him Hal had already agreed to that, as had
          Mulva, and I'd assume at least BP would join in too , probably Exxon, and why not
          independents too? He was shocked that we'd already thought of that and were planning it -
          and we were certainly not prohibited from doing so. He used the term "travesty" when
          referring to this assumed gag order. Kris has Sheffield's talking points that he left with
          us, I'll ask her to get those to you, Tom , Marty, Meg.

          Thanks again!

          thank you, you did wonderfully. Marty said Hickel was pretty tough. any indication from
          senator stevens regarding what he might say next week when he addresses the legislature?
          sure would be nice to hear him say something positive about AGIA.

          Oh yeah, one other thing. Sen. Stevens will talk about energy speculators. I'm a former
          trader of energy commodities and, to put it diplomatically, I think there's room to argue
          whether or not they are the root of the problem. That said, it's safe. to say that the
          goings on among energy speculators bear examination (at times like this everything does
          bear examination, right?).



          Good luck!

          Governor,




          Good morning ! I wanted to,make sure that you received this information , as Katz sent to
          your GOV sponsored email address and not the yahoo address . Kurt and I were pulled into
          this conversation yesterday and began working an independent stream to get in formation to
          you. I hope that we are adding to your knowledge and not repeating information that you
          already have.




          The note below and the attached are in preparation for this morning and any potential
          questions you receive regarding Senator Stevens ' energy announcement this morning. The
          first attachment entitled " Senator Stevens Visit kkg " is a set of talking points /
          statement that you could make regarding the energy announcement today . The second
          attachment entitled " Stevens Conversation " reflects the notes / outline I made following
          several conversations yesterday with Stevens ' staffers , including his energy policy
          coordinator , his deputy chief of staff , and some of his communications folks. I don't know
          if you agree with everything the Senator is going to announce but the notes reflect what
          he will announce today.


                                                               5




                                                                                                             PRA_GSPOI_0020362

          The bottomline in all this is how incredibly excited his staffers were to be speaking with
          someone from your office other than Katz. Based upon their reaction, they see your offices
          in Alaska as different and more personally reflective of you than John Katz who is
          absolutely wonderful, but an expected and necessary relationship. I used to converse with
          them (communications side) and they said that no one's called them to discuss matters
          other than Katz on a daily basis, and they were excited that your office was reaching out
          again and engaging them. It should be a positive experience today and no need for any
          defensive talk or action.




          When I called the Senator's office, I mentioned that I was interested in the Senator's
          specific remarks today because you were most likely going to be contacted and wanted to be
          able to make positive comments about the Senator's efforts and see how we could work
          together. They were thrilled and immediately the calls came in with the specifics and even
          asking questions of you: do you have any ideas to encourage fuel efficiency /
          transportation cost effectiveness on the stateside? And do you know if nuclear power is
          prohibited in the state and is there anything we can do to work on that?




         At this point, we need direction from you as to what you'd like to do. If you wanted to
         stand with the Senator during the press conference, we can push for that and arrange that
         as they first mentioned that as an option yesterday and I merely said that I wasn't
         prepared to speak to your schedule and didn't even know if you were in town. Would you
         like to attend the press conference? Would you like to issue a press statement or a press
         release touting his plan (we'll have someone at the press conference to ensure that the
         Senator stays with his comments)? Or would you just like to wait for press calls and
         handle it that way?




         Once you know the direction, I'll work up something for you and assist Sharon in meeting
         your. goals for today.




         Thank you, Governor.



         Meghan

         Welcome back .     It will be good to work with you again.




         I'm not sure where to start .         It appears that an awful lot of people are now involved in
         these dynamics.




         Senator Stevens sent me an email two days ago asking me to consult with the Governor on a
                                                                 7

          few specific points. I have responded twice to him by email, and he replied last night.
          He has not been copying his staff on our email exchange . So, I haven 't either.




          I'll summarize my communications with him, the Governor, and the gas team as follows -



          *     The Senator wants to work with the Governor on a bi-partisan basis to develop an
          energy policy that addresses national and state concerns.

          *     He may want to speak to the Legislature, and the Governor doesn't seem to have a
          problem with this. This could be as early as July 10th.

          *     The Senator wants to point to Alaska as a good case history for how petroleum
          dollars can be used to address short and long-term needs. Right now, the cost of energy
          in urban and rural Alaska.

          *     The Governor asked me to emphasize the high priority we attached to in-state
          production and use of natural gas, and I have.

                The gas team asked me to mention that, next Monday, the Governor will announce a
          two-step, public/private partnership to provide affordable natural gas to the railbelt.

          *     The Governor and the gas team asked me to emphasize the value of AGIA and the hope
          that we can work with the Senator on this.

          *     This morning, I received a very warm email from the Senator. He'did not comment
          specifically on all of the points I raised. However, he clearly wants to work with the
          State and the Legislature on a friendly, bi-partisan basis.



          A couple of other points. Much of the Senator's outline is premised on opening ANWR and
          using the revenues therefrom.  Circumstances are changing slowly for the better. However,
          the Democratic leadership in Congress appears adamantly opposed to opening ANWR or more of
          the OCS.




          We have fought for federal OCS revenue sharing with states for years and have come close
          on prior occasions.  In the current budget climate, this appears to be a tough sell.




          I hope this helps. Please let me know if you need anything more.




         p.s. I have copied everyone who is working on these issues so that we are all aware of
                                                      8

          Secondly, in that capacity, Kurt Gibson (Member of Gasline Team / Division of Oil & Gas)
          and I have been working on potential talking points for the Governor if she's asked about
          the Senator's energy plans or if she's asked to participate in the press conference.
          Earlier today, I reached out to some of those on his staff that I know and they were
          incredibly receptive to assisting us and pleased that someone from Alaska actually called
          them to say hello and ask for information. One even suggested that the Governor might
          stand with the Senator which probably doesn't even work with her schedule, but I don't
          know. At this point, we're treating this press conference as something she may have to
          respond to and we'd like to do so in a positive manner.




          Kris Perry said that you've also got information that no one else has regarding the bullet
          line. And so as I put the talking points together and outline my conversation with his
          office, I was wondering if you could check against your information and add to it.
          Ideally,. you and I would have this done by 10am ish, if that works with your schedule, so
          that the Governor can look at this first thing in the morning.




          Thanks so much,
