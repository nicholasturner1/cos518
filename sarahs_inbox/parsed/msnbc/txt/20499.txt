         MESSAGE:

         Congratulations, Governor Palin, on the birth of your son. I have a 15 year old daughter,
         Montana, who also has Downs Syndrome . What a blessing she has been and you must be a
         special kind of person to be so blessed. Good luck and keep up the good work! Thank you
         for having the courage to keep your " special" son even after knowing his disability before
         his birth.  These days it seems convenient to abort a baby that society sees as imperfect
         but what a gift you would have missed. Also, I think you would make a great vice
         president.
