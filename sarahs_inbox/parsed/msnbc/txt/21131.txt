          over hunting the popular Katmai bears to flare up anew .rnrnThe 4-minute-plus video, made
          by professional videographer Daniel Zatz of Homer, shows a female being hit with an arrow
          from a crossbow fired by a man who was able to wal

          k to within about 40 feet of the bear.rnrnThe incident, Zatz said, occurred Monday, the
          first day of a three-week open hunt in the preserve portion of Katmai National Park and
          Preserve, south of Iliamna Lake.rnrnThe video shows two hunters and their guide, according
          to Zatz, as they move in close to a blondish brown bear at Narrow Cove, an arm of Kukaklek
          Lake.rnrnThe bear has been fishing in the water and is walking through brush above the
          cove. One of the men lifts a crossbow to his shoulder, pauses and shoots. The bear jerks
          sharply, twists and jumps away.rnrnAnother man -- the guide, according to Zatz -- fires a
          rifle to finish the animal.rnrnThe bear' s carcass is never seen , although later a
          different hunter is shown skinning a bear in a shallow stream. Several bears were taken on
          Monday, according to Zatz.rnrnThe edited video captures two from the party of three
          hunters in what appears to be a celebration, with one man perhaps holding a small video
          camera of his own and a second
                                                                  1

           man moving in close as if to give a high!

          -five hand slap.rnrnThe hunters, including the guide who fired the rifle, are not
          identified in the video. Their names and hometowns were unavailable Friday.rnrnThe owner
          of the guiding outfit that brought the hunters in says in a written statement that Zatz
          and a television camera crew interfered with a legal hunt and that the Katmai bears are no
          more used to people than bears at other salmon-rich streams.rnrnThe issue of brown bear
          hunting in the Katmai preserve, on the Alaska Peninsula, already was contentious. It pits
          the many people who enjoy watching the plentiful bears there during the summer against the
          relative few who hunt them every other fall and spring.rnrnThe video's depiction of
          hunters standing or walking close to several grizzlies, sometimes within 10 yards or so,
          while the bears exhibit no apparent concern is nearly certain to add fuel to that
          quarrel.rnrnIn an interview Friday, Zatz said he made the video to reopen just such a
          discussion. He and others say the Katma

          i bears have become so tolerant of the presence of people, including the many sport
          anglers who fish the area's waters and visitors who are flown in expressly to observe the
          animals in their habitat, that it's unfair or unsporting to hunt them.rnrn&quot;This is
          about bears who have learned to trust humans,&quot; Zatz said. &quot;It's a question of
          ethics. It's a question of fair chase. People can decide on their own when they see the
          video if this is fair chase.&quot;rnrn&quot;Fair chase&quot; is the question of whether a
          given hunt is ethical and sportsmanlike, or if the hunter exploits an unfair advantage
          over the prey, as defined by hunters' organizations.rnrnThe hunters who shot the Katmai
          grizzly achieved &quot;their proximity without much of a stalk. It looks more like a
          saunter through tundra,&quot; said Sean Farley, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's
          regional biologist for a large part of the state that includes the Alaska
          Peninsula.rnrn&quot;It's not fair chase.&quot;rn

          rnFarley saw the video Friday afternoon. !

          It surprised him, he said.rnrn&quot;I feel personally remiss as the regional biologist
          that I haven't thought it out that this is what's going on out there,&quot; Farley said.
          &quot;Not until I saw the video did I realize how bad it is. It's not appropriate.
          &quot;rnrnPhone calls seeking comment from Rod Arno, executive director of the Alaska
          Outdoor Council, an organization that supports hunters' rights and access to wildlife on
          public lands, were not returned Friday.rnrnAnother person shown in the video, according to
          Zatz, is the man who owns the guiding concession for the area, Jim Hamilton. The man who
          guided the hunters who shot the female grizzly works for Hamilton, said Zatz.rnrnAttempts
          to reach Hamilton by his cell phone, office phone and e-mail Friday were
          unsuccessful,rnrnHe issued a written statement to KTUU Channel 2 News this week in which
          he defended the hunters and criticized those who brought cameras to Narrow Cove, including
          a Channel 2 news crew.rnrnIn the statement,

          Hamilton says that Monday was a &quot;very sad day&quot; because the &quot;hunters were
         participating in a perfectly legal hunt (and) had their entire experience ruined by others
         who chose to use illegal methods to harass and interfere with their hunt.&quot;rnrnAlso in
         the statement to KTUU, Hamilton said those he mentioned might face &quot;criminal and
         civil charges.&quot;rnrnAlaska has a law against willful interference with a legal
         hunt.rnrnA formal complaint against Channel 2 News regarding Monday's hunt and its
         videotaping was filed this week with Alaska State Troopers, said troopers spokeswoman
         Megan Peters.rnrnBut the men's hunt was successful, and Channel 2 did not intend to
         interfere, so there was nothing to pursue, Peters said. She declined to name the
         complainant.rnrnHamilton's statement said those who believe the bears have gotten so used
         to people that they are as easy to shoot as &quot;fish in a barrel&quot; are mistaken. The
         Katmai hunt is fair as well as challenging,

         Hamilton says.rnrn&quot;There are no mech!

         anized vehicles used to locate or stalk animals, they are not fenced or held captive by
         any unnatural means ,&quot; Hamilton writes in the statement to the station. The hunting
         environment in the area resembles a common coastal brown bear habitat that presents
         &quot;many similar. scenarios of large numbers of bears concentrated on feeding in nearby
         salmon streams.&quot;
