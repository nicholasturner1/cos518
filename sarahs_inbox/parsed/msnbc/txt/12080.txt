            MESSAGE:

            Governor Palin,



            I would like to know if asked by the Republican Presidential nominee to run on his ticket
            would you accept? And, why or why not? As you are certainly aware, there is quite a push
            for you as VP, as it certainly should be.



            Dan Fish
