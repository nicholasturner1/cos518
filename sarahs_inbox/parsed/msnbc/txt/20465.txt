           Good morning,




                       In all my years of growing up in Alaska I never thought I would be writing the
           governor and her family of this great state. Thank you very much for your kind thoughts
           and prayers for Brian's family. He and my nephew were the best that a brother could have.
           Brain was always there when I needed him for financial advice

              Good morning,

                      In all my years of growing up in Alaska I never thought I would be writing the governor and her family of
              this great state. Thank you very much for your kind thoughts and prayers for Brian 's family . He and my nephew
              were the best that a brother could have . Brain was always there when I needed him for financial advice or family
              support. Brandon is a child you dream about , never and trouble and loved the outdoors and to fly like his dad.

                     It's been a tough year for the Andrews. Our father Rupe died of cancer just a year ago in March, a very
              good friend of mine, Mike Zagars was murdered in Wasilla on May 31st by his crazy neighbor. And now my
              brother and nephew missing in an airplane . We here these stories and never think they can happen to us, but
    I         they do happen. I hope you and your family don't have to go through such tragedies.

                        Thank you again, for what you've done in the effort to find Brian and Brandon.

             Sincerely,

             Clyde Andrews
