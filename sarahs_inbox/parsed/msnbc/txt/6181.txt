        Governor - I have sent all correspondence in a reading file to you each Friday to the
        Anchorage office.  I am sending the third package today. I have received all outstanding
        TA's and will be working on those to get those caught up to date immediately for you. I
        have looked through paperwork here in Juneau and have asked the mailroom concerning your
        passport.  No one has seen it come into the Juneau Office. I have also touched base with
        Erika.  Thanks, Janice
