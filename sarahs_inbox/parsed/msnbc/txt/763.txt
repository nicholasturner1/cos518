Todd,

Here's their response. Would you like to focus on this now or wait until the first of the year?

Erika-



I wanted to keep you updated on the PSA process. We are negotiating with a video production
company right now. We want this PSA to look very professional and appropriately use the grant
money that we have to do this.



Our script & design is set. Would you and Mr. Palin be available to discuss the setting & script before
the holidays?



Best,

Jillian

             Hello Jillian,



             Mr. Palin is interested in serving as a spokesperson. Please let me know how we

             Thank you so much.

              Ms. Fagerstrom,



              I am writing today to seek assistance from Todd Palin to aid us in our mission of safer
ATV riding for young Alaskans . Alaska Trails , in partnership with the Bureau of Land Management
and National Park Se rvice , is responsible for creating ATV safety training for young people in
Alaska . Our vision is to have Mr. Palin be a spokesman for responsible riding and wearing a helmet
in a brief public service announcement for TV and/or radio . Mr. Palin is seen as a champion and his
positive image could help us carry forth our mission and reach a wider audience.



             Thank you for your assistance . I look forward to your reply.



             Sincerely,



             Jillian L. Morrissey
