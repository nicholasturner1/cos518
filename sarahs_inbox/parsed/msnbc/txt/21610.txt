              Hello,



              Sorry the beds not ready to go!!



              Here 's an update:

             -AK Club will install a timer since the remote system used by the club doesn't work for
             home use -per Gail.

             -Rewiring bid for 220 outlet will be Mon. 11/5 to include Todd' s office as first choice.
             With the ceilings/walls opened up it makes it much easier.

             -The bed is up in the cedar closet , sorry I didn' t realize it took a 220 outlet. As soon
             as we get a spot, we'll put it together and clean it up.



             The plumbing contractors re-worked the schedule to get the 2nd floor finished ASAP, I'll
             send you and Todd the new schedule on Monday.



             I turned the heat up-please let me know if the temp. needs to go up any more. The 1st fl.
             thermostats are in the 1st fl. hall closet.




             We love the Great Harvest bread!! B had wanted to go to that bakery every time we went to
             ANC, but never had enough time. Thank you also for the bamboo dif., Ban.Republic lotion,
             cute basket and pinecones- I love them!!



             Email or call if you need anything from the grocery. store or anything else!!



             Thanks,

             Erika
