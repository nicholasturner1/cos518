           I'll draft something this morning and get it to the Governor and you. I've put together
           similar statements previously, emphasizing a balanced energy policy that includes the
           three elements you mentioned as well.

           Senator Cornyn's office contacted me regarding Governor Palin providing a short written
           statement on her energy policy to post on his website for the virtual Energy Independence
           Days next week. The purpose of the virtual event is to provide a forum to discuss the
           importance of US energy independence. I thought we could send a short statement regarding
           Governor Palin's stance on ANWR drilling, OCS, and her gas pipeline plan. All three
           policy positions of Governor Palin correlate with US energy independence by increasing
                                                                 1

         domestic production.  The email I received is below. Would you like to touch base on
         putting together a few paragraphs? Also, what do you know of Senator Cornyn?




         Thanks,




         Ivy

         The Senator will be hosting virtual "Energy Independence Days" next week in which we'll
         have a new splash page, buttons/widgets, video of him talking about drilling in the U.S.,
         ect. Newt Gingrich has written a guest post for us and we're going to have other electeds
         discussing the importance of American Energy Independence.



         It would be AMAZING to get a simple 2-3 paragraph guest post by the Governor , a podcast,
         or a video that we could use to . help us get the message out. She is obviously one of the
         most effective people in this regard and adding her name to our initiative, even in the
         form of a guest post would be awesome.



         If we need to write something up and have them sign off, or whatever it is, it would be
         awesome.



         We're also going to be doing a blogger conference call, if she was interested in being on
         that we could work our schedule around her.
