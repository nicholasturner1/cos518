            Governor-




            I know this is the last thing you want to think about this weekend. But the Wall Street
            Journal photo folks were wondering if they could snap a few pictures of you running on
            Tuesday afternoon or early evening in Juneau. Please let me know - they would like to fly
                                                               1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0021311
