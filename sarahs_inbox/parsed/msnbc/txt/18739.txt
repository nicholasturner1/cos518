          Beth is drafting the speech. She did receive some information from Seamount and pulled
          some background information from the IOGCC website. We spent some time Saturday going
          over the message and specific items to include in the speech. I will check in today to
          see how far along she is now. Our goal was to get you a draft early and we should be on
          track.



          Mike
