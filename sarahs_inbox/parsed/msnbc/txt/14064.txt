             Retired out of St. George island but concerned about the people living there. I like the
             way you doing the budget and capital projects because now we have an energy issue of fuel.
             Lets solve that problem first but with alternative energy also then it makes sense to due
             Capital projects.Continue the good work for rural Alaska. Thanks!
