             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,




             Congratulations on the birth of your precious son! May the Lord give you and your husband
             wisdom to rear him "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."



             i am the 12th child of 16 in my family and am so glad that my parents decided to have
             children. What a blessing to know that each one of my sibling were precious to my parents
             and that each one has special care from them.



             God bless you and your family as you serve Him in the great state of Alaska



             Jim Lilley
