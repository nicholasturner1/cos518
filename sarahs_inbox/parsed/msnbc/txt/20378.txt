               This is Randy Mattocks, in Wasilla. I just wanted to say that I
               am behind you all the way. I am primarily and independent but
               have always leaned toward the Democratic part of things, but I
               have been a supporter of yourself since I met you at the Alaska
               Club. I think the good ole boy network just can't stand to see the
               positive changes taking place so they are doing what they can to
               make trouble for you. You are a good person and I know you
               will prevail. My best to you and I hope someday I can introduce
               my wife to you, a few months back I was in Juneau and stopped
               in to see Mike Nisiqak. Known him for years and years and he is
               also a real good person. Best wishes Randal K. Mattocks
