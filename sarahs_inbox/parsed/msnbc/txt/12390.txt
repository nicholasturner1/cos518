           Chuck, per your request, I will distribute your letter to Congressman Dingell to the
           appropriate State people.  Thanks for letting us know.

           Dear Governor:

           I missed meeting with you during your visit last November.

           Hope you may squeeze me into your schedule this week.

           I regret the embarrassment that may emanate for your

           Administration by Commissioner Irwin's improperly

           researched letter to Chairmen Dingell and Rahall.



           Another Congressional release on BP gross negligence in Prudhoe

           operations soon will identify gross, 'inept', oversight by regulators

           ADNR, PSIO, AKOSH, and the Fire Marshall.

            If you don't halt Reconfiguration of Pump Station #3 promptly

            90 ' of Alaska's annual revenue may be in peril. You publicly

            stated that NO PUMP #3 CONSTRUCTION WOULD PROCEED

           ON YOUR STATE LAND until Pump #9 is operating properly and

            safely.     Pump #9 has serious 'identified' problems which ould cause

           disruption of the oil flow through the TAPS this winter.



           As I told you on the phone last year, I have a plan for your

           oversight (along with the BP shareholders ) to protect your

            interests    (beyond your regulators) without any expense for

           the State.
