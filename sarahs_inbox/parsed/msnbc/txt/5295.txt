            Governor Palin and Mr. Tibbles,




            I received a call from the Corporation and also from Commissioner Galvin

            regarding the upcoming meeting (next Wed and Thurs). Galvin, as

            Commissioner of Revenue, is required by statute to serve on the board.

            Another seat should be filled by a "head of a principal department of the

            governor's designation." In the past the Commissioner of DNR, Commerce or

            the AG has served as the designee. Galvin recommends Irwin, Colberg or

            Notti.




            I can let the Corporation know which commissioner will serve if either of

           you can respond back via email or phone with a name.




                                                                    1




                                                                                                              PRA GSP01_0000345
