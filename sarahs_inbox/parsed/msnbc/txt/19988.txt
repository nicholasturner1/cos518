            Its cool. I'll get to the store at some point here for that. Mainly, just don't want the
            kids to have too much sugar/white carb stuff.

             I'm headed to the store to p.u. A couple of things for the House. Do you need anything?
            I have formula (orange container\sensitive) and mocha stuff on my list.

               Thanks,
