               Governor - We just received a phone call from Darwin in Senator Green's office. Senator Green is in Texas and
               would like to talk to you about special session. She is changing planes and has on hour available from 3:00 -
               4:00 p.m. (AK Time) to talk with you. Unfortunately her cell phone is not working in Texas and so we would need
               to have her call into a number to reach you if you are available during that time period. Thanks, Janice
