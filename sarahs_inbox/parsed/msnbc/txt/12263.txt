            Fb- just read your message from Heimbuch - awesome and encouraging! I remember my first
            year as Mayor and I was getting clobbered by critics, and then a supporter reminded me:
            you can't expect "thank you's and accolades", that voters just expect and assume you're
            doing the job they elected you to do - they want to rest and live peaceable lives, so
            don't expect them to take it upon themselves to say thanks or to voice support. It was
            great advice, so true, and I was reminded of those words when reading Heimbuch's. Thanks!

            Walt- I read an AP article re: Aniak requesting troopers leave their village. May I see
            the letter, and DPS response ... and please share with Rhonda also as this could lead to
            other issues that I certainly can't ignore. Thanks
