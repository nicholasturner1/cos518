           MESSAGE:

           I heard today on Rush Limbaugh' s program that McCain was considering you for his VP.
           Please, please , if you guys can get together, do so . We have 3 congressional people (out
           of touch) running and we need someone like you to balance McCain out .  I have never not
           voted but the field this year, makes me very afraid for our country. I know McCain is a
           war hero, but he like the 2 Decocrats leaves me without much hope for the future of our
           country.  Thank for reading my ranble.   Gwen Burchfield
