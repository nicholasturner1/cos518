         MESSAGE:

         I would like to speak with someone regarding the rules that govern ASAA in regards to
         school athletics. There are some real inconsistencies in how these rules are followed and
         who is allowed to play and who is not. I understand that there needs to be some rules in
         place to keep students from jumping from school to school chasing a sports career, but
         there are major injustices in how the rules are written and being enforced.




         Thank you for your time.
