            Yikes- lots of things on here that I hadn't expected. Tuesday is not good, as again Trig
            is scheduled forlPrivileci     in Wasilla and no matter what time they do this he'll no
            doubt need his mama for recovery.



            The ft wainwright and other out-of-town events this week won't work because of budget.



            I've never heard of the Chamber session wrap up and Ellis needs it explained to him that
                                                                   1

            FYI - You are listed as invited to the Legislative Wrap-Up - Alaska State Chamber of
            Commerce (ANC) at 12:15 p.m. to sign HB 125 and SB 120. This was apparently arranged
            through the previous COS towards the end of session in April. As scheduler I was not
            notified of event and we were not even sent an invitation requesting your attendance. HB
            125 is a long range budget plan that would take time to look at. SB 120 is sponsored by
            Ellis which he was upset to see this as he is not available that day and thought we were
            going around him to do the signing. These bills have not been transmitted to us even at
            this point.  In talking with the Alaska State Chamber this last week I have let them know
            that we never received notice of this event and Mindy let them know that the bills had not
            even been transmitted to us.  Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
