          Thank you so much! Glad you got to get out into the beauty that is AK. We stopped in
          Colorado - I was awestruck by the beauty there, but then realized I saw such glory there
          because the rolling mountains reminded me of home.

             I trust all is well... are we going to move forward with Rossi, or another KT
          replacement?

          Governor:  I just returned from leave (sailing with Laurie in SE; navigating ice bergs in
          fog; watching breaching and bubblenetting humpback whales; catching fish and crab for
          dinner, etc).  Anyway, been out of touch until today. Have quickly caught up on events.



            Congratulations and good fortune.



            Best, DL.
