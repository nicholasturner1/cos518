MESSAGE:

I read the article of the birth of your 5th son and I wanted to wish you and your family all the success
and blessings that arrive with parenthood. Of course you are a veteran, having already reared-up 4-
children before, but having a premature child, past the age of 35 creates challenges. Good luck!



With sincere love

Josette
