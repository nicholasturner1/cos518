            I'm back from the NEA speech - headed to mat-su college open house .              I'll start reading the
            chain of emails re: eni and CP.



            The gasline team should have announced our positive reaction to eni's announcement
            yesterday- we should do that today anyway.



            Ktuu stopped me at speech to ask about CP's letter. Told em a bit of what I read into it-
            but the reporter didn't really know what to ask.



            I'll read team's suggested response to release today.
