            Governor Palin and Mike,

           I've attached a memo for the Alaska Workforce Investment Board (AWIB). Click and Tara have collectively made
           recommendations for five seats . They would like to begin changing out the members of this board . They've
           scheduled an AWIB meeting for May 8 and 9 in Juneau . Tara and I have met with Tibbles regarding these
           changes . I don't see a problem with recommendations the department brought forward . If you agree with the
           changes, I will let them know and begin contacting the new members.

           The first page is background information and the second page is a grid of the changes.

           Thanks so much,

           Ivy Frye
