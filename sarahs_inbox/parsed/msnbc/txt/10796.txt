            Governor - We just received word that the folks coming out of Washington, DC for the Polar
            Bear Briefing will not be able to make it into ANC until Sunday evening.   This meeting was
            scheduled for (tomorrow) Thursday, Jan. 3, 2008.   The new date/time for the Polar Bear
            Briefing is Monday, January 7 at 11:00 a.m.  This has been updated on your calendar.
            Thanks, Janice
