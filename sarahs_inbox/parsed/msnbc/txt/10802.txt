                Dear Governor Palin,
                     Thank-you for having Colleen invite me to the Alaska Statehood event at the museum. It is moments like that
                that make me want to pinch myself, it is such a kick to meet those folks. Katie Hurley always gives me the
                biggest hugs. I met Jack Roderick and had a great talk with him about a book he had written that I had read -
                neat! It was also nice to see my old friends at the Humanities Forum and from the State Fair. By the way, I don't
                want to overplay this request but the Arts and Humanities people really would love it if you came to their Governor
                Award dinner next year, they really missed you in Fairbanks.

                     I think the LNG press event went very well.. The focus I had feared - linkage between future Enstar pricing
                and export pricing - did not materialize.

                     Thanks again.
