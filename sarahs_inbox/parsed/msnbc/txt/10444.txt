             Governor - I just spoke w/Malcom Roberts from Hickel's office this morning. We have you
             scheduled for Wed., 12.19.07 @ 10:00 a.m. at the Captain Cook Pantry. Hickel's office
             stated that he would like to meet with you in his office at the Captain Cook as he has
             three issues that he would like to speak with you in regards to. This includes Gasline,
             Budget Priorities that they can help you with, and Institute of the North update. Malcom
             will also be in the meeting and stated that he is having lunch w/Kris today and will
             update her more before the meeting. Thanks, Janice
