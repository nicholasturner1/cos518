                Okay Governor! We'll stick to the priorities! Budget, Gasline, Legislature.

               Kari & Tib - pls. remind those folks that I MUST loosen up,some hours in the day so I can concentrate
               on gasline issues... I am sure people will understand that these packed schedules everyday have to have
               some "give" in them in order for me to start responding to gasline inquiries. There are too few hours in
               the day - and night - to continue the packed schedule that has not included enough gasline discussions
               on my part. Surely people will understand that gasline must be my priority at this time because there's a
               great deal of concern in the legislature that we haven't buckled down on that issue. (Those concerned are
               basing everything on erroneous assumptions, but the problem these assumputions cause are growing and
               must be addressed.)



               Thanks!
