               Governor,

               I thought you might want to approve the Miss America script before shooting the congrats video, so you have it
               here as an attachment, as well as in the body of the email. Two things to be aware of first, with your family out of
               country, I haven't had any success in tracking down your Miss Wasilla photo; I've let Bonnie Faulk know it might
               not appear in the video . Second, just so you're aware of the presentation , the Wendy Williamson Auditorium will
               be dark, the velvet curtains will pull back, and they'll roll your tape. Essentially, you are the very beginning of the
               program. Bonnie is so excited that you've agreed to do a welcome video; she feels it really conveys to the girls
               that there is nothing they can't do. Please let me know if you'd like to see any changes in the script. Thanks so
               much!
