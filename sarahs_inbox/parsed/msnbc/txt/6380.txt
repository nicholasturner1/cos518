         I have put together a list of names that I felt should at least be considered. There are
         pros and cons for each and I don't really see any one option as a clear favorite and best
         choice.  Some thoughts are:

         Kris- in response to the negative letter to the editor in todays adn re: military picnic:
         i'll pen a response to that, so pls have whomever organized it or chose the theme to send
         a quick email on the purpose or thought that went into them choosing the theme. Cant
         believe someone could turn that one into a negative.



         Also- did u guys get the email i sent yest on my way to Alfred Creek? Sent it on the rd,
         hopefully it was recvd by all of you - any kind of "i got it" would be great and then i
         won't follow up with other recepients until this afternoon.



         Mike- any thoughts on leg liason? If, still, my idea on who it could be isnt going
         antwhere then we need to hustle on plan B.



         Remember i'll be gone to pick up willow in orgeon and spend time with family aug 10-20.
