               Dear Governor Palin & Ms. Rehfeld: My understanding is that your office contacted
               Principal
               Marman at Tumagain Elementary and asked that all email regarding our request that fun
               for a new, desperately needed computer lab for Turnagain, be also directed to Ms. RehfE
               Turnagain's students absolutely
               require additional computers in order to learn basic, essential skills that will be required
               for their education and personal and
               professional lives.
               Please contact me if you have any questions whatsoever. Thank you for your kind
               consideration of our children.
               Sincerely,
               Bonnie J. Paskvan

               Dear Governor Palin: As we have discussed on 2 occasions, Turnagain Elementary
               School only has 20 functioning computers (bought by our PTA in 2007) for use by its
               404 students. Please do. not veto the $71, 000 in the capital budget
               allocated for a new computer lab for Turnagain Elementary School in
               Anchorage . As you are a parent with children in public schools, I know you would
               want all our children to have access to learning opportunities with computer
               technologies. In junior high, our students will be required to take tests and do research
               using computers. We don't want our children left behind in learning critical skills.
                Please contact me if you have any questions.
               Kindest regards,
               Bonnie
