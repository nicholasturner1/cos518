         Re:      FedEx Tracking number:       790-291-793-861



                         was picked up at the U.S. Passport Office in Seattle, Monday, July 16, 3:11 pm




         I just got off the phone with Connie, the secretary to the Managing Director, at FedEx hub
         in Anchorage, 249.3173



         We.are diverting the FedEx delivery from Wasilla - Connie will hold the package at the
         main office and call me in the morning, when it arrives.




        Gary, let's coordinate in the morning with our schedules, either way, a new air bill will
        need to be brought out to the facility in order for it to make the 1:00 pm departure
        deadline.




        Fingers crossed...
