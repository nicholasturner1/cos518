               We're headed to Kulis around 8 pm. Will you make that send off?

               Thanks Sean. We went to zoo, then headed to wasilla to see willow and bristol- now found
               out the flt's two hours late tonight.



               I appreciate the offer! These are long travel days, as you know- and I can't remember
               when the last time I had an on-time flight. Thanks!

              thereafter at our place til plane time. (Literally a five minute drive to the airport).
              Just call me if you start to head our way. We'd love to see all of you in a relaxed
              setting (Rachel too) but no pressure whatsoever.
