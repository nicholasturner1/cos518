          Yes.  Marcia Davis is a constituent of Sen Davis (no relation, though) and will attend. I
          also plan to attend.

           PUBLIC INVITED TO DISCUSS OIL TAXES, SPECIAL SESSION

          Democrats to host community event Saturday




          ANCHORAGE - Oil revenue, good food and community involvement will all be on the menu
         Saturday when several Democratic legislators host a public discussion about oil taxes and
         the upcoming special session . The group of seven legislators invites the public to
         participate in the event at the East High multipurpose room from 1-3 p.m. Saturday.



          The legislators will bring people up to date on the governor's oil tax bill, Democratic
         priorities and goals for the special session and other significant news related to the
         October special session . The public is encouraged to share views, concerns and ask
         questions about oil taxes and the future of economic stability in Alaska.



          The legislators in attendance called for this year's special session in April, as the
         recent federal indictments implicating last year's oil tax legislation, were issued.
         Governor Palin soon after agreed. It is important for the public to understand the issues
        we'll need to discuss in order to craft a fair oil tax that achieves a fair share for
        Alaskans, and a fair investment atmosphere.



          There will be plenty of good food available, and the atmosphere will be conducive to
         positive, energetic discussion.



          WHAT: Community meeting on oil taxes and the October special session

          Where: East High multipurpose room

          When: 1-3 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 6
