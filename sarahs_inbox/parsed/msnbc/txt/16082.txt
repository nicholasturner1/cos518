           Subject:                 Mayor Begich Call


           Governor - I know you both have been playing phone tag on trying to return the call to
           Mayor Begich.  The Mayor just called for you now. I let his office know that you are not
           available until after 12:00 p.m. The Mayor would be available at 2:30 p.m. for a call.




           If we set the call for 2:30 p.m. the contact number to reach Mayor Begich - 343-7101.




           Thanks, Janice
