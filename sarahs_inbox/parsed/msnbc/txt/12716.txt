                  I certainly thank you for replying. I listen,read,and communicate w/a variety of" Citezens" of our great
                nation, a well spoken lady from Juneau highly praised the Governess on Rushls radio program last
                week, He was "Quite" impressed w/Mrs. Palin. So I thought I research,and must agree,not only
                impressive in workings with the bull.....I in the government, but hestated that she was a "Babe" ,, and I
                concur ! but I also believe she would turn a lot of Women...to take a good look at the ...other woman. I
                sent an email to J. McCain's camp last evening also .... Just doin' what I can to get America on the right
                track! thnx agn...TEF
