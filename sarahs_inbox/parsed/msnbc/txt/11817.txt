              MESSAGE:

              Sarah I was wondering     if You were paying attention to the presidential election. I was
              also wondering if You     possibly look into Ron Paul and possibly endorse this canidate. I am
              sure You have already     received emails of this sort already. I will thank You for You're
              time and I am glad We     have a honest governor out there from what I have heard from alot of
              Ron Pauls supporters.
