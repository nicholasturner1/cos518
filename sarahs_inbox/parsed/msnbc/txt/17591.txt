         It's amazing the bs that is being spewed by Halcro. Whatever he's being fed to fuel his
         anti-Agia rants is so off base as to almost be comical.



         If he's taken up Meg's offer to finally meet with us to hear facts, then let's take him up
         on it asap. Dr Anthony Scott and the other experts will share facts so that Halcro can not
         deny our offer to share factual info with him.



        Halcro does not need to know that we will have a number of folks there or I anticipate
        he'll then find a reason to not participate.



        Thank you.
