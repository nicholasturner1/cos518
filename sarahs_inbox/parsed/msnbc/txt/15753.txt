          MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin,




          I recently saw your appearance on the Glenn Beck show. You made such a positive
          impression on me. I think it would be fantastic if you were selected as VP running mate.




          I hope you will run for higher office in the future. Alaska is lucky to have such a
          competent, strong woman at the helm. You are an inspiration to us all.




          I look forward to seeing more of you in the political arena in the future.




                                                                1




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0018775
