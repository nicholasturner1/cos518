            What do you think about Privileged or Per for Human Rights (the seat Chris Hayes resigned from)? You had
            mentioned that once before. Privile aren t interested.
           Privileged or for Royalties? He didn't mention anything , I just know he followed the bill and testified in support in a
           couple of committees. He might not be interested b/c of the financial disclosure , just a thought tho.
