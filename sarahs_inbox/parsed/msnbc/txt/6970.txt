         Privileged will be great.




         I'll have to give this some thought.

         I followed up with Privile ed today. She ' s interested and willing to serve wherever we need
         her.  I think she would be great on LBC-and she would be the only woman and the chair.
         She would also be someone we could rely on.




         Do you have any good women in mind from Fairbanks / Interior that would be good for LBC? It
         would be great to have two women on there out of the five total members .   I'll cc gov so
         she knows what I'm thinking too. It may be that we go with Privile a or a guy named Privilege
         P67 if he pans out.
            ,




         Thanks Kris!
