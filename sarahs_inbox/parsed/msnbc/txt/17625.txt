         Governor ,   Chuck & Sally:



         I received word that Elmer Feltz, one of the recipients of the

         outstanding volunteer awards - and longtime Wasilla resident - passed

         away last night from the stroke he suffered over the weekend. I spoke

         to his wife, Rose, and the service is Saturday. There is a graveside

         service in Palmer at 1pm and a service at the Wasilla Senior Center at

         3pm.    Pastor Hanson is officiating. I plan on attending.



         David Skitt, who was also a recipient yesterday and recd Elmer's

         award on his behalf, took the award and card to the hospital

         yesterday.     I didn't realize that they've been longtime friends and

         used to volunteer ski patrol together.



         I'll get w/Michelle on a letter of condolence.



        Kris
