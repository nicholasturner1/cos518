              Subject: Proposed 12 AAC 36.500-550 Continuing Education for Professional Architects, Engineers and
                       Landscape Architects
              Dear Mr. Notti:

              Your Board of Architects, Engineers and Land Surveyors is moving forward to adopt regulation
              12 AAC 36.500-550 mandating Continuing Education for Professional Architects, Engineers and
              Landscape Architects at their upcoming August meeting. The stated purpose of the proposed
              regulation is "to maintain a continuing level of competency and standards for professional
              architects, engineers, and landscape architects, in order to promote the public health, safety and
              welfare within the State."

              The AELS Board provided notice of the proposed regulations in February 2007 and received
              public comments through April 2007. Comments were received from licensees, businesses,
              professional societies and State agencies. With exception of the professional societies (who sell
              continuing education), the vast majority of comments were opposed to the pending regulations.
              Some of the reasons for opposition include:
                - No acknowledgement of the cost of the proposed regulations (the Board has declared them to
                  be no cost despite assertions to the contrary by DOT Commissioner and DNR staff).
                - No quantitative cost/benefit analysis.
                - No acknowledgement of the additional administrative burden to DCCED to administer the
                  proposed regulations including audits, record keeping and litigation.
                - No demonstrated correlation between design professional's performance with mandatory CE
                  and those not submitting to a mandatory CE
                - No analysis to show the proposed regulations would accomplish their stated purpose.
                - Vague, subjective requirements will inevitably lead to disputes and litigation.

              I invite you to peruse the public comments. For your convenience I have attached
              several letters of opposition to the proposed regulations that were submitted by
              your sister agencies

              The AELS Board has failed to do their homework on 12 AAC 36.500-550, ignored valid public
              concerns and is proceeding with a regulation that could cost $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 per year
              (maybe more). The AELS Board's pursuit to adopt 12 AAC 36.500-550 is totally out of touch
              with the current Administration's philosophy of fiscal responsibility and responsible government

              I am requesting that your office require the Board to postpone adoption of 12 AAC 36.500-550
              Continuing Education for Professional Architects, Engineers and Landscape Architects until the
              impacts have been documented to the satisfaction of the Governor, OMB and are made available
              for public review/comment. Documentation should include:
                - Tangible evidence that mandatory CE will actually improve the public health, safety and
                  welfare within the State.
                - Quantitative cost benefit analysis (including who pays the cost and who receives the benefit)

              Please let me know if your office can fulfill this request. If you or anyone on your staff would
