 Hello,
 Just a quick update.

 The balance for the Family Petty Cash is $150. We've used $80. for b ball shoes and $20. reimbursed to the House
 petty cash fund (from when the Governor needed a quick $20 for Willow in December).
 The Jetta is in the garage. Security gave me a car wash coupon, so I'll run it through today and it will be ready to
 go when Bristol returns.

 Have a great weekend!
 Erika
