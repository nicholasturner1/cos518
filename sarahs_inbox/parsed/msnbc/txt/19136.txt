         I understand that you might want my opinion on the advisability = of coming to DC on
         October 9th to meet with one or more members of the = Congressional Delegation.



         I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy .  The congress
         will not be in session during the week of = October 8th, which is the Columbus day recess,
         and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.

        i WILL CALL kRIS AND Mike LATER today to discuss current = delegation relations and what
        we might do in response.
