              Hmmm- not good. This is the reason I flew to Anchorage, missing more of the special
              session, and it's what I told reporters yest. I'll turn around from my trip into kulis and
              head for the Anchorage office instead.

               Governor - I just spoke with McHugh Pierre. The deployment that we had on your schedule
               for 10: 00 a.m . today happened yesterday morning. There was no ceremony - it was just a
               handful that deployed for 45 days. Apparently it was continuation of group that went out
               Sunday evening (Lt. Gov) attended that one. Sorry for any inconvenience. Janice
