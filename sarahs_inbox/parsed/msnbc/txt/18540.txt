        Amen.




        ADN won't print if it runs anywhere else, so we submit there first then send to all other
        after ADN committs to running it on a certain date. Thanks!

         Sorry, the power has been out at my house since last night and my phone battery was out.
        I'm heading to a hotspot so I can fill in gaps and add my two cents. From the road...

         That's one of the criticisms I've heard too. Why are we referring to it as a tax when it
        is more of a royalty-it's "our share".

           Ok sounds great. I've tweaked some verbiage to get it down to 675 words, but still need
          the dollar amount plugged in... then I'm assuming all is well with it and it's good to go.
          It's written simply, be too many people are saying they just don't understand how a fiscal
          conservative could propose "taxing" industry. I had to explain the difference between
          taxing and sharing value of our oil. I did keep it simple, purposefully.

          Yes, I sent out but have not heard back on any changes or recommendations. Sharon also
         sent an email asking for info to be provided to her and Beth. I'll start making phone
         calls if I don't hear by tomorrow. Sharon said it is too late to run this weekend and she
         thought Wednesday would be the next best circulation.

          Kris- were you able to get the op_ed to this team? Unless I soon receive suggested
         changes/edits I'll just wait for the blank $ amount to be plugged in to the piece and then
         I'll ask ADN to run it. Then we'll submit to other publications after hearing from ADN.
