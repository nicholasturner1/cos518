            Could u do that for me - cut and paste. I'm calling Canadian officals for the next hours.



           The policy is ridiculous and I ' m disappointed anyone assumed the admin was all on board
           with it. I just don't have time to fix it - but her interpretation of IRS rules is odd on
           this one and I disagree with it.
