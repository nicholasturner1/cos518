          Commissioners,




        I wanted to pass on the resume of the top candidate for the Royalties Bd. Kristan is a
        community leader in the Mat-Su Valley, and a successful realtor with a BA and MA in
        Business Administration.  She's a good supporter, a quick study, and I think will be a
        good board member.  If you have questions please don't hesitate to call on me.




        Thanks,




        Ivy Frye



        Director of Boards and Commissions



                                                                   1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0001786
