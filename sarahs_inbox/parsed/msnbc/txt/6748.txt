             TO:       NFCSC Members

             FROM: Bob Douglas, President

             RE:       April 2007 Update and Action Alert!

             Good News - Bad News!
             The House Senate Conference Committee Report includes a one year reauthorization of the
             Secure Rural Schools and Communities Act. That is good news! The bad news is that the
             Senate (five year reauthorization) version was not accepted by the Conference Committee. The
             other bad news is that the President is expected to veto this bill.

             A New Emergency Supplemental is in the Planning Stages - Better News!
             Because of this, we will likely get a second bite at the apple. We believe based on our
             intelligence, that there is a better than ever chance to insert some version of the Senates five year
             reauthorization in the new supplemental spending bill, but only if we can increase the sense of
             importance of this issue and the urgency to act immediately among members of the House of
             Representatives.

             Action Alert
             We are told that the House Leadership team reports that they are not hearing from many
             members of the House that a multi-year reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools and
             Communities is an urgent need. Clearly our grassroots effort has been insufficient! We need to
             double our efforts this week and next so that instead we receive the report that the message has
             been delivered loudly and clearly and members of Congress from our states feel compelled to
             act now!

                                                                                                                  Page 4 of 5



             Action Needed Now!
                 1. Contact your member of Congress and ask them to do the following:
                     a. Personally speak to Leadership and strongly urge that the five year senate language be
                        included in the new Emergency Spending bill. Member to member contact is
                        essential. Member to Leadership contacts is even more important!

                2.    Fax a letter to House Leadership and the Chairman of the House Appropriations
                     Committee urging immediate action to reach agreement with Senate Leadership on
                     language that funds a five year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and
                     Communities Act and the inclusion of this language in the new Emergency Spending bill.

                          House Leadership - Speaker Nancy Pelosi
                          Fax #202-225-4188

                          House Appropriations - Congressman Dave Obey, Chairman
                          Fax #202-225-3240

                3. Contact your local newspaper and radio stations and make a case for why this extension
                   is important for your county and your schools and what will happen if funding is not
                   approved. Emphasize the following:

                     a. Congress has stated that this is an emergency and they must place language in the new
                        Emergency Spending bill to address the circumstances of rural schools and
                        communities.
                     b. This must be done now! It cannot wait for an elongated national policy debate over
                        other issues.
                     c. This is the best opportunity in the foreseeable future for Congress to stabilize support
                        for rural schools and communities for the next five years. Act now and avert the
                        disaster!

                Please take the time to Act Now! Without a high volume and immediate response, we will
                not get this done. With such a response, we may be able to convince the members of the
                House and their Leaders to take bold and decisive action. It's in your hands!

                A twenty-person strike team from the Coalition will be on the ground in DC all of next week
                to support and reinforce this grassroots advocacy and media campaign.

                Thank you for your efforts!
