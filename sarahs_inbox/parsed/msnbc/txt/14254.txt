           Dear Governor Palin,



           First of all congradulations are in order for your new Baby Boy. We are very happy for you
           and your family.

           lam writing you also to take a look at the coal to oil technology that is being strongly
           condidered in Montana and pushed by Governor Schweizer.

           As long as oil does not drop below $35 a barrel this is a very provitable venture and
           becouse of our huge coal reserves something that we should look at now.

           I found a link to this on Google so you might want to look at it. As our oil production is
           in a steady decline this looks very promising indeed.

           By the way we think you are doing a fabulous job. Sincerly yours Klaus Plikat & Family
