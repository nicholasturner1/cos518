         Maybe meeting with the KABATA investors in NY while I'm there? Or any of Pat Galvin's DOR
         issues that have taken him back east for Perm Fund investment meetings?

        Thanks. I do want to capitalize on my East Coast trip that week though. There may be other
        options hopefully.

          October 9th to meet with one or more members of the = Congressional Delegation.



         I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy .  The congress
         will not be in session during the week of = October 8th , which is the Columbus day recess,
         and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.

         i WILL CALL kRIS AND Mike LATER today to discuss current = delegation relations and what
         we might do in response.
