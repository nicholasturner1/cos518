        Tib- pls pass on to Eric Fry, info officer for dept of ed, that we appreciate his
        responsiveness to the criticism aimed at teacher performance program . He wrote a letter to
        the editor welcoming comments from the public . Very good - wish more of our info officers
        in every dept would also help us communicate with Alaskans in this manner.
