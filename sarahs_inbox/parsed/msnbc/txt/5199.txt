                fine that he's doing a lot of the work for us!
                that's the way i look at this - and that we don't have pride in authorship.

                  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: FEBRUARY 5, 2007

                                                 SENATOR BILL WIELECHOWSKI

                           Longevity Bonus Reapplications Bill Gets First
                                            Hearing

                  (JUNEAU) - Legislation to reinstate the Alaska Longevity Bonus Program will have its first
                  hearing in the Senate Health, Education & Social Services Committee on Wednesday , February
                  7th in Juneau.

                  Senate Bill 40 is sponsored by Sen. Bill Wielechowski (D - Anchorage).

                  "The longevity bonus was a promise made by the state to its pioneers," said Wielechowski. "It's
                  only fair we reinstate a program that helps seniors pay for essentials like health care and sky-
                  high home heating bills."

                  The legislation limits the program to seniors who qualified for the bonus before it was
                  eliminated. The seniors must remain residents of the state to participate in the program.
