        Megan,  this state needs AGIA! It is never a mistake to try. We can take the high road.
        Our Governor said we would be open and transparent and we were with Andrew. I would
        rather make sure we worked hard on every opportunity than wish later that we would have
        done more.  Its a great team!



        I like you suggestion for a response.              Tom
