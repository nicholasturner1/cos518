              Govemor-

              I just heard about the accident . I hope you are okay. I did get a call from Dennis Zaki with
              Alaskareport .com asking for details . I'm sure more media outlets will find out.
              May I share-

              You were rear ended at Glenn and Bragaw intersection.
              You are sore but suffered no major injuries
              You were alone in the vehicle
