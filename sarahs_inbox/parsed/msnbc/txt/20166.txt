              So standing at the podium with a spe ch- or will people be speaking off the cuff at the head
              table? I just don't want to be reading speech if instead I need to prepare tonight for a discussion
              instead.

               Governor,


               I have a call in to Julie Kitka and hope toy hear back soon. Because an estimated 90 people are supposed to attend,
               I would expect a podium.

               Also, I was trying to verify that you kn     or had met with, Dr. Gary Sobeloff? Tlingit leader? I thought you
               had, but Janice didn't see it in your schedule.

              Is this a speech at a podium, or roundtable discussion (meaning no speech)?

              Governor,

              Here are your remarks and event info. I'm still waiting on feedback for the remarks from several in your Juneau
              office, so there may be changes yet, as J nice may have mentioned. I've told them I need to get the remarks to
              you as early this evening as possible. I'v reworked the remarks, integrating several comments from Rhonda
              McBride. I will have Tara print your sp       off on cards for you tomorrow morning, as I have jury duty first thing.
             -Yay for civic responsibility© Anyway, I'll   t updated remarks to you ASAP, and please do not hesitate to let me
              know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

              Thank you!

              P.S. Senator Inouye's (HI) last name is pronounced 'ih-no-way."
