         Hi -




         Here is a draft press release from the governor's office announcing the AGIA RFA, to be
        distributed at the Tuesday, 11 a.m. roundtable discussion on the RFA and statewide
        thereafter.  It was a joint effort between Bruce Anders and I, and we would like your
        review and comment before we finalize it, preferably no later than 10 a.m. Please send
        changes to Bruce, and CC me. Thanks.




         -Dan Saddler
