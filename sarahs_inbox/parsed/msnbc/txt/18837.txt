           Mike just called. Said he's drafted a statement. He just sent it and

           we'll marry that to the draft letter for quick turn around in the hour.

          It came in late last week. Joe forwarded it over the weekend. We

          weren't aware Hollis was going to make it public. We're drafting a

          response for you. It will be done shortly, and can be forwarded to

          McAllister today.
