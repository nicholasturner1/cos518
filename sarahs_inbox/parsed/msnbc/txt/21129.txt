           Bristol wants to get there early. We're downstairs and will be looking for coffee until we
           har from you. She left a msg on Tom's phone.

           If you would prefer to rest, Tom and I can get Bristol to the studio. If you would prefer
           to go, they will have a place for you to sit and watch on a monitor.
