                Originally 3 federal earmarks ($100M, $75M, $48M) dedicated to Gravina. Of the
         three major earmarks, only two were changed by Sec. 186, PL 109-115 in December 2005. the
         third earmark was specifically directed to the road work associated with the bridge (Sec.
         1702 #3323) and according to FHWA interpretation, may only be used for that purpose.



                Two ($100M and $75M) of the 3 were "un earmarked" and become "flexible" funds
         subject to regulatory distribution between National Highway System (48' - Gravina Bridge
         is eligible only for this), Alaska Highway System roads, community roads and trails and
         recreational access. The department was directed by the previous Governor to give the
         maximum amount of funds possible to Gravina. Under regulations we are required to adhere
         to as a member of the federal highway system, that meant distributing 48 percent of these
         so-called "flexible" funds to NHS projects. You can find a much more laborious explanation
         of this at 17 AAC 05.155-200.



                Additionally only 85% of the amount is actually available for a state to spend
         based on federal appropriations, that is known as the obligation limit.



         o           $100M     X 48%    X 85% = $40.8M



         0           $   75M   X 48%     X 85 % = $30.6M



                                                                    1

                  $71.4M



                   That $71.4 million comes to Alaska in unequal increments over a five-year period.



                  However about $8 million had to obligate by end of FFY 06 and was spent on other
           "flexible fund" eligible projects.



                 That leaves roughly $63 million. Three-fifths (third appropriation from the five-
          year life of the bill) of that works out to be about $36 million, which is what we have on
          hand today.



                 The $48M earmark is actually 85V of total plus match = $44.5. This was earmarked
          specifically for access road work on the Gravina Island side and is not available for any
          other project.




                   $14 million* in earmarks from TEA-21 spent between 1998 - 2004 on the NEPA required
          EIS



                 $6 million of GF was appropriated for replacement of the airport ferry by the state
          legislature for FY08. That is state General Fund money and not reflected in the federal
          funds above.




                   $398 million need for build out in 2012 (inflationary estimate).



                 Below are the three " gravina" earmarks in SAFETEA - LU. (The $100 and $48 million
          earmarks were earmarked from regular formula funds)
