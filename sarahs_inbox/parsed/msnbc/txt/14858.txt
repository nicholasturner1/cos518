           Dear Governor Palin,




           I wish to extend to you, your husband and your children my heartfelt congratulations at
           the birth of your son. I also want to express to you my admiration and thankfulness for
           your stand for the dignity of all life. As the parent of a disabled child I understand
           some of the challenges that you will face, but I will be praying for you to experience the
           loving grace and power of God in you lives.



           May God richly bless you and your family,

          MESSAGE:

          Congratulations , Governor Palin , on the birth of Trig . My dad , Bob Moore from Wasilla,
          told me about it before I read Dr Al Mohler ' s blog about it. Here's the article.
          http ://www.albertmohler.com/blog_read . php?id=1144 It's very encouraging . Dad was glad to
          have met with you a couple of weeks ago . We talk about many things, but the first thing he
          mentioned to me was the birth of your new son.
