           MESSAGE:

           Dear Governor Palin:




           While we have not officially opposed the Curry Ridge Project in Denali State Parks, we do
           have concerns that it will be marketed by some as THE Denali experience, thereby
           discouraging visitors to go farther north to Denali National Park and Preserve, Healy,
           Nenana and Fairbanks. It is a feasible theory that this project will not benefit ALL of
           Alaska's tourism entities. Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.
