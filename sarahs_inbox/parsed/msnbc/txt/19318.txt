             Great. And I'll ask Sharon to make sure I have an Alaskan map there so I can point out via an
             overlay the Richardson Hwy route vs Parks Hwy route. Also to point out where the Foothills are
             in relation to Prudhoe - and even where Cook Inlet is. Remember some folks, including some
             reporters, may not know where were talking about taking the resource. Thanks!

              We'll be rolling out a plan tomorrow to announce our involvement with ANGDA and Enstar to
              feed interior markets with cook inlet gas, and eventually new gas finds on the slope. I have
              questions (see below), but this is basically an in-state All Alaska line (not LNG, though), kind of
              an agia-lite project partnership.

             Thanks Tom, I agree completely with the sentiment . This is a big deal
             for Alaska, and we need to make sure we launch it correctly. Our
             strength has always been our candid internal discussions ; challenging
             each other to make what's good even better.
             I'm also coming in late to this exchange, but would like to add a little

              I am late getting into this discussion but some thoughts for the friends
              I am absolutely proud to be with . I think the collective we are doing
              great. We have been through a really tough time and all of us have been
              personally attacked for doing what is right . That is stressful. Seems
              like this has taken an eternity , yet we are soooo close to the goal.

              I have had the opportun' to hear and be part of the proposal being
              developed for Monday Privileged or Our success has been to
              question, argue and h en nurse ves or the next round of questions.
              Let's keep it up. Better in house than out house.

              I hope you have a special July 4th. As we celebrate our country's
              freedom, I think in our own way we are now fighting for our state's
              freedom . God bless you all. Tom

              Ok, got it. I appreciate your take on this and I sincerely appreciate
              all your hard work on this, and AGIA. It was interesting to watch
              Stevens the other day though in our presser as he rolled out his "energy
              plan" with caveats left and right explaining these were "ideas,
              proposals... needed to be fleshed out in DC, etc," obviously having
              learned not to get himself in a box with some solid PLAN that he'd later
              perhaps have to amend. We've rolled out things/timelines before that we
              later had to amend, so with this Enstar plan I'd like privileged or P

             Here is what I believe to be the "final " concept paper for the "In-State
             Gas" Conference on Monday. This paper has the blessing of both ANGDA
             and ENSTAR and this is the concept we are all working off. And,
             hopefully, their comments will be pegged off it as well. The following
             people will be at the press event, although other representatives from
             the entities may show-up:



             ENSTAR:

             Gene Dubay, Executive VP & COO for Continental Energy Systems (owner
             company of ENSTAR)

              I have advised everyone that the press conference is scheduled for
             1:00pm on Monday, July 7th, in your Anchorage Conference Room. They
             have also been advised that you will be announcing this formation of a
             project development venture (a public/private partnership) and will be
             laying out the concept, followed by Gene Dubay, Scott Heyworth and
             Harold Heinze making brief statements. I have asked everyone to be at
             your offices about 15 minutes ahead of time as you may want to go into
             the Conference Room together.



             I will be using this paper to put together some talking points for you,
             Governor. Should you wish anything else, please let me know . My cell
             phone #: 317-4728.



             Also, we have identified a series of people to pre-message this
             announcement to and we will be making those calls on Sunday evening and
             early Monday.



             Thanks for all your support, Governor, and for your recognition that
             dealing with in-state gas needs is critical! It was a great insight
             that I believe will push the AGIA License over the edge!
