              It all works out.



              By the way, on Kate... in the months ahead if you have a speech that has substantive policy
              in it but you want it to have more of her touch, you can give an almost complete speech to
              her to let her put the "Kate flair" to it (which is really her trying to sound like you--
              the speechgiver).
