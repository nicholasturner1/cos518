            These need to go to Mark Kelsey. He is doing all issues on Vets, Alaska military youth
            academy and DMVA issues.

           MESSAGE:

           My name is CW3 Tim Worthy and I am with D company 123rd AVN out of Fort Wainwright. My
           Company will be deploying later this month and I would like to see about getting an Alaska
           flag to take with us so that we can take pictures to send back to represent Alaska. I
           have heard for $25 I can buy one that has been flown over the state capital, if so I would
           like to purchase one. Can you please point me in the right direction? Thank you.
