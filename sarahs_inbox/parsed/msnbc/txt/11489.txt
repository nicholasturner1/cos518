              Wish I had my own media list so I could just hit "send " and get these things answered.
              Again - I love the team . But the interal over - analyzing drives me crazy when we miss good
              response opportunities . Further- the media knows where to find me, versus not finding Tom,
              Pat, Bruce, etc... they want answers soon be then they simply move on to the next issue
              without our response when we miss it . I know you know this already !    And I agree - Alaskans
              want to hear from us - what we're doing , where we ' re leading them.

              Timing ' s everything so hopefully this gets pumped out quick.



              Otherwise the WRONG mssg " jells " in the public which makes setting the record straight
              even harder .  We must learn to react quickly - which can be done without seeming
              overreactive .  Your suppoters like to see that your organization is engaged in these huge
              issues.

             And I know team members want time to chew on this , but as has already happened this
             morning with KTW finding me at the NEA speech and wanting responses to CP's letter - we
             can't blow any tinmely opportunity to set the record straight , asap, and lay out facts
             when we are asked . Better yet , to be pro-active and anticipate what the public is wanting
             answered . Obvious to me is the public ' s questions : " why is she refusing to talk to CP"
             (not true , but that ' s what they ' re hearing ), and "is it true she just doesn't understand
             how to get this project built " ( shoot - don't defend me on this , but our team of experts
             had better be defended or Alaskans will continue to believe the big , pretty , expensive ads
             that CP pays for to tell Alaskans we're , essentially , naive, stubborn and idiotic).



             The response does need to be sent . It's fine , with minor corrections ... I don't want us to
             over - think the response and miss opportunity to speak to Alaskans . I WILL be asked,
             continually , until we release a statement.
