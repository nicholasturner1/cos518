            and/or mat maid issues. she's at a good time in life with kids graduating... ready to re-join
            workforce. she said reading the coverage of matmaid the last couple of days has pushed her to
            the point of knowing she can take me up on my request for her assistance.

            i told her I'd talk to Tom, find out what's needed, where she'd be needed, and we'd work with her
            on where to plug her in.
