              MESSAGE:

             Governor Palin,



             Have you decided on who you will be supporting for President? Might I suggest that you
             support. Governor Romney. Ethics, both personal and public, are a critical talent to have
             in place as a politician. Gov. Romney has integrity as a foundation that he has built his
             life upon. I know how.important this is to you and would therefore recommend that you
             support a candidate who feels the same.



             Thanks,



              Robert Litwack
