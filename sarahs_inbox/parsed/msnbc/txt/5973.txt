          Met with Vic Fisher today- he's disappointed we didn't select some outstanding applicants
          for LBC, including former Frbnks city manager and attorney Patick Cole, plus another
          experinced municipal official (mr. Ringstad) and instead chose an anti-government
          individual with no local issues background that LBC deals in. (His summary, not mine). I
          am not sure if Ivy shared that we had good candidates apply for LBC, but I do remember her
          suggesting Lavelle Wilson, from Tok, whom was chosen.



          We need Dan Sadler soon, ok?
