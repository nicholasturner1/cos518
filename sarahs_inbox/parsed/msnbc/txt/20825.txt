              Rather than wait for additional information from Adak , can someone please call the Mayor now and get the
              information over the phone so we can complete the securing of the loan, process it , and get the loan proceeds
              disbursed to Adak.

              City of Adak applied for a $400,000 Bulk Fuel loan on the 9th of September on the same day we asked for

              the loan . We can process a loan very quickly if we get the information from the applicant . This will be their

              Governor:

              There is a fuel issue in Adak . The local supplier is refusing to extend further credit to the city for fuel. The city
              owes roughly $500,000 now. The city and the supplier (Aleut Corp.) are talking to try and resolve the issues.
              There is plenty of fuel in Adak , the supplier is just unwilling to sell more to the city on credit.

              I will look into whether either of the loan programs we just expanded with increased loan limits in the recent
              special session could be used by Adak to get through the crisis, when they will receive their municipal revenue
              sharing payments, etc. and report back. If these programs or others are available to help Adak we will let them
              know right away.

              Randy

              Greg:

              Please let me know whether Adak has received its municipal revenue sharing payments, and if not, when
              they are due to be paid.

              Also, please let me know whether the bridge loan program administered at Commerce that we just
              increased in special session to a $750,000 maximum limit is available to the City of Adak.

              Also, if there is any emergency loan or grant sources, please let me know.

              Sarah:

              Are there any loan or grant programs that Adak can apply for that are administered by AEA?
