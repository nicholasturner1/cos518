          Dear Mr. Chapoton:




          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

         Good Job Governor Sarah, on the veto action. I just read the Frontiersman story on

         our state ' s budget this year and am impressed by your decision processes on what

         not to pay for.



         As for Lyda Green complaining about not knowing your new rules ...             as if it would

         have mattered if she did months ago in Juneau .         She's a good lady, but she found out

         your plan the right way. The way that something Happens ,            as opposed to getting

         talked about.



         You're a mover, Mrs . Governor .      Just don't fool with my guns, and I'm your man.
