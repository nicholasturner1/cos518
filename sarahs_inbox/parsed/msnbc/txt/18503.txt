         Governor - The call to Senator Wagnor we will be placing to him at 12:00

         p.m. tomorrow, Friday, 09.07.07.          He wants to speak with you directly

         concerning the recent Board of Fish meeting. He also wants to apologize

         to you as he felt he put you on the spot recently and he normally

         doesn't do this. We can not do this after the DPS meeting as if it runs

         over you then have the Lt. Gov. Thanks, Janice



        Senator Wagnor Contact: 398-4200 (cell)
