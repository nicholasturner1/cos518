         We may need relevant cabinet members to touch base with leggies re: Energy Bill. Their
         visit to Juneau this week should be put to good use, see below:

         Marty: I'd like cabinet members to be down there to support AGIA team, touch base with
         leggies, etc this week- we can turn the visit into a cabinet meeting luncheon. Does
         Thursday sound good? Or before that?

         Hannah and Jake · a hug from the Palins today!

            Mike - let's plan cabinet mtg in the form of a luncheon at the house this week, if we
         can assume enough members can be in Juneau . It's a historic week if the AGIA vote is
         taken, so maybe more will be there in Juneau for that ( and in support of AGIA team). We
         can do a bit of an informal lunch w / roundtable setting and we'll literally go around the
         tables getting updates from everyone of their dept activities.
