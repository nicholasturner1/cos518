         As we discussed last night, you would like the announcement of the PFD amount this year to
         be made in the bush rather than a big ballroom in Anchorage or Fairbanks.     Based on our
         discussion , I got the impression that you would like to be there to make the announcement.
         The announcement should be made September 19, 20, or 21.



         I asked the PFD folks to look at some statistics to see if any bush community stands out
         in any way. So far, I have the following:



         Scammon Bay has the highest percentage of kids applying for PFD's (52.5%).



         If we're just looking for a rural hub to use, and we stick to the AK Air locations, we can
         choose from: Kotzebue, Nome, Barrow, King Salmon, Bethel, and Dillingham.



         Let me know how you want to proceed.



         -Pat
