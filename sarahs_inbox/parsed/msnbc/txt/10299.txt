              Just picking up some fresh fruit and salad, skim milk and cheese would be great. There's
              still plenty of freezer food that we'll consume, plus leftovers from reception. The kids
              need the fruit and vegatables though.



              And those steaks are great, so having them would be appreciated.



              Otherwise, I'll just run to the store if the kids need anything                else . Thanks!

              Hello,



              Of course I'm already thinking of food while the family is in town for the Open House.
              Just send me a shopping list if you'd like to have things purchased in advance. We'll
              need to purchase items for the Open House, so we'll be shopping at Foodland (A&P) and
              Costco.  Let me know if you'd like steaks, chicken, etc-prepared for when you arrive on
              Wednesday.
                                                                     2




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01 _0008336
