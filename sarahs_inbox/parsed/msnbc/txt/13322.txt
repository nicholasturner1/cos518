             MESSAGE:

             Dear Governor Palin,



             I was very disappointed that Senator French killed the Partial Birth Abortion ban and
             parental consent bills in committee after passing the house. Hard to believe that the
             senator, a proclaimed Catholic, so directly contradicts Jesus and his own Church. He now
             shares some culpability in each life so taken.



             Please governor , can you somehow resurrect this legislation that a majority of us support.
             Continue the good struggle and congratulations on the birth of your beautiful new son.



            Thank you,

             Jon Agosti
