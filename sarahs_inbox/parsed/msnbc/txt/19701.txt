                Subject: FYI - Delivery of letter in support of motor fuel tax bill

              Governor.

              Just an FYI . A letter I drafted to the chairs of the committees where our motor fuel tax bills are being heard is
              being delivered to all legislators today. It talks mainly about the benefits of the suspension of the motor fuel tax to
              the fishing industry . Janice has a copy of the letter for your reading file. Kelly signed off.
