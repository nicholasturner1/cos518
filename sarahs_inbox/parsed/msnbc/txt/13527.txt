            Looks good and I'm sure it's ready to go-now.

             Okay -- Jessalynn is making that change. So now the first paragraph

             reads like this:




             Governor Sarah Palin today approved the State Board of Education and

             Early Development's appointment of Larry LeDoux to serve as

             Commissioner .     Former Deputy Commissioner Barbara Thompson has served as

              Interim Commissioner since August 18, 2007.



              PS -- I called KTUU and the Anchorage Daily News and gave them a

              heads -up this is coming tonight.
