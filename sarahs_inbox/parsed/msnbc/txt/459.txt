  Subject : FYI- Telephone Switch over Thurs. 5/10 (Cisco IP)
  Hello,

  This Thursday at 2:00pm . the House will switch over to the new Cisco IP phones . These are the same
  phones used in the Anchorage offices, but we ' re the first location in Juneau to have them installed . I think
  we will also have wireless capabilities for the computers on Thursday.

  Where would you like the wireless phone (only 1) upstairs? If I don't hear back I'll put it in the master
  bedroom.

  Most of the intercom numbers will stay the same, but you'll have a new list on the phones. I can run
  through the basics of the "how tos" with the girls and make a cheat sheet to leave by the phones. There's
  also a hand out that will be under the phones.

  Finally, the House will have decent phones instead of ones that are one step above the rotary dial!
  Erika
