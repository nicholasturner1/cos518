            Yes to the letter and flag that we could send.



            Mike- is there any expectation that flags would be lowered in this case? Sounds like he
            wasn't a legislator.

            May I suggest a,letter of condolence and send a flag that has been flown

            over the Capitol building?

            Mike:



            Lew Williams did pass away on Saturday from cancer.

            He was 83 .    The obituary in the ADN today ( Page A-7)

            mentions that he served on local school boards and

            various state boards but does not mention that he was

            ever elected as a legislator and I do not believe that

            he was.



           Mayor Weinstein called me last night to request that

           we consider flying the flags at half - staff . I told him

            I would pass on the request.



           Randy



           I will be working out of the Department of Law offices

           today and meetng with Talis.           My cell is   Privilege
