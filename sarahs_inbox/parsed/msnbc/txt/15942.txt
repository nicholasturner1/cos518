            Leo/Talis- I'm not clear on why DOT would not want to release the 80-page KABATA document
            that ADN requested under foia last week. Please release the kababta info so no one's
            speculating that our admin is hiding any Knik Arm info from the public.



           Also, pls set up with Janice a time for kabata folks to give us an update and to share
           their plans to move the project forward. Thank you
