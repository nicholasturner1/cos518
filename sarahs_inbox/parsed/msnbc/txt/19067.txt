         not answering a-mails does nothing to help restore the public trust and faith in our
         elected officials . i am very disappointed in your lack of communication regarding issues
         near and dear to me and my family . seems like nothing has changed except the crooks are
         finally getting caught . i think they are all guilty by association . they all knew whats
         been going on and yet they have let it go on for years and years ............... so
         sad .............. yup ! kill all the cows so we dont have to deal with the orphans
         thats wildlife management at its best ............. so sad , let nature take its
         course ................. doug
