          MESSAGE:

          Dear Governor Palin -




          I recently read the article concerning the birth of your son. My simple message to you is
          to tell you how much an encouragement you are to me and so many others. Living according
          one's beliefs is something that should always be celebrated and recognized. Thank you for
          your testimony to living according to your beliefs.

          I hope and pray that your family is blessed through this entire experience of life and
          family.



          Matt Reger
