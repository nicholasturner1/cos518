              Dear Ms . Okland, I have received your request to the Governor and have added

              it to her pending scheduling requests list.              I'll let you know if this might

              work after I am able to discuss it with the Governor.



              Sincerely, Kari Spencer

             Web mail from : Ms. Linda Okland

              address: 2702 McKenzie Dr. Anchorage AK 99517



              MESSAGE:

              Dear Sarah,



              Congratulations on your election! I knew when you were one of Howard's

              bosses at AOGCC that you would go

              far in politics, but I hardly expected to see you in the Governor' s Mansion

              so soon.



              I will be making my annual visit to Juneau with the PAX foreign                exchange

              students March 19-22 . We usually

              make an appointment with the Governor and/or Lt . Governor while we are at

              the capitol. This year I

              wondered if you and your family would like to try something a little

              different . Would your daughters be

              interested in hosting the group for a pizza party at the Mansion?



              This year I have ten students from Indonesia ( 2), Malaysia ,           Philippines,

              Ghana, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,

              Armenia ,   Ukraine ,   and Russia . These students are currently attending high

              school in Anchorage. They are

              recipients of US State Department scholarships as part of its "citizen

              diplomacy" initiative.




                                                                    2



                                                                                                                P RAGS P01 _0000403

              While in Juneau we will be staying at Schaible House, The Global Connections

              Club at UAS is planning a

              dinner for the group one of the evenings. We may also make a presentation to

              a history class at UAS. The

              students will also spend one day at the capitol visiting legislators and

              attending a floor session. If

              time and weather permit, we will visit Mendenhall Glacier and the Museum.

              The schedule is somewhat

              uncertain because we have to wait and see when there will be a floor session

              and then work around it.



              If Willow and Bristol (and Piper if she wants) are interested in meeting the

              students, have them e-mail

              me. I know the students would love to hear what it is like to be the

              daughter of the Governor.



              Hoping to see you in Juneau,
