             Subject:                Senate


             Come to think about it our three major pieces of legislation: Ethics Reform, AGIA and ACES
             all have some down to the wire in this perplexing scenerio that almost leads to panic (or
             desperation) by some legislators... all because Senate leadership has chosen to hold on
             and "mull" until the last minute. What an unnecessary practice they're in, as in each case
             we've provided enough time and information to allow them a better process and product.




             Wonder how long leggies will put up with this frustrating practice caused by any leader.
