              MESSAGE:

              I have worked in the oil industry for 25 years. The last 18 years I have been with the
              largest privately held Seismic company in the US. I have designed 3D seismic surveys and
              have been involved in all aspects of research and development. Our company has very close
              ties to Shell, Conoco/Phillips, BP/amoco and Exxon, plus numerious other companies that
              are currently exploring in Alaska. I am working on some ideas for seismic shoots that are
              needed in your state that will help prove up and develop reserves there. I would like to
              start a dialog with youre office to help in planning these potential projects. We will be
              meeting with the head of shell's Alaska group next week. I would like to coordinate an
              effort that will maybe employ Alaskian citizens and benifit the Alaskian people, but I
              need your direction. I would like to talk and possibly meet with you on what we can
              provide.
