              Subject: final copy of IOGCC speech
             Can you forward me a final copy of your IOGCC speech so that the IOGCC staff can use it for a release
             about his morning 's conference?
             They won 't focus entirely on the speech , but will include other business (such as the MOU).

             They are working on deadline now.
