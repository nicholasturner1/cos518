             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on your new baby. My daughter has a 10 year old boy with DS. She had
             lost twins at birth a few years earlier. When I heard she had a DS child I showed my
             disappointment.  "But, mom," she said, "he's alive." Isn't God good! Thank you for being
             a strong prolifer and showing to the nation the value of a single life. You are blessed,
             as are we. It takes a lot more patience with a special needs child, but what an
             opportunity to see God's grace at work. Again, congratulations and God's continual
             blessing to you and your family.
