            we've heard very little, except from some democrat legislators who were opposed to the
            abortion bills being added to the call of the special session on AGIA. Other random
            responses were that the letter was well-received among those who are sick of Lyda's
            games.... the numbers are MAY.



            I will reach out to the legislators you've mentioned below and see if they have thoughts
            to share regarding this issue.

            I sent this to Sean: and have u guys heard what lawmakers want us to do with abortion
            bills?



            Ltgov: I'm waiting to hear from friendly leggies on what they'd like to see us do with
            calling for session on abortion bills. If/when called, it will be in Anchorage. And very
            short in duration.  Any advice on this to add to what Coghill, Dyson, Dallstrom, et al may
            share?
