            Hi Marty,



            Thank you.      70 wells!     Unbeliavable.



            Sharon was getting with Balash on this to run it. I told her Tom felt a quote from the
            Gov was appropriate for something this big.



            F

            Gov, All,

            Attached is the ENI announcement which was made yesterday. I think Frank Bailey was
            working w/DOG on a Gov's press announcement.

            Marty
