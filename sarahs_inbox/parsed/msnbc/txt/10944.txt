                Ron Stroman,

                I have just checked my mail today. I still have not received any notification from DOT of the Meeting for
                this evening. It is peculiar that I did receive mail postmarked January 5th from NJ, and Mail postmarked
                from Anchorage Dated January 7th, but I have not received mailings you state were sent on December
                31, 2007.

                Please reply to me promptly as to your willingness to reschedule this meeting.
                Thank You,
                Cheryl Fuglestad

                 Hi Ron,
                 No, I did not receive notice of the meeting, no one I have spoke to has received their notice. I really do
                 believe you need to
                 Give us 30 days notice for these meetings as per AS 44.62.190. It appears to many of us that DOT is
                 trying to have SCERET MEETINGS, with only the chosen fFEW. I request that you cancel this meeting
                 and reschedule with the proper notice.
                 Thanks, Linda
