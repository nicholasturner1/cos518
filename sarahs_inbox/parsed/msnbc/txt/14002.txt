           MESSAGE:

           I think the representation in Juneau is mostly corrupt and/or ineffective.



           Stick it to them on the budget.



           We don't need the petty park projects like we need the State infrastructure projects you
           proposed.



           Don't let the legislature win here.



          At the same time, I am a little miffed at the arial wolf hunting fiasco. The voters of
          Alaska don't want it right now. There are other ways to control wolf population than to
          use methods that give Alaska bad press. My mother keeps calling about how barbaric we are
          on the issue! I'm dying here... please no arial wolf hunting.
