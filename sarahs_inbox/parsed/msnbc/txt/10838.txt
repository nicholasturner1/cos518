            Governor - from the newspaper article, it sounds like an internal

            management decision in order for the department to manage within the

            existing budget.        I will defer to Commissioner Lloyd on this one. Karen

             Mike- why'd the fish gate         ($ 55g) get cut out of fish and game budget?

             Out of a $10m budget this isn't a good cut.

                Donuts? I'll have to think on that one... yesterday I was in the Atwood elevator and a woman gets in the
                elevator with me (with two other passengers). She looks at me twice, hesitates, then says, "You're the
                lieutenant governor, aren't you?" I said, "Yes, I'm Sean." She said, "You're much nicer looking in person
                than on tv." To which I kind of blushed and said, "Thank you." Then, she said, "You look much...(long
                pause then a blurt..) bigger on N." She smiled and walked off the elevator. So, I look at donuts with
                different eyes now.

               Donuts tomorrow morning in the AGIA war room. 14th floor @ DNR.

               You're invited. I'll bring the donuts, I'll meet you on our floor at 9am, then we'll walk down with the grub to thank
               the team at 9:15.

               Tara- can we get a couple pots of coffee to bring down too? Thanks!
