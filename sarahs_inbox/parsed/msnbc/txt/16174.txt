              MESSAGE:

              I sincerely wish that Governor Palin would seriously consider the vice presidential
              position if offered. I, as well as others across the US, feel that Mrs. Palin is.the
              perfect choice for VP. I feel that if she were the vice president, the whole country would
              benifit from her expertise and obvious common-sense.   Taking the VP position is not a
              rejection or abandonment of her homestate, but rather an opportunity to benifit the entire
              nation the way that she has benifitted Alaska. If offered the VP position on the
              republican ticket, I urge her to take it and run on a national level.
