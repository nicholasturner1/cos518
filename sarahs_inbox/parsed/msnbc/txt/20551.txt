                Governor Palin, AG Colberg, Commissioners, and others,

                Here's a brief synopsis on the hearing APOC held today in light of the complaint filed by an individual on
                the state's Information that DNR placed on its website:

               The hearing started at approximately 12:30, and went until six p.m., with a few brief recesses to gather
               additional information that APOC thought would be useful. Both parties presented oral argument and
               evidence/exhibits. Ed Fogels testified on a number of questions . I reiterated many times throughout that
               the legislature had provided this appropriation so that even if the information that the State distributed had
               the effect of influencing the outcome of the election, the State would not be in violation of AS 15.13.145.
               The "effect of influencing the outcome of an election" language is specifically found in AS 15.13.145(b),
               and was purposefully used by the legislature to shield state representatives from claims that they violated
               this statute. Further, I asserted that the appropriation covered state information and did not violate AS
               15.13. 145, even if the information would be construed as advocacy ; that's because the legislature made
               the appropriation based on the precise language in AS 15.13.135(b).

               At six p. m., the Commission went into private deliberations and said they would call the parties and
               advise of its oral order on the cxmplaint, with the hope of doing so this evening . In an oral order issued at
               8:20 pm, while finding that the legislature had appropriated funding for the State to educate the public on
               BM4 and the large mine permitting process , APOC directed DNR to remove from its website the
               information that it posted on Aug. 19th regarding the two matters. DNR staff are in the process of doing
               this. APOC has also ordered all state officials to refrain from "publicly advocating" against BM #4. APOC
               has ordered the parties to meet and see if they can alter the website to the agreement of both DNR and
               sponsors of the ballot, or if DNR proposes ways in which it could change some of the text in the website
               such that APOC finds that the text is "fair and neutral" language on the ballot measure.

                Thanks. Could I get some talking points on yesterday 's case filing ? We might want to do a press release hailing
                the one ruling , and then defending ourselves against the new case.

               Governor, attached below are Ed Fogel 's quick comments on the APOC ruling. I wanted you to see these right
               away. Ruth is already working with Talis/Craig and we all will be getting together tomorrow morning at 8:30 to
               decide the right course of action.

               We still feel that DEC,Law and DNR worked hard to give the correct honest evaluation.


               To: Tom, Marty,

               The APOC Commission just ruled that our website is not educating the public in a "fair" manner, and cited several
               specific examples. They cited not only the legislative intent for the $25,000 appropriation, but also several other
               election statutes, and a 1992 AG's opinion. The bottom line is that they feel that to be fair, the proponents of the
               ballot measure should have some level of agreement to our website.

               The Commission ordered us to meet with the complaining party tomorrow and try to either develop website
               language that is mutually agreeable, or to allow them to insert rebuttal language after sections of our website that
               they find objectionable. We have been ordered to appear with the other party before the Commission at 2:00 pm
               tomorrow. the Commission will either then bless our new site, or for us to kill the site for the duration.

               The Commission ordered that the website is to be pulled immediately (which I have initiated), and ordered that state
               officials cease to advocate for or against ballot measure 4. We can get more clarification on this order tomorrow at
               2:00. The Commission made no mention of the Governor's statement at the press conference in their order.

               Ed
