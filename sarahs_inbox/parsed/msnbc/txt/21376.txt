             It's just unbelievable though that Jay chooses to be so disrespectful to Pat. And as Jay
             feeds Fagan and others I have to pray that people have their eyes wide open to the
             deception he spews.

             I just lost any respect that I might have had for Jay no matter how little that was. I am
             struggling with the thought of telling him that after the session.   Please don't let
             these type of people affect you. We appreciate you and Alaskans just got another example
             to see the difference between ugly politics and doing the job right.   Tom

             likes of Jay.

              Pat,

              Your comments to ramras were right on-he was way out of line. You're right, we're here to
              restore public confidence and the governor has to run the entire state, not attend
              committee hearings to make jay feel better. Kee up the good work. I'm here to help you
              guys anyway I can!
