           John Katz had excellent comments in response to Dillon's questions on this the other day.
           Did you all see those? They should be shared with Cockerham... Meg also chimed in on this
           issue the other day, I'll forward her comments be reporters need to understand the gist of
           all this - it was our congressional. delegation telling us over a year ago to lay off the
           federal requests, we obeyed.

           Subject: Senator Murkowski




           FYI as you will likely see Senator Murkowski tomorrow and her chief of staff Karen
           (Knutson) at the Iditarod. After you and I spoke this afternoon , Karen called me to tell
           mn that Sean Cockerman is doing a .story on earmarks and that he interviewed Murkowski's
           office.  According to Karen they kept it, positive; respect for the Governor , etc.   She is
           frustrated because she feels that, the media is using this to try to divide . ( Sharon, I'm
           not sure if we were contacted or provided a statement?)



           On another subject, I told Karen that the 18th looks good for lunch but that I'd have to
           get back with her to finalize and confirm for sure.
