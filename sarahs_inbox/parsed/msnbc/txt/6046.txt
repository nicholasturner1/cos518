         Attn : Pat Shier , Director

         6th Floor State Office Building

         Dear Director Shier:



        After too many months of calls and letters to your division and Premera because of
        Premera ' s ineptitude , lack of professionalism and courtesy , and common sense, I am forced
        to write you and copy Commissioner Annette Kreitzer and Governor Sarah Palin.



        According to division employee Missouri Smyth who I spoke to on 6/13 / 07 I would receive a
        call within 2 days from the division ' s complaint office . Well , as you can see, it is now
        another 2 weeks and nobody has called me . Since this initial problem began 9 months ago
        and has escalated into multiple problems caused by Premera I believe I have been more then
        patient and understanding and request your immediate intervention and resolve to matters
        that have affected me financially and consumed enormous amounts of my time and energy
        while Premera shows how little they care and obviously how inefficient they are. When one
        has to mail and Fax the same item 4-5 times as I did my daughter ' s authorization for
        release of her records ( she is 20 ) something is obviously very wrong . Changing from Aetna
        to Premera was a huge mistake.
                                                                  1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01 _0002849

         Also , in Ms Smyth ' s case or any employee allegedly forwarding something for someone else
         to resolve it would seem prudent for that employee doing the forwarding to follow it up to
         make sure a promised contact has in fact been made . When I was a Compliance Officer for
         the Division of Environmental Conservation such a practice was mandatory! Thank you for
         your immediate assistance.




                                Sincerely,




                                Robert J. Faro
