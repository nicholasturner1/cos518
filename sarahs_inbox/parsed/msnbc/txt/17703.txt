           Kari,

           I wanted to see if I could get in to see Governor Palin for 20 minutes any time today or any time this week before
           she leaves town? Of course , only if time allows and the governor is up for it.

           I need confirmation on a couple of house keeping items before she travels this week . Several are re-
           appointments and the ones that aren 't I have a couple of names to run by her to make sure I'm going in the right
           direction.

           Here's my agenda:

           Regents (vacancy and student regent)
           Aviation
           Nursing
           Community Service
           Children's Trust
           Safety Advisory

           Thanks,

           Ivy Frye
