                   Mike N: can you help on this one? I have a house full of Chamber of Comm. people downstairs
                   so can't get to this one for a bit...

                  I believe (though we worded it within the sanctuary) that your statement below applied to opening the
                  state area up at all to hunting because there are other opportunities elsewhere. The lands around the
                  sanctuary are frequented by the same bears. Is that your view?
                  Thanks,

                  Governor,

                  Just for clarification . What about the state land used by bears near the sanctuary ? If nothing changes,
                  land near the sanctuary will be open to hunting July 1st. Folks at Environment and Energy Publishing are
                  inquiring.

                  Thanks
                  Sharon

                  I am a hunter and firmly support Alaska 's great hunting opportunities.

                   However, I oppose hunting in the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary . It is too close to the McNeil
                   River Falls and the popular viewing area.

                  That area is a gem . The sanctuary is one of Alaska 's treasures.

                  People come to Alaska from around the world to see our bears and, in this case , I do believe there
                  are plenty of other opportunities to hunt bears without hunting so close to Alaska's gem.
