              Governor Palin Signs     `Safe Haven' Bill Into Law

             Bill allows parents to surrender newborns without prosecution




              February 11, 2008, Juneau, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin signed House Bill 29 into law
              today.  The "Safe Haven for Infants Act" passed the State House in May and passed the
              Senate on January 19.

             The bill allows a parent to safely surrender a newborn child without the threat of
             prosecution, as long as there is no evidence the infant has been physically injured.

             Without penalty, a parent may leave the infant in the physical custody of a peace officer,
             physician or hospital employee, or a volunteer or employee of a fire station or emergency
             medical service.

             "All children deserve to begin their lives in a loving, protective family," Governor Palin
             said .  "When that fails, it is our job as a state to make sure that children are
             protected.   I thank the bill' s sponsor , Representative Gabrielle.LeDoux, for her hard work
             and persistence in bringing this bill forward."

             Under HB 29, if a parent wishes to relinquish his or her parental rights and release the
             infant for adoption, the person receiving the infant must contact the Department of Health
             and Social Service.

             The Department of Health and Social Services will begin educating emergency responders and
             the public about the law and how an infant'may be safely surrendered.

             "Unfortunately , abandonment of infants has occurred in Alaska ," HSS Commissioner Karleen
             Jackson said .  " It is our hope that the passage of the ` Safe Haven ' act has ended that
