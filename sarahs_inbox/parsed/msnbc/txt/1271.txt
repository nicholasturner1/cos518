Hello Governor! I was born here in Alaska (Homer) and am currently residing in Anchorage. I'm a
local author who recently released my first book. It's an autobiography (in first person) that deals with
Aspergers / Autism and Turner Syndrome.

It mentions allot of topics relevant today. I'm proud of my home state ... I recently found out about
your pregnancy and wish you the best with that. I know that with Alaska being known for the high
crime rates and abuse against women, it's refreshing to have a female Governor taking the reins.



Cheers!
