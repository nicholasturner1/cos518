               Subject: More Budget Analysis
              We are continuing to refine the analysis of the budgets - attached is a two-page workbook - the first tab
              is basically what I sent this morning with minor tweaks in the FY08 Governor Column and the second tab
              is a comparison of the FY08 starting point to the FY09 Governor's Amended budget and the FY08 starting
              point to the FY09 Legislature's budget - I was trying to get to Rep. Chenault's statement about a 23%
              increase. You can get there if you back the supplemental amount out of our December starting point.

               However, we did not include tax credits in our spending numbers - so, you will see on the bottom of page
               2, a GF comparison without tax credits. We had a 4% overall GF increase in December and ended up
               with a 7. 2% increase - largely due to the adjustments for the bargaining unit agreements , and a couple of
               large capital requests , $12.5 million for erosion and $8 million for the bullet line.

               I hope this is helpful! KJR
