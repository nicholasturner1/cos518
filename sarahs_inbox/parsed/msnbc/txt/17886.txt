        I've attached a note from our friend at Fred Meyer. This is in response to

        my phone call that you needed to be in Anch/Petersburg and couldn't attend

        his event.     Did he ask permission from you to put you in his ad?

        In our grand opening add for next week we did advertise that Sarah would be

        at the store to join in on the cake cutting event. If plans do change we

        would really like to have her here.



        Thank you,
