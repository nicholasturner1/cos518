            Wagoner Calls for Hayes Impeachment



            Resolution Directs House to Begin Trial




            JUNEAU-Sen . Tom Wagoner , R-Kenai, will introduce a resolution Monday

            directing the State House to begin an impeachment trial to remove indicted

            University of Alaska Regent James C. Hayes.




            "I thought long and hard before I decided to go through with the resolution

            to impeach Regent Hayes .          I have met the gentleman, I have served with him on

            the postsecondary commission ,          I like him as a person , but when the

            university is put in the position that they have a regent who has been

            indicted by the federal government ,          I think that casts a pall over the whole

            Board of Regents and the university administration ," Sen. Wagoner said.

                                                                    2




                                                                                                               PRA_GSP01_0000342

             The resolution refers the matter to the House of Representatives for a trial

             on impeachment for the removal of Mr . Hayes from the University of Alaska

             Board of Regents.




             The resolution states that the Senate finds by clear and convincing evidence

             that Mr . Hayes has committed an impeachable offense by his unauthorized use

             of the University of Alaska Seal to secure funding for his personal benefit

             and use ,   and by being unable or unwilling to carry out his duties to the

            University of Alaska as demonstrated by his past and continuing absences

             from the meetings of the Board of Regents.




            A federal grand jury in Anchorage has indicted Mr. Hayes on multiple counts

            of theft ,   conspiracy and money laundering ,     charging that Mr . Hayes and his

            wife improperly diverted $ 825,000 from federal grants that were supposed to

            go to LOVE Social Services Center.




            Hayes ' 8-year appointment to the Board of Regents expires in 2011, and he

            has stated he intends to serve out his term.




            "I think the right thing for him to do would be step down . if he isn't

            willing to do that ,      then I am willing to go the last step we have, and

            that's an impeachment resolution and start the impeachment process, because

            nobody should be allowed to sit in a seat when they have this much
