            Was so happy to wake up to the wonderful news that Lydia Green is RETIRING. She
            SHOULD!!!!




            Keep up the good work Governor Palin.




            We live on a limited income and are hoping and praying that your plan for issueing cards
     3      to be used for gasoline passes . It would help a lot of Alaskans.




            KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK - WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR OUR BEAUTIFUL
            STATE OF ALASKA!!!!!
