            Fairbanks Newsminer is mischaracterizing our position and statements on

            earmarks - today ' s editorial is so off base that we need to submit a

            letter to the ed, or an op - ed ,   along the lines of our Carl Marrs

            response . None of us have said earmarks are what these editors claim

            we've suggested.



            John- would you rewrite the Marrs response for the Newsminer?



            Here we're trying to assist and " obey " Young and Stevens re :        laying off

            earmark requests     ( for their own good too ), and they're letting our

            efforts bite us in the butt . I spoke with Lisa about this yest at the

            Iditarod start ,    thanked her for her understanding of where we are on

            this , and had a good conversation with her saying she knows we're trying

            to do the right thing on this . We'll have lunch in two weeks when she's

            back up.
