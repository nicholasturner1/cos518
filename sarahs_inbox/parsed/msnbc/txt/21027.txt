          Karen and I have expressed that even if approved, we will not be able to do everything at
          once.     Shortly after the cabinet meeting, Karen's staff sent out an email to all
          commissioners requesting that they list their absolute must haves, prioritize those and
          show how those priorities can be phased in over 3 to 5 years. Walt was absent but his
          staff does have the instructions and should be working to meet our Oct 8 deadline to hear
          back from the agencies.         We will have to prioritize his items along with everyone else.
