Subject :               Rural Affairs Advisor


Tibs: currently there are a lot of rural "hot" issues, so let's have cabinet suggest names for rural
affairs advisor also - we can talk about all this at tomorrow's cabinet mtg.



Sen Dyson had some suggestions also - for that position.



We should hustle on finding the right person.
