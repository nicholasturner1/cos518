          Did leg liason office talk to him then conclude he has all the info he's be requesting, so
          i should call him? I just dont want to make cold calls that will tick off stedman and
          others if they're desiring info that isnt at my fingertips.



         Let me know if they say this is a call i should make

         Governor - Senator Bert Stedman called this afternoon. He would like a call back from you
         today regarding The Bridge.  He can be reached at 747-8393. Mike talked with him earlier
         today and explained it to him. Thanks, Janice
