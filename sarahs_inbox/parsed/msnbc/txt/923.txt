MESSAGE:

Sarah,

Just wanted you to know I have been following the amazing job you have been doing for the state of
Alaska and those of us who live here.

It has been refreshing to have a "Momma Bear" at the helm, guarding our resources with energy and
integrity.

And congratulations on your baby. We are all tickled to hear your news, and think you should have a
contest for a name.

We have already thrown around Juneau and Veto.

Good Luck, and thanks for being such a terrific example for all of those you represent.

Paula Pettijohn
