            Thanks so much! You never know, as we've been surprised so often before, we may be asked
            to say a few words... so thanks very much for preparing these remarks Kate. You're
            sincerely appreciated. (I appreciate ALL of you for lining out all of these events!)

            in case , here are some speaking points for you. i will make sure you get a printed copy
            of these before the event .  Thanks!



            Kate




            * I am so proud of the Soldiers of Bravo Company, 297th Support Battallion




            * You have shown incredible courage in the face of the enemy... during the most dangerous
            deployment of the Alaska Army National Guard

                                                                   1




                                                                                                                 PRA_GSP01_0016659

            * You have made a strong impact on the security of the area and provided hope           for local
            Iraqis in the fashion only Alaskans can display




            * The numbers are impressive : 4 Bronze Stars for Valor, 21 Bronze Stars for Service, 2
            Army Commendation Medals for Valor, 62 Army Commendation Medals for Service , 6 Purple
            Hearts, and 79 Army Achievement Medals for Service




            * To rack up such an impressive resume shows there is much more that took place that has
            not been formally recognized to achieve such recognition ... that is what makes Alaskans
            even more proud of you.




            * You worked as a team, you are professionals , and you have made us proud.




            * Thank you for all that you have done, and for the sacrifices you and your families have
            made in order to secure our freedom and safety.




            * Welcome home Soldiers of Bravo Company , 297th Support Battallion .... God Bless you!
