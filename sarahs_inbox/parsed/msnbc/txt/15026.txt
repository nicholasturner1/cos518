           I'll mostly just listen and make sure she is hanging with us. No need for action at this
           time.

           Governor,




           Is there anything you need from me regarding this potential meeting? My instinct is to
           just let her share her feelings and opinions regarding adding the bills to a special
           session.  Her desire is limited to the Eagle Forum and doesn't include all the issues and
           concerns you must take into consideration when making such a determination.

            When deb joslin wrote the email she said she only needed 10 minutes for our meeting
            tomorrow, correct? And I'll let Kelly G know of this mtg be she's asking good question
            about the abortion issues as they relate to leggies who are (or more likely are NOT)
            asking us to do what Lyda has requested with expanding the sp sess call.

            I'll attend the Spartan exercise May 16.



             I'll do press conf for 1:30 print signing May 9 (can it be moved to 1:00 instead?), and
            I'll assume it's over in time for me to zip over to quick ceremony at 2:30 for police
            memorial.

           Governor - Your calendar shows the Speech for the Alaskan Police Memorial Ceremony in ANC.
             This was an invitation that we received from Comm. Schmidt and Comm. Monegan. They are
           requesting Governor or a designee to attend and give brief remarks during the memorial
           ceremony to honor the fallen law enforcement officers and the ones they have left behind.



           Location: Anchorage Memorial Statue (in front of the State Crime Lab)

           Date/Time:    Friday, 05.09.08 - 2:30 p.m.



           This time would coincide with the end of the 50th Anniversary Celebration - Press
           Conference - Print Signing at the ANC - Museum. May we just decline this request?



           The Lt. Governor's office is asking as the Lt. Governor feels either the Governor or the
           Lt. Governor should be present for event listed below:



           4/25th Dedication for Spartan Memorial - 4th Brigade Combat Team.

           Location:    Fort Richardson

           Date/Time:    Friday,    05.16.08 - 10:00 a.m.



           You previously commented "can do if short." Event approx. 1 hour in duration.



           The whole 4-25 BDE of 3800 paratroopers will be in attendance, we have approximately 200
           family members of soldiers killed in Iraq attending, the Elmendorf Wing Commander is
           attending, our CG MG Layfield will be present, plus spouses and other local military
           members will also attend. I would say grand total in attendance will be about 5000.



           The Governor is not expected to do anything but show up and if she wishes, she can meet
           and greet some of the family members of our fallen soldiers. She will not be required to
           speak or do anything formal.



          The event starts 16 May at 1000hrs, but we plan to have everyone seated and ready for the
          ceremony by 0945. The event will end at 1100hrs.



          Thank you, Janice
