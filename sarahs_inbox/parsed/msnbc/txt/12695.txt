           Dear Honorable Governor Palin,




           I truly feel that Sen McCain would be making the BEST choice               by asking you to be his
           running mate in the 2008 Election.




           We need to have a young dynamic female on the ticket with a great record. The Republican
           Party has to do this to even compete against the Dems in 2008.

           You also seem to have a good family too!



           I sure hope that the party does NOT select a older Republican like Christ, because it will
           not help in the battle against Hillary and Barrack . Our party will guarantee a loss in
           2008 if they do.



           God Bless,

           Gary Balser

           Strong Republican in Ohio
