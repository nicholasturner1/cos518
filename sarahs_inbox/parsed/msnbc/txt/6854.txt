             Subject: Chris Hayes

           Chris Hayes serves on the Human Rights Commission. This is a board where cause is needed for removal.
           There is a Human Rights Commission meeting tomorrow. The chair contacted me today to say that Chris'
           attendance is infrequent. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

           We have already removed her from AWIB b/c members serve at governor's pleasure.

           Thanks,

           Ivy Frye
