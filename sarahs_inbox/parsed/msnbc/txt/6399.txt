        I haven't heard back from Denby or Campbell on my request to extend hunting season for AK
        troops at war. (I wrote the email Sunday)



        Mike - would u follow up w/them? I hate to bug and remind people - that's why any
        acknowledgement of my "sent" emails is so appreciated, I at least know they recvd the
        message . Pls let them know of my directive on that, and they can re-read Sunday's email if
        they need more info on it. Thanks
