              MESSAGE:
              Thank you for being color blind! I am weary of race status being descisive
              criteria for many aspects of our lives. I thought we fought for civil rights in
              the 60's for ALL people? It seems that some still want special treatment,
              recognition, position, and compensation by virtue of race!  Will it never end?

              Thanks so much for doing a great job. I appreciate your strength and diplomacy in
              taking a stand. It is refreshing to have a leader that will stand up and say it
              straight and not double talk.

              I hope you are enjoying your life as well. Don't let the stresses of your job wear
              you down.  Know that there are many folks that support and encourage you.

              Regards,
              Bill Thompson
