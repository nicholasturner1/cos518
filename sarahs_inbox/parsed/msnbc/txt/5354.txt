                 I've emailed Katz. We're on a conference call at this point, but should have an answer later.

                 let's ask Katz where these projects are re: future Fed. funding potential.
                 pls email him and ask

                   We can answer these after the Carrigan show, but Bill Yardley has some questions
                   for you about the Knik and Gravina bridges. Doing a short story follow after
                   Murkowski re: the bridges to nowhere.

                   Do you regard either as priorites?

                   Do you support these two?

                   If you don't, what happens to the bridges? If you do, how do you go to bat for the
                   money?

                   I did tell him that your capital budget was stripped to that which is supported by
                   matching federal dollars. However, what was left is closer to $100m and certainly
                   wouldn't cover the bridges. I mentioned that you want to build the capital budget
                   with the Legislature. He would like specifics.

                   I would be happy to call him back - or you can . With the NYT, it always looks good
                   to have more mentions of your name . Just in case , his number is 206 -420-1217.

                   Thanks,
