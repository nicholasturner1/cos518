            Governor - I was interviewed by Dave Donaldson, Anne Sutton, Bill

            McAllister, Stephen M., Kristina?? On the second floor about the capital

            budget - told them there are significant items missing that are basic

            health, safety, deferred maintenance projects gave them some examples

            like water & sewer projects, transportation, etc... told them the big
                                                                1

            differences really are the number of district projects added under DCCED

            grants - approximately $300 million - versus state priorities. Clearly

            there has to be a responsible budget by the end and that we will

            continue to work toward that.



            They also asked about when you will make a decision on supplemental -

            told them we still have a few more meetings with legislators - that I

            didn't think we would be able to do much before Thursday -

           We need to do it sooner. Senate just had their press avail and we can't

            let their issues go unanswered for another two days. Mike and I are

           working on it.

             Governor-



             I would like to pitch the idea of a press availability on Thursday. We

             could cover budget items as well as CON.

             Great work last night that resulted in that very, very valuable list

             that Mike compiled re: important priorities that Stedman and leadership

             screwed over and replaced with much less important earmarks. I am ready

             to talk to reporters about this- it's absolutely unacceptable and

             outrageous and Alaskans NEED to know what's going on here so they can

             pressure their elected officials to do the right thing for our state.
