           Subject: URGENT - can you do a phoner with Channel 2 tonight for tomorrow?
           Sorry to bother you Governor:

           I know you are heading out of town soon . Bill McAllister wanted to interview you tomorrow
           regarding a possible run for the U.S. Senate or House . I explained that you had "family
           time" scheduled. I told him that you told the New York Times today that you love being
           Governor of Alaska and you have a lot on your plate. He was wondering if you could do a
           phoner at 6:45 tonight for the story tomorrow. Please let me know.

           Thanks!
