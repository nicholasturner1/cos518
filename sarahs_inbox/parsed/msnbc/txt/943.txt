Am I allowed to use this to be personal? Congratulations on the upcoming baby! Todd is a stallion
and you are still amazing. I am Kellie-- I have nine kids and we helped on your campaign. "Big
families rule"-- literally!



I am in college and so often people ask how I do it. I get sick of justifying returning to college with
children still at home. Now I can roll my eyes and say, "The governor just had her fifth baby! Of
course I am finishing my degrees! It's no big deal."




Alaska Girls kick ass! There are no limits!
