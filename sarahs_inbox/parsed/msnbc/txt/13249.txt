           Wow! That's a beautiful picture!!! I'm going to ask Jason/Andy if this one would work-for

                 Congradulations! Welcome baby Trig Paxson Van Palin. Heres to pure love. What a precious
                 gift from God you are, and Lucky tool You have two wonderful parents, and awesome siblings!
                 I've always liked your mom shes, "Real", down to earth. I used to talk to your mom every
                 day when I worked at the "Family FitnI worked in the day care area where I watched your
                 sister Willow. I would talk to your mom about nothing, and shes always made me feel like I
                 was talking about something. Never talked about politics thou.

                  Trig I created this Mattel Drowsy Doll to look like your mom might have looked like when
                she was a little girl, Any way I was wondering if your mom might sign her for me? I think
                she would be quite pleased with the detail. Any way welcome to the world Love Always,
                Kathy Furbush Wasilla, Alaska
