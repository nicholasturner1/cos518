          You're a trooper Meg! I still can not believe you were on that CNN shoot. Go take a nap!
          Eric, too. Really, you're going to need massive energy for the big one coming up!



          Anyway - Walt called, forest fire in Petersville is taxing our local guys - I may stop by
          our local dept and thank the guys for all their efforts, Walt thought that's a good idea -
          we may be bringing in Anchorage guys to help. KTUU was headed out there after their stop
          here this morning.



          I won't need assistance to do any stop-by, just wanted to let you know.
