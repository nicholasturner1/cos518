             With Pat's family activities , it looks like we need this to be either Sunday morning or
             Monday morning . Pick a time and let me know .  We will coordinate the necessary logistics.

             Hope all is well - did PA have compelling and legally sound reasons to hear them out?

             Boss,



              We are coming up on another big decision on the PA request for reconsideration. The
             commissioners are leaning in one direction, but would like to talk to you this weekend.
             They are headed to DC Tuesday and Pat is traveling Monday, so they are requesting some of
             your time on Saturday or Sunday to have a teleconference. Is that something that can work
             for you? If so, is there anybody besides myself, Tibbles, and Marty that you want
             involved? Remember that we had the Lt Gov involved last time.



              Joe
