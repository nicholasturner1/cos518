                I will also check with Mike Nizich . When an incident arises , he is the first person to receive a call from Emergency
                Management. I know that he was in frequent contact and was provided updates . He passed those along to me
                and Meg here at the office and we worked on the short statement . When I talked to him last night , I was under
                the impression that you were on his call list. I will make sure that we do a better job at trying every number and
                even email to make contact with you.

                Mike

                Mike - would you let McHugh Pierre know that someone from Homeland Security/Emergency
                Management needs to call me and inform me on things like this. It was Todd who called to ask if I'd
                heard about the tsunami warnings, so I called around to get information. Thankfully Meg handled media
                well.

                Tell McHugh or whomever that I insist on being informed during any situation where the public would
                feel any person could be in danger during a potentially disasterous occurance.

                Thank you

                  Just spoke to the Governor. Here you go.

                  Governor Palin:

                  My thoughts and prayers are with all our coastal communities right now. We have the state's
                  emergency management team watching, monitoring and providing updates to local officials in
                  those communities.

                  Alaska stands by to offer assistance, if need be.
