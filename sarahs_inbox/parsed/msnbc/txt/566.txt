  Dear Governor and First Gentleman: Thank you so much for the opportunity to work with you in your new
  and bright administration. I am looking forward to the new challenges and learning ahead of me. I hope
  you and your family have a wonderful and restful summer and I wish you all the best for the next four
  years. I am only a phone call away if I can be of any assistance whatsoever to you. Kari
