            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor Palin,



            Congratulations on the birth of your son Trig. I just wanted to let you know that my
            wife, Colleen, and I had our fifth child just three years ago. Aidan was born on April
            19, 2005 and, like your son, he has Downs Syndrome. I cannot tell you in words the joy
            that he has brought to our family. His smile and laughter brings us sunshine every day.
            God has truly blessed us. I already know from reading your comments that you and your
            husband will be the prefect parents for Trig.



            Congratulations Again,

            Bob Clegg
