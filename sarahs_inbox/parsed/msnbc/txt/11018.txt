              I'm on plane finally - for bethel. Hopefully blackberry works up there. (Often when I'm on
              rural trips interesting things happen back in Anchorage.)

              This would show that our Governor is keenly interested in a whole district being properly
              represented.  it was wrong that district "O" wasn't represented for the Special in Oct.
