             ps: One other thing occurred to me. Since you will be in New York, you might want
             to consider making the rounds of some of the media outlets.

             We have talked about ways to disseminate the messages that Alaska is under new
             management and that we are ready and willing to provide domestically produced oil
             and gas to the nation. New York is the headquarters of most of the major media,
             and I think that there's a curiosity about Alaska and you as the new Governor.

               I can't speak to the issues you mentioned, but there's not much happening in DC
               that week. Putting Congress aside, there is little pending at the
               Gubernatorial/ Secretarial level in the various federal agencies.

                Until we see the pattern of AGIA applications, I don't think that there's much to
                tell the agencies with pipeline interests. Even FERC is in a wait and see mode.

                   Thanks. I do want to capitalize on my East Coast trip that week though. There
                   may be other options hopefully.

                   I understand that you might want my opinion on the advisability = of coming
                   to DC on October 9th to meet with one or more members of the =
                   Congressional Delegation.

                   I have a simple response which has nothing to do with policy or = strategy.
                   The congress will not be in session during the week of = October 8th, which is
                   the Columbus day recess, and none of the delegation = is expected to be here.
