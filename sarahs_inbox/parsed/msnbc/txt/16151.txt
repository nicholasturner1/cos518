            Britta,



            Heard you're back! We're excited for you to join the team. If you have everything squared
            away and are able to, we'd like you to start Monday. Why don't you come in at 8:30 am and
            then we can work up a schedule from there. Also, Janice and Hannah will come to Anchorage
            (from Juneau) to help train on the scheduling aspect, probably Tuesday.



            Let me know if you have any questions or if you need anything.



            Look forward to seeing you.



            Thanks,

            Kris
