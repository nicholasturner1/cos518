           Thanks, Kris.     If things go further downhill, I'll certainly pass it off.             Privileged or Pers^

           Kate,




           I'm so sorry. I will keep your         and you and your family, in my prayers. Can someone
           else take over the speech? Please let me know if there is anything I can do.


     i
           Kris

                                      I will continue working on this speech, but may be getting it
           out for review tomorrow morning, as opposed to this evening, due to recent events.



           I still anticipate getting the speech to the Gov by tommorrow evening.




           Thank you,




           Kate
