                 MESSAGE:
                 V.P. position? I am supporting Rudy for'08.1 would like to see you as
                 his running mate...or in conjunction with any one of the alternative
                 Presidential candidates who survives the primary.

                 AS a contributor to Rudy' s campaign ..albeit a 'small contributor as of
                 yet... I am going to email him with my recommendation for Governor Palin
                 to be a potential candidate for V.P.

                 The republicans must win this election. And based on my research, you
                 would be a great asset to the presidential campaign.

                 Thanks for your time,
                 Dwayne
