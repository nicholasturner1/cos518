            Governor,



            Want to make sure I didn't miss a green-light email on the rest these open board spots
            with recommendations below.  I have made contact with Wes Keller & Dyson's office and Wes
            in particular has some thoughts on the DV task force. Dan Jarrell also called
            recommending Barbara or Mike Curtis for the open clergy spot on the Suicide Prevention
            Council which I have to research out more.



            The spots below are:

            North Pacific Research Board

            Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery

            Commission on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault

            Suicide Prevention Council

            Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee

            Seismic Hazards Safety Commission

            Governor,



            On our discussion yesterday I spoke with Dorothy Larson of DLG. It just isn't going to
            work out for her to catch the next DV Task Force meetings so I'm back to the well talking
            with Paulette Schuerch, Tara, and others about candidates.



            The rest below are still good for your approval.



            Thanks!



            F

           Oh ves ..... Ker mentioned him as well... and he MIGHT be a good candidate for the       Privileged on
           Privile ed oard that we have not been able to fill.



            Kerm feels that a Chuck Heath should be your official unpaid advisor for all statewide
            game issues.

            Before I forget- my former employee Don Moore (also former mat su boro manager) will serve
            for us. He's so smart- he'd be perfect at anything tough.
