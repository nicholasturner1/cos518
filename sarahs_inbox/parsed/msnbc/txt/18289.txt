         Dear Ms . Courtney:




        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.




        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

         Dear Governor:




        Thank you ever so much for cutting the budget via the veto pen. It is high time someone
        recognized the government is not Santa Claus. I applaud your actions and will tell my
        legislators so.



        With respect and gratitude,

        Laurie B. Courtney
