             MESSAGE-

             I strongly urge the Gov. to stick to her guns and give her state of the state at 6PM. The
             legislature has for decades been arrogant and has ignored the will of the people and what
             has been good for Alaska. The level of corruption is high and identified clearly. It is
             way past time that the Legislature began to act like polite people and to recognize that
             they are not imperial. I hope like h..l that the Gov. gives her speech at 6PM...and so
             does my wife who is CEO of the Alaska Municpal League. (She likely will say nothing so as
             not to offend)
