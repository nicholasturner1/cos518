              Is there anything more feminine. I don't think I'd ever wear this.

               You requested more info regarding a 'trapper style '      fur hat .   This style

               has several features:

                      (a) an insulated crown or body,

                      (b) your selection of materials on the crown (Governor Palin has

               specified black leather),

                      (c) a-fur panel on the front, and

                      ( d) fur-lined flaps on the side.



               The attached files contain photos of two different hats .        They can be

               worn several different ways:

                      (a)   flaps down over your ears when it is cold,

                      (b)   flaps tied back when it is cool, or

                      (c)   flaps tied up when it is warm & you want to look 'cool.'




                                                               2
