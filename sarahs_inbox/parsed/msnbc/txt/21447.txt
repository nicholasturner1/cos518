                     Subject: Briefing paper regarding Alexander Creek

                   Alexander Creek empties into the Susitna River just a few miles from Cook Inlet. The village
                   on that creek is located just over 27 miles northwest of Anchorage. The original village
       J
                   population was decimated by disease and the survivors migrated to Tyonek in the 1920s. By
                   1939, Native families began to reoccupy the original village site.

                   Following the enactment of ANCSA, which required 25 residents to make a village eligible for
                   selection status, the BIA determined there were 37 Natives properly enrolled to the village.
                   However, most of the land that would have been available to the village for selection was
                   already conveyed to the State and the Mat-Su Borough. Protests ensued and an adjudication
                   process began. The ANCSA Appeal Board determined that there were only 22 village
                   residents - three short of the required 25. Alexander Creek appealed to the district court,
                   which in 1975 ordered the village reinstated. Appeals and litigation continued, but despite
                   victories in the district and appellate courts, the village, CIRI, and the US Government signed
                   an agreement whereby Alexander Creek dropped its claim to be a village in exchange for
                   group status. This meant the village would receive significantly less acreage.

                   As the next generation of leaders grew into adulthood, including Stephanie Thompson, they
                   realized the significance of the court victories won by the village and what should have been
                   done by their predecessors. As a result, they have sought and won the support of CIRI,.AFN,
                   and the Mat-Su Borough in pursuit of congressional legislation to re-open ANCSA to
                   recognize Alexander Creek.

               Earlier this year, as in years' past, Congressman Young introduced legislation to effectuate
               Alexander Creek's goals. Recently, he has made efforts to secure a hearing in the House
               Resources Committee. He has not, however, asked for State support or testimony. Privileged
