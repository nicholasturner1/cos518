                  For some reason I have not been able to send email to your yahoo account . I tried to send this three
                  times and it bounced back every time. Please let me know if this comes through your alaska.gov
                  account. Thanks.

                  Mike

                  I am resending this. The last one bounced back with an error.

                 I have attached a copy of my first run at the State of the State . I wanted to get you something for the
                 2008 speech before the end of 2007 . Anyway , let me know if you think it is on the right track.

                 I thought I would take a break from it today and read it over fresh tomorrow . On Wednesday , I thought I
                 would have a small group made up of special assistants and Larry Persily help me fact check and test
                 sensitivity and direction. There are some items in the draft that have not been made public yet. Two
                 examples are Habitat and Health Care reform measures so I will be careful not to send it out.

                 Last year' s speech was 4300 words and seemed a bit long. I tried to keep it shorter this time. This draft
                 is now 3800 words , hopefully close to the 35 minute target I was shooting for.

                 Happy New Year!

                 Mike
