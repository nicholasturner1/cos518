             Hi Marc:

             Your fall colors photo that ran yesterday is the prettiest autumn picture I've ever seen.

             We're ordering a copy for the Anchorage office.

             You are talented - your talent captured that most beautiful scene.

             Thank youl

             Sarah Palin
