          Lynne and Mike: this is the issue that has erupted in controversy - I have not been in the
          loop until hearing the rage of some expressed on talk radio about this issue this week.



          It is my position that the Homeschool organization should be allowed allowed adequate time
          to speak at the public board meeting. Please work with Ms.Cox to allow that. Please let me
          know how the parents desiring their voices be heard will be notified that they will be
          allowed adequate time to speak at the meeting. Thank you.

         Board of Alaska Home Educators Alliance:




         The Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development is going to have a one hour work
         session on September 20th on statewide correspondence schools.    It is an information
         session for the board with presentations by several State Department of Education
         personnel, and an opportunity for Board members to ask questions and to discuss.       It is
         not the intent of the Board to hammer out any modification or eradication of regulations
         regarding statewide correspondence.   Therefore, we are not asking for any participation
         by members of the pubic.




         The Board is on a tight agenda , and we shall be sticking to the time allotments as closely
         as possible .  There are any number of issues before the Board, and each one deserves full
         time and consideration.




        There will be time to       testify at the beginning     of the meeting as always .   Testimony from
        interested parties on       any agenda or non - agenda   item is encouraged ;   however , again time
        will be an issue . It       would be helpful if your     organization would select two or three
        people to testify who       would represent the home     school community.




        Thank you.




        Esther J. Cox
