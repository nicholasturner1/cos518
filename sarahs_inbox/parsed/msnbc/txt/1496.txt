Hi Todd,



Here's your flight information:

Conf. Code: PUPUFA

Flt. 74


                                                       1                          ROSTON 02754




Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
Dep. 6:40pm.

Arr. 8:32pm.

Seat: 7B



When you check in, see if they can change your seat for you. There were only middle and exit rows
left when I made reservations.



Sharon Busch (DOL) needs to know your weight for the helicopter mine tours.



Anything in particular that you'd like for dinner, lunch or stocked in the fridge?



Thanks,

Erika
