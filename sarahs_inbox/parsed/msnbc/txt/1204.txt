MESSAGE:

On behalf of the Down Syndrome Association of Central Texas, congratulations on the birth of your
son Trig.



 Our 4-year old daughter Hannah has Down syndrome. I can say with confidence that my husband
 and I are better people because she's a part of our lives. Her sisters are much more compassionate,
kind and loving than their peers, and much more accepting of all children. She has added so much
joy, happiness, and love to our lives!



Again, congratulations!



Lori Tullos Barta, J.D.

President
