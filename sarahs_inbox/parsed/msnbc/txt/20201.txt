               Mike:
               It looks like the House is standing its ground for now (at least in House Finance) against the Senate with a
               $1,200 rebate, suspending the motor fuel tax, adding some funds to LIHEAP , etc. Their CS does not
               adopt many of the provisions the Senate wants.
