             Subject: NEA Request for Mansion Recpetion on April 13

           Today I received a request from NEA (Bill Bjork ) to hold a reception in the Governor's honor at the Governor's
           Mansion on April 13 (Friday). I called Mr. Bjork to let him know that the Governor would not be in Juneau, she's
           been scheduled for another event for some time , and therefore would not be available to attend this reception (or
           host it?) whatever the case. Karl.
