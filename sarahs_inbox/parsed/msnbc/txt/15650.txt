           I will find out who from the Board, DNR, etc attended. But I just found out from Kristan
           - the one who has advocated and worked her butt off on this - that she knew nothing about
           it.

           Very,very odd. And disappointing. I hope they at least invited Kristan and Joey and
           others! Wonder if Lyda had anything to do w this. -----Original Message----- From: Kris

           No, we did not receive an invitation and I'm calling Kyle this morning. He and I spoke a
           few weeks back and he said they weren't ready yet for a grand opening celebration but that
           he'd coordinate with me on your schedule once they were. I have not heard anything back
           from him since that conversation. This is unbelievable. Yesterday, I rec'd an email from
           Dick Lefebrve that Senator Stevens was stopping by the new creamery and that was it,
           nothing more than that. I'll go thru old emails from him or anyone else to make sure I
           didn't miss anything, but am pretty darn certain I did not. So, in other words, everyone
           that had NOTHING to do with this were there and those that BUSTED THEIR BUTT weren't even
           invited.  I'm calling Kyle. --- On Sat, 5/31/08, gov.palin@yahoo.com <gov.palin@yahoo.com>

           Date: Saturday, May 31, 2008, 8:53 AM Kris- if you read the article this morning you'll
           see something's fishy about it be the creamery claims it's success is due to Lyda's
           support- and everyone under the sun was there at the grand opening incl Stevens, Young,
           local elected officials, etc. Are we sure we didn't get any invitation to attend? -----
