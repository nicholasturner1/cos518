         Dear Ms. Knowles:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        THANK YOU for not being afraid to veto items in the budget ;          I'm sure that you're

        not the most popular person at the moment in many a legislator ' s eyes but I want

        you to know seeing fiscal restraint in state government is wonderful and I

        appreciate what      you've done and wholeheartedly support you.



        I'm so pleased that you're Alaska's governor and have kept your promise to have

        open, transparent leadership and that you're not one to follow a pre-set way of

        doing things because the Republican party says it should be a certain way. Truly

        acting in the best interest of Alaska ' s citizens is something I thought many

        politicians lost stomach for long ago.



        THANK YOU for restoring my faith in government , bit by bit.



        Sincerely,

        Kathryn Knowles
