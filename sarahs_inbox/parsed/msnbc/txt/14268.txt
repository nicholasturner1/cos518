           Just a note to congratulate you on the birth of sweet, baby Trig. God bless your family.
           How blessed little Trig is to be born into a very special family. You are doing a
           wonderful job and admire you so much Sarah. Your dad was my 7th grade science teacher here
           in Sandpoint. You have much strength from your family roots and it shows. Blessings to
           all!
