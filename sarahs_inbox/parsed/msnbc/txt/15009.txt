            Thank you- pls consider this in reponse to Forgey, Sharon. And remember he's going to
            write something incorrect if his track record is to be followed.

             Subject: FW: Scanned from IM653OExec [E-Mail_Recipients].                   Pat Forgey story on

              pay raise bill




             Governor:




             MTAB, DOT and I have had many problems with Pat Forgey's creative spin

             in writing news articles for the Empire. He writes first and does his

             research into the facts later. (If someone calls him on it).



             Attached is page 7 from the bill review on HB 417 prepared by the

             Department of Law.




             In discussing Section 19 of the bill, the review addresses the issue of

             pay raises for the group of "exempt" employees, such as commissioners.


                                                                    1




                                                                                                                      PRA GSP01_0017314
Searchable Analytics at www.CrivellaWest.com        Posted by msnbc.com, Mother Jones and Pro Publica. http://palinemail.msnbc.msn.com




            It clearly states:



             "This section does not, like sec. 20, entitle this group of employees

            to comparable adjustments. If exempt employees already have salaries

            that are comparable to, or higher than employees in the classified or

            partially exempt service, these exempt employees will not receive the

            adjustments. ...The administration plans to limit such exempt employees

            and officials including department heads, to their current salaries."

            Citing remarks on March 13, 2008, and April 9, 2008, in committee

            hearings by Commissioner Kreitzer.



            These bill reviews are public record once a bill has been signed.           If

            Forgey had asked for the bill review and spent some time reviewing it he

            could have put out an accurate story that noted the administration

            through Commissioner Kreitzer had consistently testified in committee

            hearings that it did not want to give certain exempt employees pay

            raises.
