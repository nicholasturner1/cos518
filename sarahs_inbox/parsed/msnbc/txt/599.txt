      Re:    Support for the Application of Polar Express Group, LLC and Sky King, Inc. for an
             Emergency Exemption (OST-2007-28795)

      Dear Secretary Peters:

      I am writing to support the emergency exemption application of Polar Express Group, LLC,
      ("Polar Express") and Sky King, Inc. ("Sky King") to engage in charter air transportation of
      persons and property between points within the State of Alaska (OST-2007-28795).

      We have urgently requested the services of Polar Express and Sky King due to immediate
      commercial need for private charter operations to support our private flight schedule between
      Anchorage and the North Slope region. Currently, we are unable to provide these flights because
      two of our aircraft are not available and supply is very limited.

      On July 31, 2007, one of our 737 aircraft incurred catastrophic engine failure immediately
      following departure from Prudhoe Bay-Deadhorse (SCC). At this time, this aircraft is expected
      to be out of service for an undetermined, but extended period of time, In addition, as of August 1,
      2007, another of our 737 aircraft was removed from service for heavy inspections for
      approximately six weeks. We are unable with are remaining 737 aircraft to meet the demands of
      our operations in the North Slope.

      Capacity for the proposed services is also inadequate. We have contacted seventeen air carriers
      in Alaska and the lower forty-eight states to supply the flights between Anchorage and
      Deadhorse. None of the contacted air carriers would agree to fulfill this request.

     As a result, we are facing delays and disruption in our operations, which could interfere with our
     overall gas and oil production in the North Slope Region. Moreover, a longer term need exists to
     meet future unforeseen circumstances. Undoubtedly if our remaining aircraft were to be
     removed from service, for whatever reason, we could face even greater challenges to our oil and
     natural gas production in Alaska. In order to resolve this urgent problem, and to address longer
     term contingencies, we are hoping to work with Polar Express and Sky King to meet our
     transportation needs.




                                                                                                    ROSTON 00718
