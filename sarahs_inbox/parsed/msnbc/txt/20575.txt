           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           I enjoyed meeting you, brief as it was at the Palmer fair. You mentioned that you were
           coming down to the Kenai Peninsula this weekend, and I would love give you a tour of the
           fair grounds here in Ninilchik and talk about ways we can help encourage our peninsula
           youth to continue raising Alaska Grown livestock and vegetables. This year 49 youth
           participated in the JML livestock auction, with total sales of over $70,000. That is
           amazing.  I live at the fair grounds so can be available any time. Please feel free to
           call me on my cell phone (907) 398-4468.




           I hope to see you.




                                                                1
