           I've never driven Trig anywhere without a new, approved carseat. I want to know who said
           otherwise- pls provide me that info now.

          Governor-

          1st - Have you read / approved the 2007 AST Annual Report to be made public?



          2nd - Via a soon-to-be -retiring legislator , we have received a complaint that had you
          driving with Trig not in an approved infant car seat; if so this would be awkward in many
          ways.



          Please know that I am trying to help...

          -Walt
