            Commissioner:

            Was thinking we could take the air out of psea's new ads by being proactive and sending a
            press release out before their ads come out. If they're going to say you and the governor
            don't understand the constitution we should say FIRST that the governor remains committed
            to constitutionally madated services and that psea like other unions are receiving bettwr
            contracts than they've seen in yrs. I'll finish looking over the constitution for you in
            the morning and get you some specifics for a press release if you decide to go that route.

            Ivy
