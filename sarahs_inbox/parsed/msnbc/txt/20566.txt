               Yes, but they want you to sign soon. They need the authorization in law to go ahead with the conflation of the
               PFD and the rebate.

               Subject Early PFD payment

               I see the article this morning about PFD payments going out on September 12. Do we have legislation back from the
               legislature to make that deadline? Have we told the press that we need the engrossed bill sent to us by a certain date in order
               to make that payment?
