              Thank you!



              Also- I want to mention in AGIA speech on Friday that TC's app provides a plan that may be
              better even that what Alaskans dared desired with mention of both in-state LNG line and
              Canadian line.

              We are working away in the war room down on 11 on the letters to each of the applicants.
              It will be very clear why they are being rejected-and that it has nothing to do with the
              comments of the Save Darfur folks or the sabre rattling out of DC.

               Thank you.



               Sure wish we could get our AGIA announcement out before anyone thinks we merely kowtowed
              to this pressure...

               The first attached page states that Rep. Lynn and Rep. Gara will introduce a Darfur
              Divestment Bill, "to restrict investments of Permanent Fund, other state funds."



               The next two pages are a press release , dated Jan . 3, from the Sudan Divestment Task
              Force, Washington D.C. and reads "AGIA Bidder Sinopec No Longer Eligible For Federal
              Contracts:  President Bush signs the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act. New law
              will authorize and endorse Rep. Lynn and Gara's Sudan divestment legislation and deny
              federal contracts to companies linked to the ongoing genocide in Darfur: including AGIA
              bidder Sinopec."
