                    IMve heard nothing from Joe or the writing team, and have no idea if drafts are in the works. So I am
                    apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I donat7rMt know if something with my name on it
                    will see the light of day otherwise.



                    Unfortunately, today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so this was a major rush
                    job. And I will not breach surface until tonight. But here are my thoughts, for what they are worth, based
                    upon your original draft.
