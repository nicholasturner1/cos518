                 I read your letter to Senator Reid. All I can say is GOD BLESS YOU, SARAH PALIN!!!!!! The American
                 people desperately need you in Washington as Vice President I know this is premature and speculative
                 but I don't care. My grandchildren's futures depend on us having a strong economy. Thank you so much
                 for making a stand . The people of Alaska are most fortunate to have you as their Governor.

                 With kind regards,
