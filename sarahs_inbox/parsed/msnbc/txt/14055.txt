                I returned Suzanne's (Rep Meyer's cos) phone call yesterday re: the op-ed . Below is her response.

                His office is saying they haven 't heard from the 3b floor re: a hearing request for this bill . I work on hearing
                requests all the time . I'm more than happy to draft the language and send to Russ to expedite the process -it will
                take 10 minutes tops, I know the bill backwards and forwards . I could even send it to Kris to send to Russ as to
                not step on toes.

                Ivy,
                Thanks for the phone call yesterday . We appreciate it The funny thing is, I went back and looked at hearing
                requests that I have received, and we haven 't even received a hearing request from the administration for HB
                106.

                Suzanne
