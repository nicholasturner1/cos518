                 He did the right thing that's for sure! Oh, great article in the ADN today by Cockerham re: oil and gas tax
                 legislation . NONE of the people that wrote in to comment on the article were in favor of the 22.5% tax rate. Goes
                 to show you and Mike Kelly and others are right on with the tax rate, prog, admin tools, etc. that bring AK its fair
                 share.

                 Today is going to be interesting . I was just talking to Ian (special asst in Rev.) and he said they aren 't allowing
                 anybody in the gallery, they're locking the doors, and no cell phones or pagers are allowed on the floor.

                 Pm paraphrasing of course, but he was very thoughtful and wise. H fin is still going strong tonight.
