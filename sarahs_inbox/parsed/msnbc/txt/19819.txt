               I'm still here, but we might need a few more decades at the rate Congress is going. Unfortunately, I
               don't have an heir who seems interested in public policy.

               P.S.
               Senator Stevens would say that he has been working on ANWR. every since 1960, when, as Solicitor of
               the Interior Department, he helped draft the order which established the Arctic National Wildlife
               Range. Hopefully, the voters will give the Senator a few more years to complete the mission.
