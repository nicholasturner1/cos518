           Governor:



           The publications that we are interested in want an exclusive, and we are

           pitching it now.



           We sent it to Roll Call at the beginning of the week and they declined

           to publish.



           We then sent to Washington Post and the editors are considering it, but

           we don't have a definite yet.



           Beth
