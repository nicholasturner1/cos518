  Todd,
  I looked at other flights should the Governor travel on Saturday instead. Same schedule; unless she took
  a red eye flight, the earliest arrival into DC is 9:46 p.m. A late evening/red eye flight would get her into
  D.C. in the afternoon. That would be an exhausting flight and day.

  If she were to remain w/a Friday departure... Janice, I saw a different flight on AK Airlines leaving at 8am
  (arriving at 9:46 pm) rather than the one she is currently on which leaves at 7am.

  I've seen a couple emails inquiring about weekend events, so not sure if she is still planning to go to DC.
  Please advise and Janice & I can do more work on this.
