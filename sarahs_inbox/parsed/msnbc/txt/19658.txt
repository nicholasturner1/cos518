               She wouldn't remember specifically be those were slammed days, so hopefully she does find out
               via her records. My calander is empty for those legislative months and I need to know why it is
               an empty record now. Would you ask Russ if he remembers who I visited hoffman with?

               Janice-pls look on sched to see if I met with Walt in Februrary, on Hoffman"s birthday. Walt claims I walked with
               him to wish Hoffman happy bday- and supposedly talked about Wooten on that walk (evidently "pressuring" him?)
