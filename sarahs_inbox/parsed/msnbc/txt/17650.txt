        MESSAGE:

        Dear Governor Palin,

        I sent this email on April 18th to Mr. Seaton, and though I haven't received a reply as of
        yet, I wanted

        to share my concerns about this issue with you as well. Please let me know what your
        thoughts are on

        this, and how we can rectify this ever growing, and escalating, problem. I know you have
        school age

        children and hopefully understand where I'm coming from as well as other parents who share
        the same

        views.      What do we do?

        Thank you for your time.

        Sincerely,

        Leona Alexander

         Dear Mr . Seaton,

         My name is Leona Alexander .          I live here in Homer , and this up and coming school year, my
         son will be

         attending Homer High School .         As a parent of a soon to be freshman , my husband and I, and
         many other

         parents of soon to be freshman , were invited to the Homer High School library to attend an
         orientation to

         explain what to expect for our child ' s education.

         Dr. Keffer , the principal , explained to us what the situation with the school funding, or
         the potential

         lack of, was .  Dr. Keffer told us that there have been approximately four studies total,
         done by outside

         sources, hired by the State of Alaska ,         that suggested the Kenai Peninsula Borough School
         District has

         been under funded by $ 10 million dollars per year, for that last several years .                     The first
         three reports

        done by these outside sources didn't provide the answers that the State wanted to hear so
        our School

        District was dismissed .        The last study provided by the last outside source ,              came up with
        the same study

        and suggestions . The State of Alaska decided that maybe the sources had been correct and
        gave the School

        District approximately $ 2 million dollars .           Now, this information that I have relayed to
        you, provided by

        Dr. Keffer isn't verbatim, but it's pretty close and the dollar amounts are.                       I am
        completely, and

        utterly disgusted and very frustrated.

        I knew that all of this was a big issue .           My husband and I have been listening over the
        past few years,

        knowing in the back of our minds that our son was going to be a part of this situation. I
        think that

        both of us had hoped that the State of Alaska would make things better by the time our son
        got to High

        School . This has not happened .          And it is extremely scary that the direction that we're
        heading for, by

        not properly funding our children ' s future is getting worse and I don't see any support
        for our schools.



        I have a daughter who will be in Homer High School in four years .                  What will the lack of
        our schools

        funding be then? To what extreme will it be then ?               Why is it that nobody is listening and
        doing

        something about it? I don't want to hear excuses why there is failure to provide our
        schools the funds
                                                               2




                                                                                                          PRA GSP01_0001305

         that our children deserve. I want to hear ,         for once , how our state is making a difference
         in mine, and

         everyone else 's child's life.        Where is the money? Where is the priority?              Where's the
         sense of urgency?



         Since I have been a parent participating / volunteering in my children ' s lives, I hear from
         so many

         parents , that because of the direction our schools are heading , because of teacher cuts,
         classroom sizes

         are too large ,    etc., they are either pulling , or have pulled their children out of the
         schools to

         homeschool .    It's become a vicious cycle .      There ' s not enough money because of the low
         enrollment,

         there ' s low enrollment because parents are tired of all the lack of funding ,                then more
         parents start

         home-schooling.      Look at what has been created ......... it's a cycle that can be stopped.
         Give the

         parent ' s a reason to leave their children enrolled in public schools .               Parents are
         responsible for

        raising our children to the best of our ability .           Our public schools are responsible for
        providing the

        best education that money can buy .        All of us are entitled to it .          This is our future, how
        can we just

        dismiss this responsibility?

        My husband , Rick , suggested that I contact you. I figured that you could either direct me
        in the right

        direction, or pass this message to the whomever it needs to go.

        Thanks for your time ,      and I really appreciate any help you can provide with this very
        important matter.



        Sincerely,

        Leona Alexander
