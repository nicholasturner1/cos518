        We miss you Sharon! Hope you're having the best time ever, though.

        We rolled out the quarter-billion dollar budget cuts today. Yikes. We'll feel the reaction
        as folks start digging in to see their pet projects on the slash list. So far, so good
        though!  I think we were able to explain sound priorities and this should be ok at the end
        of the day.



        Enjoy your trip!
