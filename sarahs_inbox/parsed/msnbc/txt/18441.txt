          The encouragement in the message sent by selecting a rural location has to do with
          personal accountability, wise investment of personal pfd checks, wise investments on the
          PF Corp's part, need for resource development wealth to trickle down to individual
          Alaskans because it's OUR oil, pfd checks will help with outrageous energy costs in
          rural...




          This ties in with our agenda of personal responsiblity, need for AGIA and other
          developments...

         Subject: PFD Announcement



         Governor,



         As we discussed last night, you would like the announcement of the PFD amount this year to
         be made in the bush rather than a big ballroom in Anchorage or Fairbanks.   Based on our
         discussion, I got the impression that you would like to be there to make the announcement.
         The announcement should be made September 19, 20, or 21.



         I asked the PFD folks to look at some statistics to see if any bush community stands out
         in any way. So far, I have the following;



         Scammon Bay has the highest percentage of kids applying for PFD's (52.5%).



         If we're just looking for a rural hub to use, and we stick to the AK Air locations, we can
         choose from: Kotzebue, Nome, Barrow, King Salmon, Bethel, and Dillingham.



         Let me know how you want to proceed.



         -Pat
