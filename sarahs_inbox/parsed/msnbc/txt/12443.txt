                 Subject : State Earmarks/Stevens' Posting

                Senator Stevens has just posted the State's 31 earmark requests on his website. I
                think he believes that this will point out the discrepancy between your statements
                and our actions.

                As I said to him this morning , I don't see any problem with the posting. We believe
                that all of our earmarks pass muster in terms of the criteria the Congressional
                delegation and the Bush administration have espoused.
