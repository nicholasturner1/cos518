          Mr. Stephen Branchflower



          Dear Mr. Branchflower:



                Thank you for your e-mail dated August 3, 2008, requesting an informal meeting with
          Governor Palin and her staff. Governor Palin would be happy to accommodate such a
          meeting, but she will be in Fairbanks on August 12. She will be in Anchorage, however, on
          August 13 -15. Please contact Janice Mason at (907) 465-3986, and she will coordinate a
          time that works for both you and the Governor.



                Please be advised that the Governor has authorized the Department of Law to
          coordinate the response of the Governor to this investigation. The project manager for
          the Department of Law is Mike Barnhill. His phone number is (907) 465-4118. We would
          request that you copy Mr. Barnhill on all of your correspondence with this office
          regarding this matter.



                  The contact persons for the Governor in this matter are Mr. Barnhill and I.




                               Sincerely,




                                                   Michael A. Nizich
                                                             1
