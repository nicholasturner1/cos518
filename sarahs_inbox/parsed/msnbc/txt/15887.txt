               Dear Governor Palin

              I am writing you again hoping you will revisit your veto of $2 million dollars for the swimming pool for the Bethel
              region. I recently sent you the drowning statistics since the 1990's and newspaper clippings giving you the history
              of our effort to get a swimming pool/multi use facility. I don't know that you would have received it before the veto
              but I am hoping you can look that over as part of your reconsideration. Not only do we believe this will provide the
              opportunity to learn water safety and how to swim, it will also provide theraputic opportunities and provide a much
              needed healthy alternative to address some of our problems such as diabeties, obesity and alcoholism. Healthy
              outlets for all people living out here are much needed.

              The citizens of Bethel showed their support by voting in a one cent increase on the sales tax for two years then a half a
              cent for 18 years for the operation, maintenance & construction for this project.  An endowment fund is being set up
              so that 20 years from now when the sales tax ends we can still pay for it. Your reconsideration would support our
              efforts. Please call me at 543-3239 (home) at any time if you have questions.

              Sincerely,


              Beverly A. Hoffman, Chair
              Bethel Ad Hoc Recreation Facility Committee
