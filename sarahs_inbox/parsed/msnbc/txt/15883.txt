           MESSAGE:

           Governor Palin,




           As the rumor's float about as you becoming a possible running mate for the VP slot, I
           simply wanted to say that I was so excited about that prospect that it literally sent
           chills through me.




           I hope that if you are approached to do so that you will strongly consider it. I think
           having a strong conservative voice in the office will greatly benefit the Republican
           party, and will go a long way towards regaining focus.




           While I would certainly understand why you might not want to accept such a position,
           especially with having a new born, I look forward to casting my ballot for you.
                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0018988
