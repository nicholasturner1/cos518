             Before the summer driving season kicks in- and that ' s assuming we may

             not need legislation to eliminate collection of the gas tax. I'm hearing

             there are ways we may get to do this, and one catalyst is the Juneau

             power outage that some see as a vehicle to declare the necessity to give

             alaskans a break on outrageous energy costs.

              Governor,



              Are these discussions in preparation for another special session call?

              Or are you looking at action next year in the regular session?



              - Pat

              My desire is to go forth with eliminating this, and in addition we'll

              double this effort by making leggies act on my tire tax repeal bill also

              at the same time since it's still sitting there ready to be acted upon.

              So, whatever you guys gotta do to accomplish that, please do asap.

              Thanks

              (On my end I can enlist Kris and Ivy to help out... and I'll cc Russ

              when you let me know the most expedient way of accomplishing these two
