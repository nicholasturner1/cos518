                 Subject: March 1 Appointments

               Governor Palin,

               I'm attaching the last 4 boards with March 1 term expiration dates . These boards do n ot require legislative
               confirmation . I'm sending this today incase you want to print a hard copy for the plane or so you can read via
               your Pocket PC. I know you have other reading and sleep to catch up on , but just in case you feel up to reading
               my preliminary recommendations they are here for your consideration.

               I was purposely vague on some of the candidates because I think a conversation would be more appropriate. I
               have background information on all applicants and current board members . This email is to give you a sense of
               the boards and the members.

               Thank you for all of your time with boards and commission ! You've made my job enjoyable with your accessibility
               and all of your input. I've supplied Mike with a hard copy and will go over these boards with him today.
