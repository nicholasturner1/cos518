                 Governor,

                I talked to Barbara Thompson. This afternoon when the Board gives her a name or names, she will call me with
                the information to forward. It is my understanding that while you will be at an event in Wasilla, you will be
                accessible by email. I will email you and Mike with the information from Barbara. Depending on what name (or
                names) is given, we will proceed from there.

                The meeting is scheduled from 1:00 - 3:00, so it is hard to know precisely when the call will come, but I will get it
                to you as soon as possible.

                 Lynne
