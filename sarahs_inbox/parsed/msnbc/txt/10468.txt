              Frank,



              I have never sent my newsletter to my campaign lists. The couple thousand email addresses
              we use have been simply people who have signed up with my office requesting a newsletter.



              Sean

              Sean,



              For what its worth we aren't going to hand our campaign contacts list over to the State,
              but instead re-broadcast it to our list. My concern has always been misusing the lists
              for something other than what folks signed up for.



              Just my 2 cents. :-)
