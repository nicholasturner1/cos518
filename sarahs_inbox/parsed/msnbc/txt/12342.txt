                Solicitor General of the United States
                Office of the Solicitor General

                Re: Southeast Alaska Conservation Council et al. v . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

                Dear Solicitor General Clement:

                I have been an Alaska Commercial Fisherman for over 40 years. During that time I have always
                been involved in the broad array of issues that could have an impact on the clean water and
                habitat that is vital to the health of my industry. Such is the case of the Kensington Mine located
                near one. of our very successful salmon fisheries in Lynn Canal.

                For nearly 20-years other Southeast Alaska Gillnetters and I have followed Coeur Alaska and
                Goldbelt in their efforts to open the Kensington Gold Mine and build a dock at Cascade Point.
                They have frequently requested our input to insure that the developments would have no impact
                on a valuable fishery. Our communications have been productive and resulted in a mutually
                acceptable project that was permitted by all the agencies in July 2005.

                It was important that during construction, Coeur Alaska hired and contracted locally. In fact,

                 over 50% of a plus 380 person work force was Native-affiliated. Unfortunately, those year-round, high
                 paying jobs were halted by the injunction.

                 We ask that you join Coeur Alaska and Goldbelt Inc. and urge the Supreme Court to review the decision
                 of the Ninth Circuit Court in which SEACC, Lynn Canal Conservation, and the Sierra Club sued the
                 agencies for granting 404 permits to Coeur Alaska and Goldbelt . It is our opinion that the agencies were
                 correct in issuing these permits and that the Ninth Circuit Court has made a questionable reading of the
                 Clean Water Act in this case.

                The decision by the Ninth Circuit Court vacating Goldbelt's 404 permit is a gross injustice to the intent
                of Congress when it enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act providing these lands to Goldbelt
                with the intent that they be used for economic development and betterment of Goldbelt's stockholders.
                It is disappointing that SEACC, Lynn Canal Conservation and the Sierra Club are using this lawsuit to
                block Goldbelt's ability to develop its land in an environmentally responsible manner.

                Sincerely,


                Jim Becker
