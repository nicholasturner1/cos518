Kris- please forward to Franci and our Ag Board our sincere appreciation for everything! It was an
amazing month - the board members made tough, sound, smart decisions and Alaska is grateful for
their tremendous efforts. Today's ADN editorial is a nice "kudos" to the board and new Ag leadership
and should be encouragement as they seek answers to the ongoing challenges. Thanks Kris!
