  Todd, Becky & I would like to invite You, Sarah and family to our new house
  and the Mall for a meet & greet, some time this summer! ! We know you guys
  are busy, but we would love to see the new baby and family. We could also
  have a set up at the Mall to give time to people to see you again, as we are
  managing the Peninsula Center Mall again. Call if you get a chance, Glen
