            God knows the truth.-- that we're being falsely accused of having done something wrong.
           Defend us, Lord.

             Yep. Bound and determined. He told us Huggins was the one saying we had done something
           wrong. I asked Wesley if he asked lawmakers if they do the same thing and of course he
           said no.

                Sharon tells me that reporters are inquiring about our thoughts on the

                overall spending levels. There's still time to get a statement into

                tomorrow's papers, should we choose to go that route. Are you

                interested?

                So we'll need to be proactive in our budget message and get out in front

               of the critics' message that you know is coming (from the leggies and

               our usual critics): that WE grew the budget unsustainably, due to the

               operating budget increases, and that WE have no fiscal discipline. Let's

               try not to have to react to what's coming, but get in front with

               messaging while explaining increases ,        including tax credits. And

               explaining again our need to reign in their capital spending via

               sensible vetoes.



               Again though, can we veto anything out of that final operating budget?
