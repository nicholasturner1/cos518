              Cora is working on this and a few names are filing in to review.

                  Im reading today's article, ADN, about Penney's earmark from Stevens - it says the governor received a
                  letter Sept 14 questioning the funds. Was that me, or was some letter sent Sept 14 during prior
                  administration?

                  Because i have not seen, nor heard about, any letter. In fact, except in passing when I heard Larry and
                  Mike mention the ADN was on to another Stevens/Penney issue, I have never been informed nor privy to
                  any info on this issue.

                  I feel I need to be informed of these issues that deal with the state and end up on the front page of the
                  newspaper. Please, if that letter was sent to me, allow me to see it. I would think I'd be asked about this
                  issue , and we're lucky I wasn't already asked when a couple of reporters stopped me last week for Stevens'
                  issues/comments.
