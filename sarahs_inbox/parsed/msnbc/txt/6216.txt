           Sounds great.      It'd be so much better if Todd could make it.

            Yup no sweat on the trip. 5pm tonight is the deadline on tkts so if its a go we'll need
           to know before then, but I can understand Todd's concerns as well.



             You have no idea how jazzed I am about Michael W!!!!! Been to several of his shows and
           performed his songs since the early 80's. Thank you SOOO00000 much. Too bad about
           Annette, she is a really good person and would have loved to make it I'm sure.

            Hi fb. I'm talking to todd about trip if/when he calls this morn. He thinks it makes no
          sense , the logistical headaches plus the costs for a short amount of time. He may be right
          - so don't sweat it if it doesn't come together - I'll let u know as soon as he let's me
          know.




            Annette was invited to join us for Michael W Smith lunch - shell be out of town and is
          so bummed be he's a favorite of her's. She told Janice shed be crying herself to sleep in
          her pillow knowing she missed meeting him.




            I guess the Gov's House is pretty torn up w/repairs, hope he'll overlook that!
