            Ok- and I knew they were our bills but wondered who ushered them through for us.

            PERS /TRS was your bill and Rev       Sharing was Senate C&RA ,       but certainly we

            can invite any legislators to the signing.



            Both bills can be signed any time between now and next Tuesday. So, we

            have time if we need it. Mike was going to talk to you about these

            bills today and the options for signing them, but, the nice thing is we

            don't have to pile on for today if you don't want to. It's an option.

            Also PRS/TRS... Who sponsored and when due ? I can't do what we did on

            the Educ Bill and sign it without giving credit to any of the friendly

            legislators who pushed our agenda there . We took unnecessary heat for

            signing Educ Bill without crediting leggies ,            so have to be aware this

            time of that issue again.
