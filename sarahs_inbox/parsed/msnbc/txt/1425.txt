  Todd,

  Do you know Ingrid Cumberlidge from Dillingham? Rep Edgemon recommended her for a
  public seat on the Emergency Medical Services Council. She hasn't sent in a resume yet, so
  I wanted to check in with you.

  Thanks!

  Ivy

  Ms. Frye,

  Thank you for both your contact and Rep. Edgmon's reommendation. I am at a training
  just now, so it will be a week before I can get back to you with an application. Please let
  me know if that timeline is acceptable. I am very interested in an appointment to Alaska
  Council on Emergency Medical Services.

  Sincerely,

  E. Ingrid Cumberlidge

  Hi Ingrid,

  You were recommended to Governor Palin's boards and commissions office as a potential
  candidate to serve on a board by Representative Edgmon. We are reviewing several boards
  right now and are looking for candidates. Two boards in particular we'd like to make
  appointments to are the Alaska Council on Emergency Medical Services, and the Suicide
  Prevention Council. Here is the application if you are interested in throwing your hat in the
  ring http://qov.state.ak.us/boards/bc application.pdf.

  Please let me know if you have any questions.

  Ivy Frye
  Office of Governor Sarah Palin
