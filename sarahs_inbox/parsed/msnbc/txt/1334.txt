Todd, I'm sending the thank you letter with the DHL package going to Anchorage this afternoon.
There's a letter that was sent to you by 1st Gentleman , Dan Mulhern ; it states that it is confidential
and he asked that staff not pre-read it. Have a great weekend! Erika

Hi Todd,



I received a check, for the Super Bowl fundraiser, from Raymond & Sally Matiashowski for $250. I
have the letter printed and ready for you to sign. Would you like for me to send it to the Anchorage
office or directly to your home? I'll send an envelope that's addressed and has postage, it's probably
easier for you just to drop it in the mail then to send it back to me.



Thanks,

Erika
