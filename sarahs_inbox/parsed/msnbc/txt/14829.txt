           Governor-

           Sean interviewed Kelly about a perceived conflict of interest as she is dating Kim
           Hutchinson, a lobbyist. He wanted to know if they were domestic partners and whether he
           would have any influence on her decision making etc. After the interview sean told me he
           didn't see a story but said it was up to his editors. This is just an FYI so you are not
           caught off guard in case anything comes of it. Thanks

           We don't want to get their hopes up, so I wouldn't offer them anything in the way of a
           comment at this point. I haven't seen the letter, but you don't have to acknowledge that.
           We're working on a statewide high-energy-cost relief plan, I met with Tom Pat Marty Joe on
           it today... Maybe they'd have something to offer re: statewide relief (so we're not just
           looking at Juneau). I'll cc them in.

            The Juneau Empire is asking about a letter you received yesterday from the Juneau
            delegation . in the letter , they outlined why they believe the Disaster Policy Cabinet
            erred by defining a disaster too narrowly .   Mike Nizich is hoping to arrange a
            teleconference with you , himself and General Campbell tomorrow at 2 p . m. to discuss the
            findings and options to move forward .   I don ' t have much to tell the Empire at this point.
             May I tell the Empire about the impending meeting?
