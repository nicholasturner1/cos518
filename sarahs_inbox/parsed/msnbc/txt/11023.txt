              And the ear, at least.



              Thank you so much for your boldness on this - and ivy's. Others would have said: oh leave
              it alone, we don't want to offend her, we may need her down the road...

              Gag.   I'm tired of every word I say being picked apart and misconstrued, when lyda,
              halcro, fagan, etc get away with outright lies. Especially untruths coming from lya- she's
              the sen prez and must quite spinning these things without beibg held accountable.

              Alrighty....just got off line with Lyda. She has plenty of gray area, saying she "was
              told by one of the guys who co-hosted the event that he 'told all of them to come on
              over'.". She then said, "it was not by me, I didn't invite her.". When I asked her to
              recall which co-host, she thought about it a bit and said she really couldn't remember.



              I said, "oh so the Gov wasn 't individually invited?". She said "I think they just said
              ,you guys come on over #".



              Very vague .... and I thought there was only one co - host ?             Why's she saying she can't
              remember?



              I'm not sure here , but I ' ll get with Sharon and imatbe we can get mainstream media to do a
              little contrast.



              At very least I know Eddie Burke will pick up on it.

              How can we check her on it now - depending on what Frank / Ivy find? Someone call reporters?
              Me put out a personal statement on it?

               Will do. Also in response to the emails about Lyda, I too think she should be called out
              on this. Her dishonesty shouldn't go unchecked... it'll be interesting what Frank
              discovers.

               May we do this tomorrow? I suppose mike could/would be on teleconf, but I'd like to

              too?

               I agree . We need to get moving forward. This is a priority issue for the state. I
              think it would be good to have Larry attend for his perspective tied in to climate change.

              I'm anxious to meet with u guys on energy - we'll meet with mike (and whomever else in
             the room needs to be there) to make sure he's hearing the scoop re: energy coordinator,
             streamlined agencies, etc. There's too much miscommunication or refusal on his part to
             understand the urgency on this.  Larry a part of this too?

              Lyda said on the news I received a verbal invitation to her fundraiser. She's either
             lying again, or did a verbal go through you or anyone and it wasn't passed on to me? If
             she lied again, it would be nice for Alaskans if she we held accountable for more
             deception.
