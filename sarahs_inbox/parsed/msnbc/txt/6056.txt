        Are you interested in calling into Mike Porcaro? He's quite excited as well about your
        cuts - we spoke about it for a bit today.



        The call would have to happen around 4:05pm.

        Don't want to call and prevent you from listening to Fagan, but great job on the air.
        Sounds like Alaskans like it, too.
