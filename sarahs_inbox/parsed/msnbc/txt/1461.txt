  Hi from George and Cassandra Sikat

  When your two years old you don't care if it's raining outside.
  That you could catch a cold or worse pneumonia.
  That no one else is out there to play with you.

  Yesterday Georgie showed me how to be a kid again, how to play in the mud.
  We had a blast splashing in the puddles, catching a rain drop on our tongue
  and just walking in the rain. and yes, we were singing.

  I love being a Daddy!

  George and Family (The Sikat's)
