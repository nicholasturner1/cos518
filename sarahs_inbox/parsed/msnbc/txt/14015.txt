             Also PRS/TRS... who sponsored and when due? I can't do what we did on the Educ Bill and
             sign it without giving credit to any of the friendly legislators who pushed our agenda
             there. We took unnecessary heat for signing Educ Bill without crediting leggies, so have
             to be aware this time of that issue again.

             Who sponsored that bill, the $60million budget              item? And when is that bill signing due?
