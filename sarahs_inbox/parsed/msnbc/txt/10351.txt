              They should have titled this article "Palin to line the pockets of Department of Education
              Buracrats" instead of mislabeling it as "boosting education". Shame on you ADN!

              Well, good thing our state is more concerned with raiding the tresury and passing out 11%
              raises (just in time for Christmas!) instead of keeping the heating system of our schools
              in good working order. http ://www.adn . com/news / alaska /matsu/story/9503691p-9414426c.html




              Glad the state can afford to pass out lit raises and boost healthcare benifits all of the
              sudden, because surely that is not the same stupid, irresponsible behaivoir that got us
              8.4 Billion dollars behind in the state pension to begin with.
