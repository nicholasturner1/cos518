          I'm here at Outdoor Show at Sullivan- Jerry Dickman, case #01-27579 says we haven't solved
          his Big Lake/ Burma Rd break - in case and he wants his Evinrude motor back that was stolen
          and he says the guys who stole it is John Harold Scott. Jerry says he's going to take it
          back at gunpoint. I told him not to do that yet (it's been six and yrs) and that I
          promised I'd email you first and you'd help him. Jerry's #355-4474. He's standing right
          next to me - he knows I 'm requesting assistance for him on this.



          Thanks!
