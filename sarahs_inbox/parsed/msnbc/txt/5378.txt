                  News-Miner would like to know if you still feel this way or disavow yourself
                  of the comments below.

                  For tomorrow.

                  Hi Meg,

                  Here's a portion of the text from the May 6, 2005 full- page ad that appeared
                  in the News-Miner and in support of the Alaska Gasline Port Authority's
                  project:

                  "As concerned citizens who love Alaska, we are speaking up in favor of the
                  best and only proposal that provides maximum benefits to the state. The risk
                  of inaction is too high. We urge you to get involved, too."

                  Gov. (then mayor) Palin appeared in the ad, and provided her signature,
                  along with Hammond, Hickel and Halford.

                  I'd like to know if the governor stands by the statement that the port
                  authority plan is the "best and only proposal that provides maximum benefits
                  to the state," disavows that statement, or has some other comment on it.
