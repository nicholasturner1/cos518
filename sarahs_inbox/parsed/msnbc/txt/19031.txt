         Greetings ,   Commissioner ,   Ted, and Sally!



        The Governor has asked that I help you prepare a response to the recent and stunning news
        that Agrium shall soon close. (See her e-mail below.)

                                                                    1

          It may be worth pointing out that last month , on August 25,           2007,   the Governor signed into
          law landmark legislation aimed at helping Agrium avert this grim action.



          As you know , that measure was House Bill 229 , sponsored by Nikiski Representative Mike
          Chenault.



         It authorized the Alaska Railroad Corporation to issue an unprecedented sum of $2.9
         billion in tax-exempt bonds to help pay for coal gasification and electrical power
         generation facilities near the Agrium fertilizer plants as well as facilities and
         equipment to transport coal from Healy by rail to Point MacKenzie and by barge from Point
         MacKenzie to the Kenai.




         Up to three million tons of coal per year could be used to create hydrogen that Agrium
         needs to produce ammonia and to help generate power.




         Agrium's current design for the power plant is for 190 megawatts of power. The plan called
         for Agrium to buy 120 megawatts of that. The rest, some 70 megawatts, would be available
         for distribution along the Kenai power grid.



         This may not be much, but I hope it helps.



         October 2 is my last day in the Governor ' s Office .      I am on personal leave until then.



         But if you need anything , please don ' t hesitate to reach me at this e - mail address
         ( cgcalaska@yahoo.com).



         Good luck and all the very , very best,



        Chris
