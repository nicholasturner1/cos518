            MESSAGE:

            Congratulations on the birth of your fourth child. I wanted to let you know that I also
            gave birth to a son with DS 21 years ago. He as my fourth child as well and I want to
            tell you that he has been an absolute positive experience for our family. Our son David
            has been employed competitively for teh last 3.5 years and attended a local college for
            additional vocational training.  He will be moving into his own apartment with minimal
            support in July.

            DS is not a debilitating condition however it is one that requires frequent " enabling"

           With our son we assumed that he could do things until we found out that he couldn't and
           then we made accomodations. There are very few things that David can not do that a
           typical individual can.

           If you would ever want to talk you are free to email me at bechtoldcindy@gmail.com or
           contact me via telephone.



           Good luck with your family and best wishes for your success.
