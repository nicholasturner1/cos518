           MESSAGE:

           Dear Gov. Palin:



           Congratulations to you and your family on the birth of your son Trig Paxson Van Palin!
           What a beautiful, positive,example you and your husband have given to acknowledge the
           beautiful, God-given gift of life.



           In this cynical, darkened world of ours, you and your husband have chosen not to hide your
           lights under a bushel basket, but to let your lights shine!   Thank you for brightening
           our world.



           Many blessings to you and your family!



          .Patricia Dorn
