                                            CONFIDENTIAL - DELIBERATIVE PROCESS PRIVILEGE

               Pat:

               In roughly 2 weeks we should be receiving information from KABATA regarding several terms described to us as
               "absolute must haves" by KABATA staff (Niemic / Hemengway) These terms include a traffic /revenue guarantee
               where the state would have to pay if traffic projections did not materialize ; responsibility for millions of dollars a
               year in delay costs if environmental groups appeal the Corps permit, etc., and the financial risks and costs
               attached to those terms that would be imposed on the state. We should also be receiving updated costs
               estimates on the project. (The current cost estimate for the bridge at $630 million are 3 years old and do not
               include a new Ingra-Gambell exchange at an estimate of roughly $250 million (which KABATA staff have told me
               must be the responsibility of the state to pay for) or all the road work on the Mat -Su side of the bridge that DOT
               would have to build, roughly $4-500 million)

               At that time, I would like to brief the 'Governor and ask how she would like to proceed:

              Privileged or Personal Material Redacted




              Commissioner. Would you like to be invited to the briefing for the Governor and be copied with KABATA's
              responses?

              Please call me today after 9 :00 am if you have any questions or any thoughts on how to proceed. (I will be
              working with Leo - 8-8:30 and then Walt 8:30 to 9:00)

               Randy,

               Could we have a coordinated discussion of the Administration 's position on KABATA before
               too long? I think we are all heading in the same direction , but there are a lot of issues to be
               evaluated , and options explored . I'm not sure who should coordinate the discussion, but
               you're a good candidate . Is that something you can set up? Thanks.

               -Pat
