             She's be great , and really the job isn't based in Juneau - I went 'round

             and 'round with Tibbles on that, explaining it'd be too tough to find a

             flexible individual if we forced him or her to stay full-time in Juneau

             (same issue we face trying to fill so many positions ), so this position

             (along with most others) will be flexible. Remeber that outside the Leg

             session , no one ' s really in the capitol bldg , certainly no media.

             They're mostly in Anchorage. If you want to talk to          Privile   let me know

            on several things. The job is based in Juneau. I wonder if she would

            move?
