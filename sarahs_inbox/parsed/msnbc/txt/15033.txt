                 Subject: Commissioner Von Scheben / Juneau Access

               Governor:

               Commissioner Von Scheben called to confirm our position that we would NOT be going out to bid on a small part
               of the Juneau Access project . I told him we would not as there is no final Corps permit that has passed EPA
               review, the project is already under litigation on NEPA points , and that until all the litigation is over and we know
               exactly what type of project is even legally possible, (if any), we would not be going ahead with bidding a small
               part of the road.

               He said he certainly understood , but may ask for 5-10 minutes of your time at the end of May after we are through
               with the capital budget to brief you on the status of the project , litigation , permits, etc.,

               Randy
