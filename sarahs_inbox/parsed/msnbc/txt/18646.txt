        Governor,

        Mike Tibbles asked me to forward the attached proposed letter from the DC office drafted
        by John Katz, Diane Barrans, and Larry Persily for your consideration.

        It relates to the proposed federal rules covering the relationship between lenders and
        colleges and universities that could hurt the ability of the Alaska Commission on
        Postsecondary Education to provide the best services and lowest-cost loans to Alaska
        students (an unintended consequence of the federal crackdown on sweetheart deals between
        some lenders and some schools) which is exactly what the commission is told to do under
        state law.

        Lynne
