                Please do not support these bills. They go contrary to the repeated wishes of the public, and I am very,
                very disappointed that Gov. Palin has even brought them forward . It is wrong.
                I strongly support the opinions as expressed by Mr. Nick Jens in yesterday ' s Anchorage Daily News.

                I quote from that "...... the issue of aerial wolf and bear shooting pales in comparison to the real issue at
                stake: the democratic process. " "........ strike down HB 348 , and SB176/HB256 , not because of your
                convictions regarding aerial predator control , but because of your convictions in a government of the
                people , by the people , and for the people."

                I am truly shocked that, you , Gov. Palin would support this, after all the wonderful strides you have made
                to provide a more open government, and you have . But this legislation flies in the face of that.

                Please defeat HB 348 and SB 176 /HB256.

                Thank you,
