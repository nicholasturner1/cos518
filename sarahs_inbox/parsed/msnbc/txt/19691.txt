           Governor,



           I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, I'll let Diane and Susan know that you were fine with
           having staff at the event and that I misunderstood.



           I felt bad leaving Kelly, Anna and Mindy there to clean-up so I mentioned that it felt odd
           leaving, but that you didn't want staff to stay. Sorry- I didn't quite get that right and
           complicated things.




           Thanks for letting me know.



           Erika

           Erika- hopefully there was no misunderstanding tonight- I heard after the event tonight
           that you said I did not want you or staff there. That's far from anything I said. I just
           wanted to make sure you knew that with all the staffers attending the reception, there
           would be plenty of assistance to clean up, etc. Please make sure Diane and Suzi know that
           also.

              Just trying to not burden anyone with last-minute plans that are usually out of my
           control even. It all went well, the food was great, pies excellent... and never meant for
           you to believe I didn't want you there. Thanks

                 I thought I had picked up all of Meg Stapleton 's language. I will send an addendum to our statement
                 containing the language you mention now.

                Per Rosanne and Sharon, this statement went out awhile ago to Megan Holland at the ADN.




                Former Commissioner Monegan has asked several questions of me through reporter Megan Holland. My response
                to those questions follows:

                Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware he had several various plans in the works related to staffing and recruitment
                and retention. Like the legislature, I was focused and aware of a lack of results in recruiting and retention. Action
                and results, not words are the bottom line. For nearly two years there were very high numbers of vacancies in the
                troopers with nearly 1 in 7 positions being unfilled. There were 56 vacancies as of June 30, 2008. 1 was also aware

               Fw: Copy of statement sent to Megan Holland                                                                         Page 2 of 2


               that regardless of any plans of Mr. Monegan ' s, no new positions would be approved by the legislature until vacancies were
               filled, which made it even more important to get the job done.

               Mr. Monegan has asked if I was aware of a draft 2007 annual report . I was aware of the draft and in fact, had several
               questions about it that Mr. Monegan never answered. My special assistant and Chief-of-Staff were also reviewing the draft.
               The fact that W. Monegan prepared .a detailed draft written report of the troopers ' activities in 2007 does not change the
               bottom line or lack of results under Mr. Monegan.

               W. Monegan has suggested that I did not meet with him. This is wrong. In addition to several face -to-face meetings, Walt-
               and I spent much more time together discussing the future and direction of public safety , and my desire for immediate
               action. Remember that Walt and I had many opportunities, dozens of discussions at events throughout the state , including
               one-on-one time together on the state 's plane traveling to the bush. That's in addition to every cabinet meeting, every
               reception, other trips, and phone calls that I personally had with Walt. To suggest that he had four opportunities with me in
               17 months to discuss public safety is untruthful . Also notable, are the meetings and conversations that my staff had with
               Walt on my behalf, including meetings and conversations with fellow Commissioners , the Chief-of-Staff, Deputy Chief-of-
               Staff, Attorney General, Special Assistants, etc. There is not one instance where Walt was turned down for a
                meeting, a phone call, or any type of conversation.

               While I have been busy with AGIA, I pay attention and take care of the state 's business on all other fronts as well , and will
               continue to do so.
