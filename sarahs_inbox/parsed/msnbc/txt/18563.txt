               re-wrote in my words (and code words!), this is still probably a lot longer than what they're
               expecting tho. so feel free to chop if you need to.

               some inconsistencies were edited out according to the new info we received on ACES intent, as
               revealed in all the edits we did on the ACES op-ed piece the last few days... and Pat and Joe still
               need to look at this to make sure it's factual be all those inconsistencies have to have been
               eliminated in this speech. thanks
