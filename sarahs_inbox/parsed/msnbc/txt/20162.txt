            Governor - I received a call from Charles Adams, Communications Advisor Department for
            Senator McCain.   Mr. Adams was inquiring as to whether or not you would be interested in
            participating in a National Press Call on Wednesday, 08.06.08. This would be with their
            National Pool of Reporters. It has very good attendance on calls. It would help the
            elected official.   It would be a total of 15 minutes of your time and would be in regards
            to Energy.  They do these National Press Calls each week. This is tentative at this time
            depending on your interest to participate. Thanks, Janice
