         Remarks for Bouchercon 2007 Reception




         Thursday, Sept. 27 @ 6:30 p.m.



         Egan Center




         I am pleased to welcome you to this gathering of mystery and adventure writers, and
         mystery fiction fans to Alaska.




         I want to recognize a special group of writers - Alaska Sisters in Crime. Congratulations
         to the members of this wonderful group for all their work - they are involved in so many
         projects that support literacy around Alaska.




        They have arranged for 27 writers to work with students in our Bush schools. For the last
        five years this dedicated organization has purchased books for every library in the state.
        And Sisters in Crime held a pre-conference workshop for students and teachers who are
        interested in mystery writing.

         As Governor , I am pleased that you recognize that Alaska ' s wilderness is a world-class
         setting for mystery, drama and adventure.




         But as Governor, I have solemn and important official obligations to discharge this
         evening.




         As Alaska's chief law enforcement official, one of my primary responsibilities is to
         ensure that our many out - of-state visitors understand - and abide by - the requirements of
         Alaska's criminal laws.




         And so, I am obligated to inform everyone at this convention that Alaska's criminal law
         prohibits bad writing.




         In fact, Alaska's laws include a crime called "Malicious Mystery Fiction Writing in the
         First Degree."




        This law was enacted years ago by the Alaska Legislature to express Alaskans '             frustration
        with bad fiction writers.




        Alaska law now provides that a writer commits the crime of Malicious Mystery Fiction
        Writing in the First Degree if the writer produces any work of fiction that frustrates the
        reader:




                                                       4




                                                                                                   PRA GSP01_0005687

          *      by stretching a 200 page story out to 800 pages

                 by including any illogical plot twist

          *      by withholding critical clues to the very last chapter

          *      by beginning any work of fiction with the line, "It was a dark and stormy night..."

         *       or by setting any work of fiction in Alaska which includes descriptions of penguins!




         In Alaska, Malicious Mystery Fiction Writing in the First Degree is a felony offense.




         In fact, if the writer is a serial novelist - each volume in the series constitutes a
         separate , criminal offense . Consecutive sentences are mandatory.




         Our law also provides that if a work of fiction is set in Alaska, and then the author
         sells the movie rights to a producer who films the movie in British Columbia - a maximum
         jail sentence is required.




         You should know that Alaska is one of the few states to have this law. And we have found
         it has been very successful.




         We have found that bad fiction writers - once they became aware of this law - have simply
         left Alaska , and chosen to commit their crimes elsewhere.




         I realize that some of you here tonight may find this law troublesome.

         (pause)




        But I have some good news for you tonight.




        Alaska ' s Constitution provides that the Governor may issue Executive Pardons.




        So, should any of you be fearful that any Alaska law enforcement agency may investigate or
        bring charges against anyone at this convention for the crime of Malicious Fiction Writing
        - I am here tonight to exercise my constitutional authority of Executive Clemency.
