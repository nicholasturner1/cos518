          Hello Foundation Members,

          Things are coming together quite nicely for the fundraiser! I've attached a rough
          draft for the agenda/program and there's a sign-up list below. If you have any
          suggestions please give me a call or send an email, as things are not set in stone.
          Mr. Palin and Wayne Jensen have an appt. tomorrow at 1:30pm.to discuss the
          history of the House, as well as the current and upcoming projects. I also hope to go
          over the program with them if time permits. If anyone would like to join us, please
          let me know, as you're more then welcome to attend.

          Reception
             · Guests can make their donations as they enter and are then free to enjoy the
                horsedeuvres and mingle for a bit.
             · 5:15pm. or so (when the doorbell stops ringing) we'll gather in the Ballroom for a
                short program.
             · The layout for the event will be the same as last years, with the welcoming table at
                the top of the stairs and the merchandise table in the Grand Hall in front of the
                fireplace. For the centerpiece we will use the large gingerbread Governor's House
                that the Stefani made for the Open House. It should look very nice!

          Thank you gift options:
          1. The guest receives a Governor's House pin or zipper pull (their choice) as they arrive
          and
             make their donation. It's small enough that it wouldn't be a bother to carry with them.
          2. Another option would be to have them mark their choice, and we could send the
          pin/zipper-pull
             with their thank you note.

              . There' s a question concerning how many pins do we give a group when they give a
                donation and they attend the event? The Alaska Committee has RSVP' d their
                attendance and will be making a $ 1,000 donation . There are 18 members that we
                sent invitations to- so the question is how many pins would we give them? When you
                think that each pin costs about $ 3.50, we could give each of the 18 that attends a
                pin. Please let me know what your thoughts are on this.



                                                                                                       ROSTON 00233

       Sign Up List:

       1. Follow-Up phone calls tomorrow (T.5/8) for those who have not RSVP'd their attendance.
          If we have enough help, we can divide the guest list(s) up into a manageable size for phone calls.


       2. Merchandise table (2 volunteers)
          4:15-5:00:                   &
          5:00-5:45:                       &                       --The program will be during most of this slot.
          5:45-6:30:                       &

       3. Greeting Table (nice way to say that's where we'll take the money!) (2 volunteers)
          4:15-5:00:                   &
          5:00-5:45:                      &                        -- The program will be during most of this slot.
          5:45-6:30:                      &

       It would be great if we have 2 volunteers in case it's busy. There will be a bank bag for change
       and Visa and MasterCard forms at each of the tables.

       Agenda/Program
       I don't think it should be a long program, just something concise that covers-
       the history of the Foundation; the First Gentleman's goals for the Foundation and what he
       thinks the necessary House projects are (so they know what their donations are for);
       acknowledge the $5,000 contribution from David Stone (extra funds from campaign); give a
       brief history of the House, the status of the current projects and the necessary upcoming
       projects (Wayne Jensen); the guests are thanked for their generosity and support.

       I look forward to hearing from each of you!

       Best regards,
       Erika
