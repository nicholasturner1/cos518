           J- tonight looks to be the only night we can get to Chili's in Wasilla. Can you hook that
           up? (I think there would be four of us anyway available from the family)

           These look good. We won't commit to Cary's show tho in case I'm on the road at that time
           and it's too hectic. I'll call in there when I can.
