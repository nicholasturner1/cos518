        Governor,

        A good possibility for a small processor is Jack Schultheis of Kwikpak Fisheries. This is
        the company on the lower Yukon that Eric Olson works for. I'm still waiting for his
        resume, but I expect to have it soon. I know he has previous ASMI board experience and
        Kwikpak has a good reputation for quality.

        You asked if we could find someone for the large processor seat who is an Alaskan
        resident.   I did some research and did not find any large processors with an Alaska
        resident CEO.   Given this, Tom McLaughlin at Seafood Producer's Cooperative is probably
        still our best candidate. He lives in Bellingham.

        FYI, Icicle announced today that they are selling the company to a private equity firm in
        California, Fox Paine Management.  No management changes are expected.

        Cora

       Thanks! Yikes - that was embarassing and now I hate to have to put my name on those race
       registration forms.



       Also- what did we come up with for small processor to fill on the board? Cora was going to
       look. Also, the replacement for Giles on the board - where did we go there?
