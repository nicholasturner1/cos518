           Wasn't sure if the Gov wanted to send something, sometimes she does for in state causes.

           Hello - This should go to CR for the donation letter that is done in regards to "receiving
           many requests of this nature, therefore the Governor is not able to donate."



           Also, I have no idea what "week" this lady is referring to. Thanks, Janice

            MESSAGE:

            We are having a fundraiser to help local Fairbanks school kids to purchase school
            supplies.




            Our Cub Scouts are having a "Celebrity " sale to raise money to purchase items needed by
            our local kids.




            We would appreciate a donation of an item that Governor Palin could part with for this
            worthy cause.




            I believe Sarah will be in Fairbanks this week and could bring this item with her.




            Our community would be most grateful.




            In advance , thank you.




            Sincerely ,    Jean Shergalis Pack 155 1   907-322-6438
