          Yeah we'll need them to be more discerning be we ' re missing too many imp correspondence.
          And when its in Juneau time has to be carved out for me to go through Janice's files so i
          can read the stuff , and make sure we're responding.



         Also, the stuff sent up to Anchorage the better even if its                  duplicates.



          I'll talk to them if you give me names / contact #s

         Constituent relations opens all our mail and assigns a point person ( special assistant or
         leg office for example ). They could be asked to flag letters but up until now they are
         more of a lower level function and the responsibility is really the special assistant's
         role to determine the sensitivity.       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

          Im reading today's article, ADN, about Penney's earmark from Stevens - it says the
          governor received a letter Sept 14 questioning the funds. Was that me, or was some letter
          sent Sept 14 during prior administration?



          Because i have not seen, nor heard about, any letter. In fact, except in passing when I
          heard Larry and Mike mention the ADN was on to another Stevens/Penney issue, I have never
          been informed nor privy to any info on this issue.



          I feel I need to be informed of these issues that deal with the state and end up on the
          front page of the newspaper. Please, if that letter was sent to me, allow me to see it. I
          would think I'd be asked about this issue , and we're lucky I wasn't already asked when a
          couple of reporters stopped me last week for Stevens' issues/comments.
