             Amen. Thanks John. (And I can't handle staffer leaks, either.)

             Unfortunately, I think that Halcro's description of the meeting is pretty accurate. He
             missed a few details. For example, Pat was also there, and the gas team did far more in
             DC than just meet with the delegation.



             With the gas team, we are implementing initiatives in several quarters to address the
             points discussed in the delegation meeting. Beyond this, I didn't see much new in the
             content of the exchanges which occurred.



             The delegation is convinced that we should resume negotiations with the producers. We
             have responded that you stand by the principles in AGIA and that there may be a role for
             the producers at some point later on.



             I can handle the disagreement on substance. But, even after all these years, I can't
             understand the personal attacks and vehemence of Mr. Halcro and some of his allies.

             John - we have heard Halcro ' s outright lies on other issues , including ACES , MatMaid, his
             own job opportunities with our administration ( where he invited himself in , early on, and
             was even offering to write his own press release announcing his entrance into our Admin -
             until we put a stop to that idea ), my budget comments ( that he had printed in his ADN
             column with " quotes " that I never said ), my personal life, etc.



             If this is another case of Halrco lying , then someone needs to call him on it - including
             mainstream media that , gives him a forum , such as ADN and his new employer KBYR . Even KTUV
             continuing to go to Halcro for counterpoints re: much of what our Admin does. He
             discredits all these media outlets.



             He's gotten away with lies for too long - and if this is another one, he must be called on
             it.

             There were 11 people in the meeting. For the State, they were Marty, Tom, Pat, and Larry.



            Then, there were Senator Stevens and three of his staff :    George Lowe ( Chief of Staff),
            Kate Williams ( Legislative Director ), and Kevin Simpson ( Energy ). Also present were
            Senator Murkowski and two of her staff :   Isaac Edwards ( Legislative Director ) and Chuck
            Kleeschulte ( Energy).



            I can't figure out how Halcro got the information and don't know of any way to check at
            this end . Senator Stevens has always insisted on the confidentiality of such meetings and
            that has been respected by all concerned.



            We've spent part of this morning correcting some inaccurate information that came out of
            the meeting from the Senate side.

             My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
             obviously provided it.  I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
             relationship we hope to have with the delegation.



             In our debrief with the gas team afterwards, we discussed each DC meeting and what, if
             anything, we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
             meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts, and I have requested
             this but have not heard back.



             Senator Stevens is adamant (and probably so is Senator Murkowski). In our collective
             opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform, not cut off communications.

              Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If there
              is activity, it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the only
              game in town, and I believe that the delegation understands that.



             Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
             hopefully that dialogue will help. The next big DC event is FERC's next report to
             Congress on the gasline. Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
             FERC understand the current situation.



             Because of the importance of your question, I'm taking the liberty of adding the Governor
             to our email exchange.



             P.S.

             On a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well. The participants
             were interested and receptive.

             Jan 30: Mr. AGIA goes to Washington



             Last week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update back
             to Alaska's Congressional delegation,

             Witha year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR Deputy
             Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska Senators.

             In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Irwin and
             Rutherford encountered Senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both Stevens and
             Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.

             Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't listen
             last time."

            And, at one point, Stevens'cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
            AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."

            As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
            pipeline.
