              Thanks Patricia - we'll check the old Governors Office press releases to see if there's anything - beyond
              that, travel records would be WAY past their retention requirement. If we don't have a press release I'll
              refer him to the newspapers.

              Linda, we have no records of of Gov Sheffield's 1985 visit to Japan. Will you respond to this gentleman?
              Or should I? Let me know what the next step is if there is one for me.

              Dear Governor Palin,

              As an AMERICAN VETERAN, as a 68 year old AMERICAN senior citizen, I
              am requestingfrom your office, under the Freedom of Information Act, records
              within your archives, that deal with former-Governor Bill Sheffield's visit to Japan.
              I would be only interested in a recorded trip report or a published news story in the
              Anchorage Daily News or another newspaper or a press release of any nature.
              I do know of the exact date ofhis visit only that it had occurred within a few weeks
              before November 4, 1985.

              This request is time critical.
