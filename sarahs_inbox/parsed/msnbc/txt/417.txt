 Subject: An invitation from AK Wild

 Good morning Kari,

 We are very excited here at Alaska Professional Sports to be counting down to the first Intense Football
 League game in Alaska, featuring our AK Wild football team playing against the Frisco Thunder. The first
 game of this inaugural season takes place April 12 at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage.

 I am part of the planning team that is developing the pre-game and half-time shows. We would like to
 invite Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to come to our opening game and to be a part of welcoming
 professional football to the state by playing a key role in the pre-game activities, perhaps even performing
 the coin toss. McHugh Pierre gave me your contact information with the hopes that we could work
 together to make this happen.

 I am unsure of the proper protocol for approaching the Governor for this sort of event. Could you please
 advise me on the right way to submit an invitation, and what I need to provide in order for her office to
 consider our request?

 I would appreciate any help you can lend me.

 Thank you,
