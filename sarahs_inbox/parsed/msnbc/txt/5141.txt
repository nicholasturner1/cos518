                Governor,

                Do you want to go over the Regents applications for a little while today?
                It looks like you almost have it narrowed down , we keep coming back to the same names       Privileged or Personal
               Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


                I'm in the office and can walk over or I'm here via phone or email. And , if Piper wants to go on a walk today I
                bought myself some rain boots.
