          This sounds good - unless I'm missing something, these sentiments reflect my position. Who
          are the senators in opposition?



          After we finalize, Sharon can send this letter to the international reporter who asked
          about this issue on Sunday.

         This is through Mike Tibbles



         Per your request, I have drafted the letter below to Senators Stevens = and Murkowski for
         your consideration.




         Dear Senator -------



         It is my understanding that the US Senate may consider the United = Nations Convention on
         the Law of the Sea in the fall.


                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA_GSP01_0004231

          With this in mind , I am writing to express my strong support for = Senate ratification of
          the Convention .  In my opinion , the Convention = would be beneficial to the US and Alaska
          in various ways , but I want to = focus on one aspect in this correspondence.



          As you know , several Arctic nations have recently asserted claims to = submerged lands off
          their coasts . The Convention on the Law of the = Sea establishes the framework for these
          assertions . To date , 155 = nations , including Canada and Russia , have approved the
          Convention .  = If the US does not ratify the Convention , the opportunity to pursue our =
          own claims to offshore areas in the Arctic Ocean might well be = lost.



          As a consequence , our rightful claims to hydrocarbons, = minerals, and other natural
          resources could be ignored. In this = regard, geologists have prognosticated that
          billions of barrels of crude = oil and vast quantities of natural gas - not to mention
          various hard = rock minerals - might be present in the Arctic, in the absence of =
          affirmative action by the Senate, these resources could become the = property of nations
          with less valid claims.




          It is my understanding that the Bush administration and many = Senators , both Republicans
          and Democrats , have expressed support for = Senate ratification of the Convention.
          However , as you know , = ratification has been thwarted by a small group of Senators who
          are = concerned about the perceived loss of US sovereignty.



          I believe that quite the contrary is the case .   If the US does = not ratify the
          Convention , we will be denied access to the forum establishe = d by the international
          community to adjudicate claims to submerged lands = in the Arctic.



         I also urge that the Congress authorize the programs and funds = necessary for the US to
         assert its sovereign rights . The assertion = of such rights requires significant research
         and information gathering .&nbs= p; Other Arctic nations have recently begun this process,
         and I understand = that the US is moving in this direction as well.



         I believe that you have previously supported Senate ratification of = the Convention.
         With this letter , I want to put my Administration on = record in support of the Convention
         as the predicate for asserting = sovereign rights that will be of benefit to Alaska and
         the nation . = Hopefully , this letter will assist you in articulating Alaska ' s = position
         to your colleagues in the Senate.



         Thank you for considering my views.




         Please note that my email address has = changed . My new email address = is
         <mailto : jwkatz@alaskadc . org> jwkatz@alaskadc . org. = Thank you .
