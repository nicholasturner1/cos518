           Right on!  And it's not just for the convenience of the Administration and the press.
           It's about getting as many Alaskans as possible in on the discussion , and about making it
           easier for bush travelers we heard from who want to be involved , and TransCanada reps, and
           those from AGPA who want to ask the hard questions , and the many federal and Canadian
           representatives who want to challenge or support or just query the Administration's
           findings.  Alaskans deserve that the logistics be easiest on everybody, even producer reps
           headquartered in Anchorage, who are encouraged (again) to participate.   This debate is too
           important to exclude even one person who would have joined but for the cost to fly to
           Juneau.       Great call, Governor.

            Sharon- it's looking like leggies are actually on track to finish up in 90 days, but if we
            have to hold them or call special session to consider AGIA then we have to strategize with
            gasline team on timing of such.



            We were the nice guys last year on location of special session and " suggested " special
            session take place in Anchorage, this time it's obvious they desire more direction so I'll
            be calling it in Anchorage . It's nonsensicle to ask Revenue , DNR, Oil and Gas, Law , press,
            public, etc to fly to Juneau to take care of AGIA this go 'round. It'll be taken care of
            on the more convenient road system.



            So, if asked , that's my answer .- but I do understand we may want to strategize on
            announcing those intentions. Thanks!
