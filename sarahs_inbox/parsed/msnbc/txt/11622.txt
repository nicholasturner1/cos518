              Dear Sarah,

             I am a first time visitor to the Alaka state website. I am truly and deeply, impressed
             with the Governor that the people of Alaska have elected. I would vote for you A MILLION
             times before ANYONE else on the presidential ticket this year. If there is going to be a
             First woman president soon I hope it is you! From what I have read about you on the
             website, you have a well grounded and true respect for the freedoms this country was
             founded on. None of the current candidates seem to understand the meaning of the word
             FREEDOM. I sure wish You would have run for President this year. Maybe in 2012???



             Sincerely,

             Tom Gavlick
