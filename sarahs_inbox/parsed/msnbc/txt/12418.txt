             I will call the producer. I would suggest after the press conference so everything is
             fresh.

             NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams is interested in a one-on-one interview with you
             about Exxon Valdez.

             I suggested right after tomorrow's Exxon Valdez news conference.



             it would be 10- 15 minutes.



             if you would like to do this, Sharon can give the producer a call and make the
             arrangements.
