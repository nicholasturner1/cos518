               You received a letter from me in September stating concerns about several issues , among them the appearance
               of misuse of federal funds . The issue obviously is not at the top of your priority list since I have not received a
               reply nor have further inquiries been sought . After the first of the year, my plan is to share my findings (supported
               with documentation ) with the Anchorage Daily News , so they can investigate the matter.

               You also have not addressed the Sealaska land lease to the group who are alledgely using federal funds for
               personal gain ; and the gate issue.

               You have three issues at hand:
               1. Misuse of federal lands (alledged)
               2. Sealaska land lease to the group misusing federal funds (alledged).
               3. The gate on Sealaska property erected by a non -shareholder.

               These are the three most pressing issues as stated in the letter sent to you in September . There were other
               concerns - but these are the ones I want addressed soon.

              As State Senator , you have the responsibility to address the issue of federal fraud . As Chairman of Sealaska
              Board , you have responsibility to the shareholders.

               Please let me know your plans so that I may plan accordingly.

              Sincerely,

              Tilli G. Abbott
