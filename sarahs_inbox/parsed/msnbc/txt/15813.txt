           All,



           The "City and Borough of Wrangell" formation as the State's eighteenth Borough and is now
           official.



           Wrangell filed its petition April 2006, so this represents two years of technical support
           from DCRA's Local Boundary Commission staff. Congratulations to the LBC section for a job
           well done!



           I especially want to thank Jennie Starkey. Jennie's commitment, talent and experience
           shine everyday, but on this particular project she was simply amazing. Thank You Jennie!
