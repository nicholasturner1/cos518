  Todd,
  Would you like for me to wait until Janice has another scheduling meeting with the Governor?
  Thanks,

  Erika - We only show two requests for the Governor received so far for August 2. We are not into August
  scheduling yet.

  08.02 - Mat -Su - Duck Tape Boat Regatta
  08.02 - Yakutat - Fairweather Day (invited by the Mayor)

 As far as personal scheduling I do not have anything for that date . Thanks, Janice

 Hello Janice,

 The Capital City Celebrations committee has requested to have a Former First Ladies Tea at the
 Governor's House Saturday, August 2nd with Mr. Palin hosting the event. The best date for Todd is
 August 2nd, but he wanted me to check with you to make sure there weren't any scheduling conflicts.
 Not that the Governor would need to be in Juneau, but for him with the kid's if she's out of town.

 Thank you,
 Erika

 I copied one of the emails (below) from Cathie Roemmich as an FYI.

 Email Sent from Cathie Roemmich:

 Dear Erika,

 It's always nice to chat with you on the phone.

 Per our conversation regarding a possible date for a First Ladies Tea, we understand that as of early August the Governor's
 House will be closed for plumbing upgrades and so have chosen July 19 or July 26th as possible dates. If these dates don't
 work for Mr. Palin we would also consider Aug. 2nd.

 Capital City Celebrations is a sub-committee under the umbrella of the Juneau Chamber of Commerce and was organized to
 co ordinate events leading up to and celebrating Alaska's 50th Anniversary.

 As we are new at this we would welcome your advise on invitations, hotel accommodations and air travel requirements. We
 want this to be a very special and historic event for Mr. Palin as well as the past First Ladies.

 Alaska's 50th Anniversary of Statehood will be getting nationwide attention and we hope that having this event documented
 is also acceptable to Mr. Palin.

 Thank you so much for your time and effort on this.

 As always my best to you.

 Cathie
