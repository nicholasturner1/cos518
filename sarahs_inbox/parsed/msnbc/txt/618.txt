2005 was a difficult year for BP; many would say it was the most difficult year in recent memory for the Group.
However, we should all be proud of how BP responded to the tragic events in Texas City and to Hurricanes Katrina &
Rita. Locally, we have many things to be proud of in 2005. We started the year with challenging Safety targets and
showed that we could deliver and build on our success in 2004.         We advanced strategy along a broad front that
includes Viscous, Gas and Fiscal. Finally, our financial results were very strong, largely underpinned by the high price
environment.




2005 Performance
Variable Pay Plan (VPP): The Alaska VPP score for 2005 is 125. This is an outstanding result. A score of 100
provides for full funding of our VPP budget, thus 125 generates a 25% uplift. Actual VPP payouts are dependent upon
an individual's level and performance. VPP Payouts contain two elements: team and individual. The VPP team
element for all Alaska staff is 2/3 of the percentages below while the individual component is performance based.*

Safety: Our 2005 Safety performance was very good : DAFWCF, recordable injury frequency, number of spills and
high potential incidents were generally comparable to the previous year . Notable improvements were seen in the
number of environmental events (opacity and non-opacity) and spill volume - especially gray water spills. The number
of vehicle accidents also improved over the adjusted
2004 figure. Importantly, the Severity of injuries was
less in 2005 than in the previous year. ASAs and
HSE Observations were also close to last years              DAFWCF

Production: We ended the year 14.5mboed net
below our Plan. Needless to say we faced many challenges in 2005 including several equipment failures, integrity
impacts, and major breakthrough events in waterfloodable viscous. The impacts overshadowed success elsewhere
which included excellent results from well work, active reservoir management, and the Northstar drilling program. We
learned a great deal from the challenges we faced early in 2005 and made excellent progress to improving delivery
throughout the year.
Costs: 2005 base lifting costs were $69mm higher than the forecast as a result of additional scope and choices
made, unplanned repairs and overhead. O&M costs were significantly higher than planned. Much of the increase was
due to conscious decisions we made on improving plant integrity and wellwork.

2006 Plan Forward
Alaska strategy for 2006 remains the
same: Focus on the known Resource
Base which includes managing light oil             13
decline and developing the viscous
resource, continue managing costs
through Midstream Transformation &
Renewal     and    continue   working
towards the Bridge to Gas. We have                      0
a challenging plan for 2006 with an
activity set that is well balanced
between long and short term activities.
Our 2006 milestones provide a clear
path towards delivering on our
promises to the Segment Executive
Team.


Enabling Themes - Our strategy is underpinned by several enabling themes that we will focus on in 2006. Each of
these themes addresses risks to delivering this year's plan. One of these enabling themes is technology renewal. BP
Alaska's people have a well deserved reputation as innovators and it is innovation that will drive this part of our
strategy. Technology pull through in 2006 will be the basis for advancing the Endicott LoSal trial, establishing
expertise in Heavy oil and moving forward with the Liberty ERD project. However, the most far reaching theme is
organizational renewal which underpins the importance of people and resources to deliver the Plan. A strategic
workforce plan is in place that will help address this vital issue.




2006 Performance - Our key metrics for success
in 2006 are summarized in the table below. In
terms of safety, it is simple, we want to improve         DAFWCF
upon our 2005 performance and reduce the                  Production (mboed net)

fundamental to our success this year! The production number for 2006 is a realistic target and although we are off to a
slow start this target is clearly achievable. The activity set outlined in the Plan determines our Capital expenditures.
We will be focusing on controlling cost this year as it has become clear that cost creep has entered into our business
during this time of high oil price. With a clear strategy and a clear plan it is up to us to deliver on our promises and
make 2006 an extraordinary year for our Alaska business.
