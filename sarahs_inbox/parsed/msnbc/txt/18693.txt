          Thanks so much Randy - I appreciate this update and look forward to sitting down with you
          on these (and so many other!) issues.



          Right out of the shoot - glad you told me about the mandatory helmet law referenced in DOT
          info. I don't support helmet laws. We'll do all we can to encourage usage, but I won't
          support legislating it. We'll have to communicate that to Leo asap. I believe enough
          states will protest any fed's threat of diminished DOT funds if a state refuses to enact
          helmet laws that Alaska will succeed with those other states on the issue.



          The successes you report on the other fronts, esp with Ketchikan and Muni of Anchorage
          issues, are encouraging.



          Thanks again ,    lots on our plates ,    this will be fun!

          Dear Governor Palin:



          Thank you for the opportunity to work for you. I will try and contribute as quickly as I
          can.



          Just briefly, I have now met personally with all the Commissioners in my portfolio and the
          AG and asked about their issues. I also mentioned the idea from the meeting last week
          with Commissioner Monegan of forming a Criminal Justice Working Group or Commission. I
          think it would be similar to the group formed by Governor Hickel by an Administrative
          Order back in 1993. I have a meeting scheduled for next week to follow up with the Lt.
          Governor.

                                                                 1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0004896

          Also, a few positive things happened last week . The court case against the state related
          to the Anchorage jail and prisoner transport settled out of court by agreement of the
          attorneys . Documents should be filed with the court soon . The municipality and the State
          can now get back to working together.



          DOT and the City of Ketchikan were locked in a nasty dispute over road and utility work on
          the main road in Ketchikan , with DOT threatening to shut down the project if the city did
          not approve payment of another $775 , 000 for change orders .   We managed to get everyone to
          agree to finish the project and sort out who pays later .     The project should be completed
          in another week or 10 days.




          I am working on a Gravina strategy and will meet with Mike again on Monday .     A majority of
          my time so far has been spent meeting with DOT personnel and frankly , trying to find out
          exactly what issues are lying out there , what projects , items , they are working on,
          deadlines for action , and bringing some of them to the attention of the COS. (For
          example, the State's first Highway Safety Plan is due to the feds from the State on Oct.
          1, and DOT ' s draft has some items in it ( mandatory motorcycle helmets , now that will cause
          some controversy and would impact the state budget - a new state highway safety team).




          Sincerely,



          Randy Ruaro
