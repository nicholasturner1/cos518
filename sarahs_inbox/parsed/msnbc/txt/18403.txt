        Since we have been spending so much time on the oil tax, we have not had a chance to
                                                                 1

         discuss the location of the special session . The location will be a big part of the press
         event.     I will need to finalize the proclamation calling the special session for your
         signature.      The outstanding issues are the location, time and content of the session. The
         time is fairly irrelevant.          The wording of the content is important because it can
         restrict the issues taken up during the session .         I will work the language out with Joe
         and Pat. What are you thinking about the location? Privileged or Personal Material Redacted

         I'll feel pretty bad if we cancel on Joe S tomorrow if he needs the weekend to prepare
        for Sept 5 budget mtg, hence he's seeking direction from us tomorrow. Mtg with him and
        Russ is fine with me, we'll just make sure they can keep it concise?
