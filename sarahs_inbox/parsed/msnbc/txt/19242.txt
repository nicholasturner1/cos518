            Hello Governor Palin,




            Just quick note to tell you how happy.I am that a fellow-believer is sitting in the
            governor's seat.  I guess the most important health topic for me is to overturn the
            judicial ruling regarding parental notification for an abortion. Thank you for your
            strong stance on this subject. I pray that it will produce the desired results.



            On another note, congratulations on the birth of your precious little boy! I wanted to
            mention something to you that perhaps you hadn't heard about. There's a major revival
            going on in Lakeland, Florida, with many miracles and healings going on. You can hear the
            fellow who God has anointed so mightily on www.sidroth.org-click on the interview with
            Todd Bentley.



            God bless you and yours.                  In Him,    Mary Tadic
