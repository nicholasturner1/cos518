             Some of these questions have to go through Talis and Barnhill.

             And I don't have Barnhill's email address and can't reach anyone to find it , so please pass this
             email on to him before Sharon returns ADN's call. Thanks

             Governor-

             The Daily News wants to know if we have anything to say about Branchflower . Do you want
             me to say anything new or repeat that you are open to answer any questions?
