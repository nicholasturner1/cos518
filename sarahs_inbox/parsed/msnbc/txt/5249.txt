                  So, what should be done with this, or how did you explain it to him, and did he even re-apply?

                    I wanted to let you guys know that when I spoke with Dr. Warren today he seemed upset he was
                    being removed (we replaced him with Dr. Walther). Dr. Warren said the Lt. Governor told him he
                    would be re -appointed . I don't know the validity of his statement , but waned to give you a heads
                    up incase you hear something.
