         Governor -




        Since we need to get you to New York on Sunday, 10.07. We need to get you back from
        Juneau on Saturday, 10.06 either the 7:20 a.m. - 9:06 a.m. flight or the 1:46 p.m. - 3:32
        p.m. flights (both are none stops JNU/ANC). We can have the family tour the HUB Christian
        Center on Friday afternoon as this was a family invitation. We would not have you attend
        the football game that evening - you will be hosting dinner for them the night before.




        Sunday - Northwest seems to be the best for pricing @ approx. $577.10 w/taxes included.
        Early a.m. departure 9:00 a.m. thru MN arriving
