           Dear Palin Family,

           After reading 250 e-mails on this site there is little I can add in the way of praise or
           encouragement that hasn't already been said .. I am overwhelmed at the support as I am sure
           are you . Working in the health care industry over 36 years I have been blessed to have
           taken care of many children with Down Syndrome . My feeling is that God gave them the extra
           chromosome for a reason . It allows them the tenacity to face the many health problems
           which frequently accompany this syndrome . It is the chromosome of unconditional love,
           forgiveness, generosity , sweetness and kindness . It is the chromosome that allows them to
           look beyond ignorance and prejudice . It is the chromosome that can teach the rest of us
           compassion and understanding if we pay attention . if only this was what we consider
           " normal " what a great world this would be.



           Trig short changed? Not ! Blessed? Most definitely!!!
