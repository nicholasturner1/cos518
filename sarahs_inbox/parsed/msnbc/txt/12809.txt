          There isn't a drop down topic for ethics but there should be.



          As a career government employee ( 35 years ) I'm impressed with seeing you kick butt on
          ethics in government . I hope it's the real deal and not just more b.s.



          I know from experience that the fight for ethical government isn't always fun or
          appreciated.  That doesn't make the journey less important.



          If you're the real deal, I wish you were my governor.
