         Today, for some reason , I'm getting emails at this address that look like they're part of
         some mass gasline lobbying effort... can you track down how folks now have this address?
         It hasnt received mass emails in the past. Thanks

         I would like to know what happen to the "All Alaskan Pipeline"? I am tired of the

         high cost of fuel in Fairbanks and Anchorage pay
