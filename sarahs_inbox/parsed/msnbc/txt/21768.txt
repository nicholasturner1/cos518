              Thanks! And I emailed Mike yesterday re: importance of letting Alaskans kmow we're working
              on plan (and not just reacting to Begich's lawsuit threat), we'll need to message this
              asap . At least letting folks know our intentions. Pls touch base with Mike on that. I do
              think it needs to be soon. Thanks

               Mike: I'd like to begin work on allowing flexibility in CoN for leggies to start
              considering- when does the task force wrap up?



               Also - that ' s a lot of nerve of Begich to say he ' s going to sue over Educ funding when
                                                              1

               Carol Comeau doesn ' t even agree with him. We need to respond with Barbara's and Eddy's
               idea on the three - year , three-legged stool idea . We're going to look reactionary if we
               wait too long to let the public know our educ funding plans, so pls let Eddy know I'd like
               something on the plan to be made public asap. Thanks
