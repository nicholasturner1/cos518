            Nice job governor! Despite the critics, namely halcro, mat-maid closes its books with
            money in the bank and there's still equipment and facilities to sell. Alaskans should know
            YOUR decision to put a new board in place, 600.0 to help w the transition, essentially
            granting an extention to the livelihood of farmers after the previous mngmnt and bd
            decided to abruptly close the doors, etc. Perhaps you have somebody working on this, if
            not I'm happy to send a draft to sharon. Kris, I'm sure, could get some good comments from
            kristan and joey, etc.
