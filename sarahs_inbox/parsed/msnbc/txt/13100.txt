              Governor,

              Fran Ulmer called me; the UAA Men's and Women' s Basketball Teams are NCAA Div II Western Region
              Champs. The men are flying out to Massachusetts and the women to Nebraska . She would like to invite you to
              attend the women 's games in Nebraska. First game is March 26th and - if they make it - the final will be Saturday
              the 290.

              She realizes it is short notice and the timing is bad , but she wanted to extend a personal invitation to you.

              We'll plan on doing a letter for both teams.

              Kris
