                Dear Senators and Representatives,

                I am a member of Zion Lutheran Church, Fairbanks, Alaska. I hope you are concerned about the
                early childhood development/child care crisis in our community. Please read the dialog below.
                Phil Newton is the President of our congregation and Lenetta Colbert is the Executive Director
                of Open Arms, Zion's early childhood development mission.

                Our State, with its immense riches, needs to help those least able to help themselves . A State
                that can spend 10's of millions of dollars for a Fairbanks fish hatchery ought to be able to care for
                its youngest citizens.

                Thank you,
                William L. Slayden

                  Good afternoon Pastor, Lenetta and Julie,

                  Play & Learn West has announced that they will close next month . This will create a shortage in child
                  care in Fairbanks. That shortage will have to be filled in some way.

                  Is this an opportunity for Open Arms to expand? If so, could it lead to an opportunity for a church plant?

                  I know these are big questions. Should we explore?

                  God's peace,

                  Phil

                  Good Afternoon Phil:

                  I have thought long and hard about your question. Hear are some of the thoughts I have at this time.
                  Please note they are my own opinions and have not been discussed formally with the Open Arms Board
                  or with either Pastor Joe or Pastor Kuehnert.

                  First of all, Open Arms is THE center in town. With the closures of Educare last spring, Play & Learn
                  East in August and now Play & Learn West, parents have few choices for center-based care. In
                  conversations with Cheryl Keepers at the Child Care Assistance Office, she notes that there are about
                  4400 children under age 6 in need of care in the borough. However, there are only 2200 licensed child
                  care slots. Is this an opportunity for Open Arms to expand?

                 My first reaction is to say an informed "No". In conversations with Gara Bridwell, Executive Director of
                 Play & Learn, and with the former Director of Educare, the story is always the same: Centers lose money
                 because parents can't afford the true cost of care. To compensate for this centers do not pay their staff
                 well. Staff turnover is high (432 in 2.5 years for Open Arms) and the quality of care and education for our
                 very important young children suffers. And just in case we have forgotten, this is the age when a child's
                 brain grows the most, and when certain windows of learning open and close, never to be "re-learned" in
                 quite the same way. We have certain scientific evidence ( PET scans ) which proves this to even the most
                 skeptical person. Christ is brilliant-he created all of these young children and knew for certain that they
                 were the most important in His kingdom! Solid research by several different firms shows the huge return
                 on each dollar spent on quality early childhood education-an average of $7!! It is definitely "patient
                 capital", but an investment that clearly saves taxpayers down the road in remedial costs for education,
                 the penal system, etc., not to mention the positive impact on our future community.

                 I have been in the early childhood profession for 30+ years. The story hasn' t changed . Society in
                 general sees child care as a family responsibility and not a societal concern. Without debating the
                 reasons children are in childcare, the number of children in care has only increased during this time.
                 These young children grow up without quality care and education in their youngest and most formative
                 years and become the people who will take care of us, teach our grandchildren and run our country.
                 Whether or not you believe young children should be in child care is really a moot point, because they are

                  and will continue to be. The cost of providing care will continue to climb as standards for teaching staff
                  are raised. How will Centers be able to continue to provide care? How will Open Arms be able to survive,
                  let alone expand? As you are aware, we currently struggle to make ends meet and are dependent on
                  church assistance of $14,000 per year and fundraising dollars of $50,000 per year.

                  I am aware that one of the mission goals for Zion is to add satellite centers in the borough . Now seems
                  like a good time? If we are indeed serious about the expansion , I would suggest the following:

                     1. A special committee be appointed to look at the possibility of expanding. They would need to
                        consider financing, staffing and location.
                          This committee should include members from the business community, early childhood
                          community, and from both the Open Arms Board and Leadership Council. I would suggest a
                          meeting with Gara Bridwell as well.
                     2. Setting up a separate training unit for staff as part of Open Arms. This would be a unit that runs
                        year around and whose sole purpose would be to train new and current staff. By setting up our
                        own training we could by pass the need for our teacher assistants to obtain degrees . This would
                        be similar to what the military does.
                     3. Increasing the rates to pay for the actual cost of care in all facilities , but offering significant
                        scholarships for low income families who qualify for state assistance.
                     4. Conducting a demographic study to see if our community could support both expansion and an
                        increase in rates-in some cases almost double the current rates.

                  Finally, I know that our God is a God of the impossible . He has proven over and over again to me
                  personally and to the Zion congregation . I would suggest that much prayer and study go into any thought
                  of expansion.

                  I would also welcome your thoughts as to other possibilities for expansion or items to consider.

                  Joy in the Great Teacher! lenetta
