       My Prlvile ed will be having Privileged or Personal surgery this Friday, October 12 here in
       Juneau.      would like to be at the hospital with her during this time. I will have the
       laptop and available by email and cell. We will know on Thursday at her pre-op what time
       on Friday her surgery will be. I will then let you know if I will be out in the a.m. or
       the afternoon.    Thank you, Janice
