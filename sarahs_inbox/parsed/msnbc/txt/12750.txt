           My understanding is its only 10 min needed from me on the doc, so pls sched for 10 min
           before the reception... then I don't have to wait around between the doc interview and the
           reception thanks

            Okay.       I was very clear and told Cliff that you might but it was not

            definite.      They do not expect you for an hour; that was the time they

            gave me as optimal for a stop-by.



            Sharon said you agreed to do the documentary, so if there is no

            objection; I'll proceed with scheduling that for approximately 3pm at

            the Ice Park. I assume Sharon will take care of Daily News Miner.



            I have a folder with maps, program, etc. for tomorrow. Most of it was

            for ease and convenience.          There is no expectation for speech, only a

            "welcome to Alaska", at the reception.

            For tomorrow in Fairbanks:



            The Governor plans to stop in at BOG between 10am - 11am at Pikes.




            I'm going to call the documentary place you gave me and see if they can

            do tomorrow around 3pm at the Ice Park.



            The Governor' s International Reception is at 4pm . Her plane departs at

            6:46 pm.



            Note : there is an international luncheon at 12 : 30 pm that I will be

            attending .    There is no expectation that the Governor will be present.

            This will be a casual affair, in the middle of their bus tour of

            Fairbanks.
