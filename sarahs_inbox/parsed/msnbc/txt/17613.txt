         Tib: would you find for me the fiscal impacts on budget as we fight for the $48 mil Muni
         Rev Share - how it fits in with our proposed PERSTRS contribution. We'll be asked about
         it, no doubt, in tomorrow's press conf. We'll be asked if this 48 mil takes the place of a
         portion of the PERS contribution, or can we afford this IN ADDITION to PERS fix.
