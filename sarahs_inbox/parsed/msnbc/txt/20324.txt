          How long does the teachers ' merit pay pilot program last? We inherited

          it from last admin, my understanding is it goes away and we can figure

          out something better on our own watch once the pilot program ends? There

          may need to be some clarification on the issue and the program ' s intent

          (based on emails I'm getting re: whatever was printed in the ADN on the

          issue today - I haven't read the article yet).
