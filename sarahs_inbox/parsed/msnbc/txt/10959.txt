             Sounds like there ' s only the interim aidea director on board- she knows she ' s there very
             temporarily until a Coordinator of all energy policy be hired . Priyileae ltold Mike he may
             be interested in the "Czar " position in the future , but, not now.



             Is there another single person to consider who'd fit the role of Energy Coordinator, or is
             this worthy of sdtatewide public recruitment?

             Governor,   based on the foundation that there would be a director over AIDEA and one over
                                                               Redacte be interviewed for the Energy position.

              Do you recommend a public recruitment of Energy Coordinator candidates - or does anyone
             have a person in mind?
