              You are performing at a very high level on behalf of your fellow Alaskans and we know it. Don't

              will have us be in fact we aren't dumb at all. I will continue to pray for you and your family.
              Count me thankful that my Governor has a strong backbone to go along with her high morals.

              Kate- there's a great "First Ladies" video that was released two years ago. It gives the history and great
              perspective re: why we're hosting these events on Saturday. Pis watch that to help you craft message on
              the historical event(s). Thanks

              R- If there are points you can be thinking about while traveling today pis plan on incorporating them
              into the presser, III ask Kris to find a Statehood person (or other capable writers such as Patricia or
              someone) and this can all be put together if, not today then tomorrow. Sharon is slammed so I won't be
              asking her to do this one... pls let me know if you have other ideas on who can help craft this, including
              getting a quote or two from participants like the former House Manager and/or other First Ladies like
              Bella Hammond (whomever is easy to reach). Kate can assist on this- she's a great writer and
              researcher... I'll cc her in. She can contact the current House Manager, Erika, and go from there.

               Hi R- the events this Saturday at the Gov 's House, as hosted by the First Family, are historic. We do not believe they've ever
               been done before as Todd gathers former First Ladies for their tea.., plus we invited former First Ladies and their (grown)
               children to revisit the mansion for the Statehood Celebration.
               Alaskans would like to know of this, I'm sure, so profiling it and/or allowing a photo op of these wonderful elderly Alaskan
              women as they gather here on Saturday would be great for historical reasons and for today 's public to witness.
                Statehood celebration folks can shed more light on this and help you write a presser on it, as can historians in Juneau who
              can appreciate this unprecedented event ... and please remind Alaskans that it is a pleasure and honor for the current First
              Family to host this. We'll all be here except our son who is away training in the Mojave Desert with his Styker Brigade before
              their Sept deployment to Iraq.
                An ironic mention needs to include the fact that Todd will have just returned from his blue collar Slope job to host the First
              Ladies Tea. (Humor helps in these type of announcements). Thanks!
               (Kris, if u think of others who can help contribute to this presser pls let Rosanne know so it can be cranked out today, then
              press can follow up.)
