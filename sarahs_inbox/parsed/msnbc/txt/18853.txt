          I would hesitate and maybe Mike and I could discuss                before you call... if you call.

           Did leg liason office talk to him then conclude he has all the info he's be requesting,
          so i should call him? I just dont want to make cold calls that will tick off stedman and
          others if they're desiring info that isnt at my fingertips.



           Let me know if they say this is a call i should make
