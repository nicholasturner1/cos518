          I was there as was Sharon and Nizich. I recall the "now is not the time or place." And no
          specific mention that an endorsement would be forthcoming.

          Never said anything about a done-deal forthcoming endoresment. I'll ask Sharon to check on
          what Balding think she heard- pls give Sharon details so she can check. I said weeks ago
          "this isn't the time" in a Federal Bldg to endorse a candidate. Those who were with me at
          the event heard it. Can't remember who was with me.

          don't know if you caught ktuu tonight but while i was driving i heard baldino quote you
          from ted's energy press conference where you said an endorsement would be forth coming.
          don't know how you navigate this, but the press will pick up on it and try to further
          shove a wedge between you and ted. just wanted you to be aware.

              Governor,

              Considering the schedule of the senate majority caucus (10:00 am) and then the cabinet meeting (11:00 am), we
              recommend that you block out the 1:00 hour to make impromptu visits to the following members:

              Lyman Hoffman
              Bert Stedman
              Donny Olson
              Lesil McGuire
              Charlie Huggins
              Lyda Green

              We could potentially get it started earlier if you excuse yourself from lunch a little bit early.

              The message doesn't need to be complex, just direct and to the point that Alaskans deserve a vote and it needs to
              move out of committee today.

              We could have Janice make calls to the offices shortly before you head up to the respective offices (if you look at
              the list, you would start on the 5th Floor and then proceed down to the 1st Floor).

              Let us know what you think about this plan.

              Joe

             Governor -

             CNBC would like to interview you again about oil drilling and Senator Stevens. Since Juneau
             does not have the technology to beam live video to the east coast - CNBC would fly a techie
             from Channel 2 with portable equipment. Please let me know if you would like to pursue
             this.
