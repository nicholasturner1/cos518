               Subject: Criminal Justice Reform

             Hollis French was in touch. (After he was chewed out by Chief Huehn for jumping out there
             with a crime summit .) Says he wants to collaborate with us on a criminal justice package (his is
             an urban gang focus , I believe). He says that he doesn 't intend his hearing in November to be
             a headhunting affair or to place blame ...just wants to explore what's working , and what's not.
             We'll see.

             In any event , he says he wants to do coffee in a week or two when he returns from taking his
             son to college. I'll keep you posted.
