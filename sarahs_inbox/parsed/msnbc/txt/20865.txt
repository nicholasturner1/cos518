                                          Alaska Air National Guard rescues 16

              September 17, 2008, Juneau , Alaska - Twenty -six members of the Alaska Air National Guard are
              returning home today after deploying in support of hurricanes Gustav, Hannah and Ike in the Gulf
              Coast region.

              Responding to a request from the states of Louisiana and Texas , the Alaska Air National Guard's
              176th Wing deployed two HH -60 Pave Hawk helicopters and airmen on September 1 to support
              search-and-rescue efforts.

             "This mission was a true testament to the training and capabilities of our Alaska Air National
             Guardsmen," Governor Palm said . "I was pleased to be able to direct our Alaska National
             Guardsmen to deploy to the Gulf Coast region and support the citizens of those states in a critical
             time of need."

             The Alaska Air National Guard deployed under the auspices of the Emergency Management
             Assistance Compact, a program that allows guard units to mobilize upon request to render
             assistance to other states.

               (Alaska) Craig E. Campbell, adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard." "We perform these
               missions everyday here in Alaska and that's why the governors of Louisiana and Texas requested
               support from Gov. Sarah Palin. When you want the best, you ask for the best, and the Alaska Air
               National Guard is world-renowned for having the experience and professionalism to perform in the
               harshest conditions."

               Alaska is one of several state Guard organizations that rendered assistance to the Gustav, Hannah
               and Ike impact zone.

               Members of the 176th Wing flew 22 missions and were awarded 16 saves during their 16-day
               deployment to the Gulf Coast region.
