              I just received an email saying that my message/response that I sent an

              hour ago was "undeliverable"...       Hope this time it works!



             K has volleyball, but Brent could get her to the capitol by 4:30pm. to

             pick up Piper. If you want Pip to walk home before that Tom & I could

             monitor her walking via the sec. cameras and she could hang out at the

             House until K gets here.
