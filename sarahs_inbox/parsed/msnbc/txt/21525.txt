              Crap ivy - this is exactly what I've assumed. Bitney continues to bad mouth this admin,
              and ever since he's been gone the b.s. rhetoric that ends up in the 'ear, or on blogs,
              increased 10-fold. Many others tell me it's Bit and Clark who stirstuff up any chance they
              get. I passed on this latest to two who can sure sympathize - and will agree that Bit's
              and Clark's comments are ridiculous and only meant to hurt- and to create division between
              you and me and others in admin.



              Thanks for letting me know of this. I'm sorry you had to hear any snide garbage sentiments
              aimed at you from these guys.

              I think all rumors come back to John Bitney! It's a shame. I just wanted you to see the
              stuff that is regurgitated out there. He has no right to say anything about Mike, Frank,
              me or any others.
