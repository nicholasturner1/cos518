                 Subject: Arctic Power - For what its worth

               Dave Donaldson with APRN contacted Adrian Herrara at Arctic Power. He was interested in doing a
               "correction" story about G. Gordon Liddy/ Arctic Power funds. Apparently, Adrian was very rude to
               him and refused comment. I realize that Liddy has canceled the trip - this is just an FYI.

              Mr. Thomson,

              As the webmaster for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's office I'm writing to address your
              concern over navigation on our http://www.cov.state.ak.us page.

              For future notice, the first item on the top yellow bar of every state agency page is a

              quarter of the Alaska State Seal                  which will always take you to the State of Alaska web
              portal (http://www.alaska.gov).

              On the Governor's website specifically, I've also put a link back to the State of Alaska
              web portal in the footer of every page (at the bottom, first link titled "State of
              Alaska").

              As the hub of online state resource... the State of Alaska web portal has various ways to
              find departmental links in several places. It is always our effort to make it easier for
              folks to quickly find online state resources and I am saving your email for future
              revisions to the Governor's website.

              Thank you for your input!

              Kind Regards-
              Andy Mills
              Office of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin

              MESSAGE:
              I find it difficult if impossible to find a link to state agencies from the Governor's web
              site.
