                Dear Rep. Joule,
                Swimming skills save lives.
                All three of my children have learned to swim in public pools. Without access to these facilities , my family
                would not be as safe on Alaska waters. We simply cannot afford an athletic club membership and do not
                have access to military base pools. Alaska has three times the national drowning rate . Please don't let
                Alaska's children and future adults add to this tragic statistic.
                Also, Bartlett Pool is the only 50-meter competitive pool in the state. Swimmers from all over Alaska travel
                to Anchorage to swim in this unique venue. Public pools are a state asset. It would be a colossal waste
                not to maintain the facilities that so greatly enhance our quality of life in this wonderful state.
                Please appropriate funds to match the Anchorage Pool Bond.
                Sincerely,
                Marcia Harmening
