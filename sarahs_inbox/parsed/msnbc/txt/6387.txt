         Thanks so much John. Glad we'll have this opportunity to work formally with NGA on those
         priorities so important to AK that you've outlined in your email - especially energy
         policy.



         I look forward to future reports on our new role in NGA, and I appreciate your work in
         getting me the gig as vice chair of the committee.



         Also, Kris will contact you soon regarding your DC office's role in the PPT special
         session that I shall call - to be held in October.



         Thanks!

        development as an essential element of national energy policy. = The NGA does not deal
