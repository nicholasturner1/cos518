          Subject :                 interview and special session


         Pls tell ktuu that I'm in juneau now, working with revenue and natural resources so i'll
         be able to announce my intention to call sp session by tomorrow (friday) to revisit the
         legislature's decision to adpot ppt. I'll make that announcement from juneau. And it's
         still my intention to allow as many Alaskans as possible to participate in this all
         important issue, hence my desire to see the legislature meet on the road system to address
         ppt. The best time to do this is in October. By the way - "Alaska Day" is October 18.
         Quite fitting for elected officials to convene on that day.

         Subject: interview and special session




         Ralph Thomas with the Seattle Times would like a 5 minute phone interview with you today
         or tomorrow regarding investigations.  He read the Steve Quinn article and would like to
         ask questions along those lines.



         This reporter met you during the campaign. ( 360) 236-8266



         Also- is there anything I can give to Channel 2 regarding the special session in advance
         of the announcement? Maybe something like - the special session will likely be in
         October..-..or likely be on the road system. A little hint goes a long way.




         Thanks




         Sharon Leighow
