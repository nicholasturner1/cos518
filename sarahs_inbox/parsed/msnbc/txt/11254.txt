             Wow- this is great! And no comments? Meaning no protests to royalty agreement - that's
             good to know, for when Halcro and crew gripe that we had to "buy" them to develop.



             Excellent news and thanks so much for great work on getting this project moving.

             ENI just let us know that they have sanctioned the Nikaitchuk project. This includes new
             facilities and aprox. $1.5 Billion investment.  They have asked that we keep it
             confidential until they can get their press release out - probably tomorrow.



              Remember DNR evaluated this project and granted royalty relief based on technical and
             commercial information . We received " no" comments during the public comment period.



              Hope you are having a good trip. God bless. Tom
