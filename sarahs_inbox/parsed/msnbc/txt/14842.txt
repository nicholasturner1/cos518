           Dear Gov. Palin,

           Do you know this song by Natalie Merchant? You can watch it on YouTube. I think it will
           have special meaning to you. Thank you and best of luck and congratulations on your new
           baby.



           Wonder

           Doctors have come from distant cities,         just to see me

           Stand over my bed, disbelieving what they' re seeing



           1-They say I must be one of the wonders

           Of God's own creation

           And as far as they see, they can offer

           No explanation
                                                                 1

           Newspapers ask intimate questions , want confessions

           They reach into my head to steal , the glory of my story

            (repeat 1)



           Ooo, I believe ,   fate ,   fate smiled

           And destiny laughed as she came to my cradle

           Know this child will be able

           Laughed as my body she lifted

           Know this child will be gifted

           With love , with patience , and with faith

           She'll make her way, she ' ll make her way



           People see me I'm a challenge to your balance

           I'm over your heads how I confound you

           And astound you

           To know I must be one of the wonders

            (rpt...1)



           Ooo, I believe , fate, fate smiled

           And destiny laughed as she came to my cradle

           Know this child will be able

           Laughed as she came to my mother

           Know this child will not suffer

           Laughed as my body she lifted

           Know this child will be gifted

           With love , with patience and with faith

           She'll make her way, she ' ll make her way
