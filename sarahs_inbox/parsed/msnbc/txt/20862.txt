        Sarah I was at lebanon.ohio.I know alot has happened quickly for you so i'll try to jog
        your memory..You were greeting on the street and i came up to you i have a labrette in my
        face aand earrings and i said I'm praying for you-I'm male 44 (Your Age;) You said "we
        are praying for you too.."I looked very unrepublican..lol but I'm conservative and
        republican-But anyway renew your strength and come out swinging..God has called you to
        this position that's why it was such a simple yes.You are needed to bring America out of
        the blindness that's over it and the Spirit that is controlling it-There is a prayer
        militia that's holding you up now! Roar like a lion in the presence of your enemies and
        those who would lie against you..Be confident in his strength because he will give you the
        words to say when you need them and he will guide your steps..I believe your vp position
        with bring financial blessing over America and a spiritual revival here too..I never

         realised that Mccain was God's man         until recently-God's been working on his heart and
        I'm proud of him..You will go out in        battle with John Mccain with Deborah's mantle on
        you-Stay in prayer in your times of         quiet and God Will raise you up ...I'm sending you
        some pics from the rally ..You hubby        is in some..

        Love you in Christ,

        Joel Crouch
