            Shoot I thought this was any time between 28th-31st. I'll figure something out later I
            guess.

            Governor - Just talked with Frank Hobbs (Chili's). Unfortunately they are not serving
            dinner this evening. They do have available Saturday Lunch or Dinner and Sunday Lunch or
            Dinner.  If this weekend does not work then when you are in the Valley they will
            accommodate you and the first family. Janice

            J- tonight looks to be the only night we can get to Chili' s in Wasilla . Can you hook that
            up? (I think there would be four of us anyway available from the family)
