             It's imperative that we speak to Alaskans' questions today re: DPS. Please trust me that
             the best path forward, in fairness to the public and consistent with an open government
             without anything to hide, is for me to be freed up to speak - especially now that Walt has
             chosen to speak erroneously about his dismissal.

                Sharon, instead of staffing the picnic today, please cont to work with Randy, Annette,
             Karen, Mike, and others, on contacting press/public with messaging that proves I have
             nothing to hide; proves the legitimate reasons for the need to go in a better direction w
             DPS; proves this had nothing to do with Wooten, etc.

                I desire to speak to the public on this. I've never gone the "no comment" route before
             and I won't do it now. Again, circumstances have changed in the way this issue is to be
             handled because our assumption that Walt would not like public discussion of his
             leadership was wrong, he's obviously chosen to publicly air (through the union, evidently)
             his false allegations.

                Also, law makers are insistent in hearing more. No fear of their proposed
             investigation, but I'd rather save them time and resources and go directly to them and the
             public on a much more transparent path re: this issue.

                Sharon- pls let reporters know (assuming they show up at the Anchorage picnic as they
             did at the Wasilla picnic) that I desire to speak for myself on this issue and, again,
             have nothing to hide.

                 Randy and Karen are working on summary re: budget increases we proposed (versus dps
             claim last night that WE cut it so drastically that troopers won't be paid their
             overtime); vacant positions w no action to recruit; battle over the word "integrity" we
                                                                    1

           desired in his contract negotiations that he did not want included (Annette- pls provide
           more details on that for Randy ); false allegations that I or anyone else pressured him to
           fire Wooten ( even falsely accusing folks of even discussing the issue with him); etc,
           including many other issues.

             Please let me know where folks are able to contribute in this effort . Randy and Mike
           will be centerpoint on this today as I'm meetin ' and greetin ' Alaskans at the picnic.
           They'll be working with Sharon to allow me more pro -active contact with the media today on
           this.

              Also - Kelly, we're more than happy to speak with Hollis on this, he seems to be the
           spokesperson for leggies on this.

    t     Reading the comment in ADN today is disturbing re: "refusal " to speak about Walt, even if
          leggies ask.

            1) I am not hesitant to speak, but have tried . to respect Walt's assumed desire for zero
          public scrutiny (but look where that's getting us ), thus we've left it with a general
          message of the change at DPS. That must be better explained . I'd stand up in a second and
          explain his dismissal if my explanations thus far are not sufficient ( ie, recruitment,
          bootlegging that Walt could have focused on with his new job offer he turned down, more
          energy and action needed in DPS half -way through the term be there ' s not a lot of time
          left to make a difference , etc). My belief has been that Walt would NOT have wanted me to
          talk publicly about his dismissal.

             2) We can never say we'd not talk about this , "no matter who asks" .   If leggies ask via
          an investigation , of course we speak . In fact , if leggies ask via any venue, of course we
          speak and give them the reasons . Walt obviously doesn't mind the public discussion at this
          point, and his untruths must be countered at the same time . This is imperative or Kopp
          will NOT have the support of the dept and will NOT be given the opportunity to succeed as
          commissioner.

             So this perception needs to be cleared up asap - I do not fear any investigation - but
          it would be used as a distraction , obviously , and is not needed if we're just given the
          opportunity to lay to rest any speculation spurred by leggies , Walt , the union , critics,
          or whomever is stirring this.

              I do appreciate the adn reported the fact that we INCREASED dps budget - leggies cut it
          (glad they got that right finally! ), as opposed to the union leadership on ktva last night
          insisting that we cut their budget $2.5 million, and the reporter not challeneging that at
          all!

                I am happy to more publicly address all of this be it would run counter to "open
            govt" now that Walt has spoken untruthfully about the Wooten issue ( esp claims that Todd
            met w him more than once, Annette ' s and Frank ' s alleged meetings , my alleged February
            discussion with Walt, all of our " pressure ", etc.)

            Janice - pls look on sched to see if I met with Walt in Februrary , on Hoffman " s birthday.
            Walt claims I walked with him to wish Hoffman happy bday- and supposedly talked about
            Wooten on that walk ( evidently "pressuring" him?)
