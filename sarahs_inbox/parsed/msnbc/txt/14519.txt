            Yep- not good. Let me know if anyone changes his mind. Wonder why he'd choose to pull
            this.

            Governor,

           Yes we heard this yesterday and both Joe and Tom are reaching out to Speaker Harris in an
           effort to change his mind. We are very concerned about the position Harris is taking.

            Marty

           What? This is so odd. Did you let AGIA team know? I'm going to forward to them so they
           know what to prepare for

           Governor-




           Speaker Harris emailed all House members:



           Since the same information will be offered in Juneau during our special session in early
           June, I will not be reimbursing any member or staff for travel or per diem to Anchorage
           for the Governor's briefing on AGIA. If you want to attend you certainly can do so, but I
           will not reimburse you for any expenses you incur.



           Steve Quinn is the only member of the media who has called on this. Joe Balash is
           responding saying - it is important to the Governor that we have these briefings on the
           road system so the public can participate. We understand that not every lawmaker will be
           available to attend but we certainly encourage them to take advantage of this opportunity.
            We are hearing from some lawmakers that they will be attending on their own dime. The
           information will be presented in a fashion unlike a committee hearing in Juneau.
