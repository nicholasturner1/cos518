             Madam Governor;




             Juneau's power situation.   Almost everyone I know is taking quite extensive measures to
             save/conserve.   Regardless, many of us live in all electric housing situations. Many of
             us don't have a lot of expendable income. The argument that others are using not to help
             us out is .......... "Get used to it, many other places in Alaska already pay high electric
             bills!" ....... problem is, this is a small natural disaster and not a foreseen item to
             budget for, this is not something we have built into our income/expenditure models!



             Please support Juneau residents in finding some relief to the expected high costs over the
             next several months.   Juneau isn't immune to economic troubles and rising costs, not to
             mention small disasters.



             Sincerely, Cory Heimbuch Juneau, AK
