        I think it best if I do. The answer will be off to him just as soon as I'm done with my
        800 appt.

        FYI.  This guy has sent me a couple of notes in the last two weeks.. .he obviously likes
        JVT, but I am concerned about the line about helping 5 farmers. We need to make sure our
        message today includes the destanilizing effect the elimination of the dairy segment will
        have on the overall agricultural industry... not to mention the 100+ jobs at the creamery.

         Joe,

         I'm a little worried about the way the Governor is handling this mat Maid thing. I still
        have a lot of faith in her and her ideas. But I believe that maybe she isn't getting the
        whole picture on this dairy business.

        Dairy nation wide has been supported by government for many decades. Now with the ethanol
       growth the price of feed is going to put a squeeze on even the best run dairy's in lower
       48. Joe Van Treeck is a very capable and honorable man. He has already done miracles
       keeping mat Maid operating for last 25 years.. He took a lot of heat early on by importing
       milk to keep production up. Through out the years he has introduce many innovative
       products to keep the dairy diversified. I do believe that if Joe Van Treeck can't keep Mat
       Maid going then no one can. My point is I don't want to see Sarah get into something which
                                                         2




                                                                                                    PRA GSP01_0002618

        will backfire and haunt her for the rest of her administration . Although she is quite
        committed publicly almost Frank like . I do not believe that the dairy can once again
        operate without lots of government dollars . If   she goes and puts 2 - 3 million dollars into
        to save livelihood of 4 or 5 farmers it will not set very well with a lot of people in
        the state . Also by axing board members that aren ' t yes men she puts other state directors
        into the position of maybe not being quite candid enough so as not to lose their jobs. I
        don't really believe in the my way or highway approach when you are dealing with
        knowledgeable people . You end up with too many yes men and too many failed projects.
