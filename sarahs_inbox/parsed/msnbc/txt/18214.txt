            The Governor is also having problems sending and receiving on her blackberry. I've notified Kami in Juneau for
            corrective action.

            Governor Palin -

           Meg's email is down for the moment. We wanted to give you a heads up about Channel 2 . Not sure
           how they found out about your schedule, but Rebecca Palsha will be waiting outside of Nine Star
           this afternoon . She is interested in what's next for Mat Maid from the state 's perspective.
