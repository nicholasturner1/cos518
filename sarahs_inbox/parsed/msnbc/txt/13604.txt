            Let me know when you do, be he needs to be bombarded by you guys, Mike, me if necessary,
            etc... to make sure he understands the politics and diversionary tactics the critics are
            using him for. I'll be there. And I haven't even seen the email, but I assume it didn't
            say to call senators and tell them how to vote? Also, what's the difference between this
            type of communication outreach and calling a press conf to outreach to constituents to let
            them know what bills are balled up in the Senate?

             Amazing out of all the shenanigans being pulled by lawmakers that he spun this up as a
            "wrong" on admin's part. Unapologetic is our stance, as there is nothing to hide from the
            public on our part, and critics should be asking what is it that any lawmaker is afraid of
            the public knowing... hence their outrage that information was revealed to Alaskans.



             Comm Dept can catch this one if it looks like Wesley will follow through on his threat to
                                                                  1

             The guy was a real jerk and Heather Brakes as a witness was outraged.

             It was 9:00 PM and I was working on trying to get a couple of things out

             of the Senate and he interrupted and asked a question about sending

             emails .    I told him it was appropriate and the administration contacts

             Alaskans all the time about issues that impact them .        He asked a

             question about databases and I told him I would talk to him in the

             morning .   He acted like he had a gotcha, was very aggressive and he was

             threatening a front page story.



             We will get more information to him right away. I just talked to Nizich

             and he is working with the press office.



             Mike

             Mike- Wesley reported you had a "no comment" comment re: his question

             last night re: 30,000 biz lic addresses used to notify on biz lic fee

             legislation. Did you talk to him yet this morning to follow up? (He

             reported that you told him you'd be happy to talk to him in the morning

             about it.). The accusation is there was a violation of state email

             policy with the activity. He'll need clarification asap before that

             issue gets even more spun up. Pls let me know what Wesley's response

             was/is after you talk to him.
