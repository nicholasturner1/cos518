          Thanks so much Tom. My prayer for us and the state is that God has His way here. That we
          don't miss His will and that we are given the wisdom, the strength and the favor to let
          Him work through us. Also, that the right people are put in place to usher in that will.
          Thank you for the Isaiah reminder!

              He has richly blessed us and our endeavors. Thank you Tom.

          Governor,

            I met with Senator Dyson today. It was a real blessing and encouragement to me. God
           knew that I needed Fred's visit. Fred prayed for both of us, and reminded me that we are
           a part of God's plan.



            I want to provide that same encouragement and blessing to you. Tonight Sharon and I
           again prayed that God would bless you richly as Governor and the he would bless you and
           your family beyond measure.

            I really praise God for you.



            God's promise:

            Isaiah 41:10 (NIV)

               I will strengthen you and help you. I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.
