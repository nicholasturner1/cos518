          Sharon- any idea why Shelia has referenced twice now "the nasty letter Sarah wrote to
          Lyda" (she's refering to the letter Tibbles and Balash wrote to her on April 18, 1
          presume)? What was perceived as so nasty about it I wonder?



          I did ask the guys if they wanted to put their name on it when they presented it to me for
          my signature - of course they wouldn't - but the last few communications from the guys to
          Lyda, with my signature, sure have been capitalized upon by Shelia. Guess this is a lesson
          that the letters could have been tweaked more - but any idea why Shelia perceives them as
          she has?
