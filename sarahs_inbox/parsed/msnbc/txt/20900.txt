          Governor - I assume either Tom or Fred would accompany you. I would be happy to go also
          if you would like. Janice

         J- i feel obligated to that coach to "coach" his team, as we already committed to it and
         it helped justify my trip back down to Juneau this week. I hate to back out unless there's
         absolutely no other way.



          Is security going, if so -who?
