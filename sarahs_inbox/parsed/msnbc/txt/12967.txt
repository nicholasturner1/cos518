              Done deal.   Talked with Gary this morning. Dan Rohrer will pick us up, take us to the
              debate, then drop us back off immediately after. You've met Dan at Kodiak Chamber of
              commerce and his parents Dick and Sue Rohrer, good solid small business owner...no
              controversy.

              Frank- if u can find someone already in Kodiak to pick us up at airport (or we could take
              a cab ), let me know so security doesn't have to travel early in order to get us to the
              school for the two-hr event... I talked to Gary about that this morning. Thanks. It'll be
