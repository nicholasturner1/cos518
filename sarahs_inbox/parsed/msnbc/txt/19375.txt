          From Kyle Hopkins in Anchorage --




          A criminal case just appeared in federal court:



          USA v. John Cowdery



         Legislators are gathered in Juneau for a special session on a possible natural gas
         pipeline. Cowdery was at the hearing Wednesday but hasn't appeared this morning. His
         office is dark and locked, but so are a lot of other legislative offices. Not all
         lawmakers brought staff members to the special session.
