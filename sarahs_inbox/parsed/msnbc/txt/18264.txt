          Dear Mr. Anderson:




          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

          Governor

        Thank you, thank you, thank you.



        For making all the cuts in the budget. It's about time someone is using their head and
        thinking about the future.  As a 3rd generation and 72 years old, all I have seen in the
        last 20 years is spend, spend, spend. As soon as there is a surplus spend it, even on
        projects that we do not need.



        Thank you again,
