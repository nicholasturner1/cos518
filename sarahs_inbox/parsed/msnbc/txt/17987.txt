        Let me know if the First Family is invited to any Juneau events this summer and we can get
        the kids back - otherwise I'll plan on them being in SouthCentral. We're headed to airport
        - Piper's with me, I'll bring Agia with me next time - she can hang out at the house and I
        asked Ivy to check on her at night.



        Also - I do need to know when the mansion work will take place so I can finalize summer
        schedules around that.



        Thanks! Hopefully there will be a few First Family events for Piper and Willow, at least,
        to participate in in Juneau. With enough notice I can get them back here.
