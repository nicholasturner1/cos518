        In addition to Kris' comments ... Nizich is working with the Legislative

        Affairs Agency to get a needs          list ( space requirements , number of

        offices including space for staff , phones, computers ,             etc.) for a longer

        special session .      They have not been all that organized or helpful until

        recently.     I think the public announcement last week was enough to show

        that we are serious about the special session. I have talked to Mike
                                                               1

         and he is putting pressure on Leg Affairs to respond and they claim to

        be finalizing a check list this week. If we don't get something asap, I

        will talk to Harris. I wanted to make sure you knew that both Nizich

         and Kris are working on the issue and communicating daily. Kris is

         doing more of the on the ground work to establish options.



         For what it is worth, I think Lyda does not look good refusing to give

         input.     We are doing what we can to get the logistical issues resolved

         so we are better positioned to have a successful session .         I think she

        appears as if she does not want to cooperate on this important issue.

         Sound like more of the same especially in light of the investigations.



         Sharon and I have talked to make sure our comments to reporters are

        clear.      If asked, we are reminding reporters and others that you

        announced your intention to make a decision on the location by September

        4th.      We just wanted to take the opportunity to receive input from the

        legislature on how we can make it more productive. It is puzzling why

        some refuse to give input.




        Mike

        FYI, I have not yet received anything from Mayor Whitaker. If I don't

        have it in the morning, I will call him. I also confirmed the Captain

        Cook, Marriot, Hilton and Egan Center's involvement in the Arctic Energy

        Summit 10/15 - 10/18. However, there are other options that can, and

         Kris and Mike: What is the latest on Fairbanks asking for sp session -

         and did Malcomb ever answer back on cpt cook for a sp session venue?



         Mike - is Nizich still the lead on sp session logistics? I've not heard

         anything from him on sp session info that's needed to make good

         decisions on location selection and time is zipping by, as I expressed

         back in May when we first started discussing ideas on sp session.



         Polling leggies got us nowhere except criticism for me not "taking a

         stand" and concluding where it should be held. Lyda refuses to give

         input, yet wins the argument then that I'm the only governor who "hasn't

         worked with..." the leggies on a special session.     (Her claim.)

         Meanwhile, we're waiting to hear any info on logistics that I need in

         order to make a good decision asap.



         The sooner I get the info, the better. If Nizich isnt the go-to guy on

         this, pls find a SouthCentral contact person so info can be gathered

        asap so good decisions can be made asap on locale. Thanks!
