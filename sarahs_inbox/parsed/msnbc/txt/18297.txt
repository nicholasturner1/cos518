         What was the deal with that group meeting in the conference room today on a "$5 billion
         green highway project"? Who met, why did they use the Gov's office conference room,
         what's this project, what's the lobbyist's role (Kubley?) in this? And who all were the
         folks in the hallway that I ran into after their meeting? And what is James Stanford's
         role in this? If Jim Clark and Tom Fischer used James to get access to Commissioners (and
         to kick us out of my conference room today to make room for Kubley's meeting), then that
         was inappropriate and unethical



         And what's Ron Miller's role in this?
