           MESSAGE:

           Dear Sarah, I first want to congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.   I have the
           understanding that the baby was born with Down Syndrome. I have a daughter who was born 6
           years ago with DS. On the day she was born, I had lots of questions and wondered why I
           had been chosen to be the mother of this beautiful baby girl who wasn't perfect. I was
           devastated.  The medical problems that are associated with DS have been numerous. Sooon,
           I learned what an absolute gift that I had been given. I now thank God everyday for the
           wonderful child I have been blessed with. I am not aware of your feelings or how you are
           dealing with the baby you have been given but I do you want to you know that if you do not
           realize it yet ......you soon will, that you have been chosen to raise an angel on earth. I
           wish you the best. Sincerely, Paulette Rowan
