               It's imperative that the media correct this.

              FYI, update on the FOIA from Channel 2. I reviewed the video clip today and noticed the
              extent of their inaccurate reporting Tuesday night in which they say that "by law the
              deadline is November 15th (today) and that MM notified them they'd not comply by the
              deadline..." The deadline to comply is November 26th. And, what they were told -.in writing
              - was that we needed to consult with legal on the sensitivity of disclosing third party
              information. I've worked with Sharon on this today and she has requested a retraction from
              Channel 2.   As you can see from below (and attached), Kristan provided them the totals
              without vendor specific info.



              Also they had an earlier information request on September financials and that information
              was provided to them by November 5th. We are certainly demonstrating our willingness to
              work with them and that is what Sharon reiterated to them today.
