        MESSAGE:

        Mam,rnl would like to encourage you to look at the state retirement benefits for Alaska
        Guardsmen who are also state employees. Unlike Federal employees, State employees are not
        allowed to purchase back their active military duty time to use toward state retirement
        benefits if they are using that same time toward a military retirement. State employees
        who choose not to join the guard are allowed to purchase their active duty military time
        back for state retirement.   I feel this is a disservice to your guardsmen who are also
        state employees.rnPlease re-evaluate this situation and do the right thing for your
        guardsmen!rnrnVickie Clay - guardsman and state employee
