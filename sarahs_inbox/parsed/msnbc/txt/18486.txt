         Thanks. Kelly knows we're out unless your office needs additional support from us.

        Thanks for looking into this. Here 's the latest I have from Kelly--I'll extract her from
        this and assume someone from your office will call Robert Silk's cell if you give a thumbs
        up. (Janice can get number from Kelly if she needs it)



         Kelly wrote to Sean: "ALSO--Robert just called to ask that if this does work out (I let
        him know it's being looked into), that we call his cell with a verbal confirmation as soon
        as we have an answer so that they can announce the flag being lowered at a 1 PM service at
        Fort Wainwright."
