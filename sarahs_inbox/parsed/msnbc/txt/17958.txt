        I just sent an email and I said Russ Kelly and I 'should have said I talked with Ed Wood.
        Sorry. Guess I should turn the hand held off and get some sleep. Tom

        Tha Mitkof Homeowners had the most contentious issue during my visit here, of course.
        Basically feeling that their voice is not heard. I told them if it helps to have a
        Commissioner here for a quick mtg, ill send someone to meet. So - thats what we need to
        do.
