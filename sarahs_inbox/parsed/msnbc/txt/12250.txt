            MESSAGE:

            Dear Governor,



            My name is Devin McGee and I am a young Republican from Pittsburgh Pa. I have researched
            your record and I felt obligated to contact your office . As we all know the GOP is in a
            tough situation after the 2006 mid-term election . I ask you as a conservative activist to
            accept the chance to be vice President if you are offered or get to Washington D.C. so
            that your voice can be heard.



            Thank You,



            Devin McGee



            P.S. I was happy to hear that you are a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
