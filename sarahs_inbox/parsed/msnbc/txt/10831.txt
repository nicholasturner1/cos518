            Governor,




            Later tonight, I will be sending you, and those copied here, the itinerary for tomorrow,
            including the morning's pre-press conference calls (cong deleg, leggies, applicants). I
            will attach to the email two attachments: (1) recommended Governor remarks, and (2)
            expected Q's and recommended A's. It will be similar to the email Marty sent you last
            night re the ( awesome !) LNG press conf today.



            Bruce
