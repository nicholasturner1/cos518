              Just spoke to Michael Hurley. Jim wants to invite the governor to attend a function at
              Providence tomorrow afternoon from 4:30 to 6:30.  A few months ago they made a donation to
              the cancer treatment center there.




              It seems there may be something else, too. It sounded like they were still hoping for a
              call.

             Joe- So how does this work with Ralph Samuels spending three days with FERC in DC
            recently? Any influence there?

             Sorry , I dont know what its about . I suspect it is one of two things , though . Either an
            announcement that they are filing paperwork with FERC under the pre-application process or
            that Enbridge is joining the Denali group.

                  They are announcing at 10:00 a.m. Which only gave us a 20 minute window to call - 9:00
              -   9:20 a.m.  Janice
