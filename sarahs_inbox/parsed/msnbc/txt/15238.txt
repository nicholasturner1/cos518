           Dear Governor,Palin,




           My wife and I would just like to congratulate you and your family on your newest little
           boy.  Your strength and conviction is a inspiration to all. My wife and I lost our first
           daughter to Trisomy 18 six years ago and we share the same pro-life values as you do. You
           can read her story at www.AChildOfTheLight.com. God Bless you and your family.




           In His Service,
