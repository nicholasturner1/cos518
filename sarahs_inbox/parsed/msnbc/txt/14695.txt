              Subject:                Ktuu polar bears


             I know it's Friday night and maybe nothing can be done at this point, but KTUU just
             broadcast their 10pm news tease with; "Is Gov Palin refusing to release a scientific
             report declaring polar bears..." ?



             I guess I'll see where they're going on the news tonight, but I know nothing about a
             scientific report that I'm refusing to disclose. If anything can be addressed between now
             and when KTUU rings some bell that we may not be able to un-ring, pls do whatever we can
             to make sure they're not incorrectly reporting anything. And if anyone knows about this
             report, I need to know what the issue is. Thanks
