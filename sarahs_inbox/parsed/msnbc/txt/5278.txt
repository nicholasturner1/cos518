                  But remember also we've been told we don't need legislative "permission" to require this... that it can be a
                  rule adopted by the appointing authority, correct?

                  We've given the amendment to Senate Judiciary for inclusion in the Governor 's bill.
                  The House subcommittee will take up their version this week.

                  It will appear this week... my prediction

                  JB,

                  Just wanted to check in and see where this was . I think you said the last time it was in Judiciary. Keep
                  up the great work.
