              SportsDome Withdraws $ 1.5m State Grant Request

              Anchorage, Alaska: June 19, 2007 -- Leaders of the Anchorage
              SportsDome, a large non-profit sports facility that is slated to receive a
              $1.5m State grant, have notified Governor Sarah Palin that they are
              withdrawing their grant request due to concerns that it promotes
              misunderstandings about the SportsDome's mission. Thanks to the
              financial support of ChangePoint church, private individuals, businesses
              and community sports organizations, the SportsDome has raised over 95%
              of its $17 million funding from private sources. The $1.5 million State grant
              was intended to help cover weather-related construction cost overruns.
              The SportsDome intends to replace the grant monies through additional
              private fundraising.
              Leaders of many community organizations supported the SportsDome' s State grant
              application, including the University of Alaska Anchorage, the Anchorage School District,
              the Municipality of Anchorage, and numerous soccer, baseball , softball and track-and-field
              organizations such as American Legion Baseball, Cook Inlet Soccer Club and Alaska
              RUSH Soccer. These supporters believe that a $1.5 million investment of State money
              makes good sense for a number of reasons:

                   ·     Many Alaskans will benefit from the SportsDome. Literally tens of
                        thousands of soccer players, runners, baseball and softball players,
                        football players, walkers, etc. will use the facility for personal health
                        maintenance and training for competition.
                   ·    Anchorage's athletes will no longer be disadvantaged by weather-
                        shortened seasons. Field-based athletics across Alaska will benefit
                        from a facility capable of hosting state-wide competitions.
                  ·     According to ASD Superintendent Carol Comeau the year-round
                        sports opportunities made possible by the SportsDome are, "a

                  deterrent to the increasing gang and youth violence issues in our community."
                      Private investors and contributors desiring to benefit our community have
                     paid over 95% of the SportsDome's development costs. It is remarkable
                     that our community can enjoy such a facility with so little public funding.
                      For the Anchorage School District, the SportsDome provides space and
                     opportunity equivalent to eight new high-school gymnasiums-a value to
                     the State of over $60 million.
                     The state of Alaska takes no financial risk with the SportsDome;
                     ChangePoint church is responsible for any operational losses.
             Leaders of the SportsDome project had intended this grant to strengthen this unique partnership
             between public and private non-profit sectors, allowing this facility to operate with minimal user
             fees and to benefit as many Alaskans as possible. Regrettably, misinformation generated by that
             effort has created such public confusion that to receive the grant at this point would compromise
             the SportsDome's primary mission.       In particular, the SportsDome and ChangePoint boards
             want Alaskans to know that this facility is a gift to the community , not one built at its
             expense.
