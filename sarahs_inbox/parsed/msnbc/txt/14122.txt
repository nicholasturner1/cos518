            I'm back from my extended vacation in Hawaii and back to work at THRHA.

            I just logged on my email for the first time and was pleased to receive

            the notice for the Southeast Women's Conference (sorry I missed it).

            Sounds like another successful event. Keep me on your email list. I'll

            be in touch. Judy

            I am extremely fortunate to have been able to be part of this women's

            conference and was could not have done it without the following: Diane

            Carrier, Sarah Lampe, my brother William , my sister Laura Sheldon and

            Myrna

            Foster. These people are continually stepping forward to make things

            happen

            for others . ANS must be proud of sister Sarah Lampe , Grand Camp Sargent

            At

            Arms who made a trip over to help and who also brought the seal meat

            that

            everyone enjoyed Saturday ! I acknowledge President Micalyn Kunz McGhee

            and

            her sister Nelly who were very much a part of this picture ; they are

            true

            inspiration of what ANS is all about. Thank you Connie for your

            continued

            respect and for checking on items that needed to be done ; you and Emma

            really shined. I truly love my mom and after hearing her speak will make



           more time for this wonderful lady so she can expect visits from me. I am



           glad she is up front and personal ; you learn from the best . Last but

                                                              3

            certainly not least I would like to personally acknowledge President

            Martin;

            it is a blessing to be working under his leadership. His genuine concern



            and support for Elders, youth, family, ANB/ANS and Southeast Native

            Veterans

            shows his commitment in making our organization a good one.



            I apologize for not making it in Saturday but had 9 grandchildren I was

            caring for. Our day ended after the free swim for them after 8 PM.



            I want to take this time and remind everyone that the last Native Issues



            Forum is scheduled for April 9th; Senator Kookesh and Representative

            Bill

            Thomas. MC Ron Williams. Our menu plans include entree items of Roast

            w/gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cream style corn, spaghetti

            w/sauteed

            onions, green peppers and celery, buttered dinner roll. Dessert: Cake

            w/strawberry filling. Pork noodles, bac-o salad,, macaroni salad, fruit

            salad

            and hopefully fresh herring egg salad if it arrives in time from Sitka

            (donated by Central Council). Thank you!
