                  Subject: Senate Elections/Energy

                 In re-reading the analysis prepared by Winningreen which I sent you earlier today, I
                 noted several inaccuracies about individual Senators.

                 I don't think that these inaccuracies change the ultimate conclusions in the report,
                 but they do detract from its credibility. Accordingly, we will get you an analysis
                 which is accurate in all respects so that we can focus on the conclusions rather
                 than the factual errors. Sorry for any inconvenience.
