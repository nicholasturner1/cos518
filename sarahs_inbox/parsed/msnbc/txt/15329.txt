          Janice- pls change "press conf" that's scheduled this week on budget to "release statement
          on budget". Thanks

          Sounds good. That worked well when we did SB256 vetoes. KJR

          Not sure how/why last year the decision was made to have the big "to-do" press conf to
         announce vetoes - don't want to do that this year. It sent a message of drama and
         political gamesmanship. (Perhaps we did it that way last be it was the new admin's first
         budget?)




                                                                 1

            So this year, tho I see it's been scheduled as another press conf, I won't be standing at
           a podium telling lawmakers in dramatic form what I just chopped from their budget.



           Instead, we'll release it with very solid and positive messaging in a good statement,
          minus the spotlight.




           We have the AGIA spotlight that overshadows vetoes this week . In studying preliminary
          AGIA work product the past few evenings, it's very, very apparent the necessity to focus
          on that for alaska's future versus getting sucked into veto drama that critics would like
          to see distract from AGIA this week.
