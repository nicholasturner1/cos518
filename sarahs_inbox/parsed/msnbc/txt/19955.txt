               Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Tinsley, the commander of the Third Wing at Elmendorf Air Force, died of a
               gunshot wound in his on-base residence Sunday night, the Air Force said this morning. Few details are
               being released, but an Air Force spokesman said there was no indication of foul play.
