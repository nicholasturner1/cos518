  Congratulations on your baby boy!
  I also wanted to let you know that I have leads on two floating processors that I believe are gearing up to
  buy in Ugashik this summer. They are both domestic boats, so they don't need foreign processing
  permits. Although Peter Pan already agreed to buy from about ninety percent of Ugashik setnetters,
  these two additional companies are great news, they should ensure that Ugashik fishermen are well
  covered this summer.
  Also I wanted you to be aware that Department of Law has advised us that making a decision on issuing
  an inland waters permit would raise Ethics Act questions for the Governor. If we end up getting an
  application, it could be an extremely sticky situation.
  All the best,
  Cora
