            For what it's worth, these types of concerns were considered by the team.



            We tried what we could to target the most needy without getting way out to where it would
            clearly be a non-starter with legis. There were limitations, though.



              Also, the size is justified by the need in the bush, but is something that legis' can
            scale back and take the public heat.



            It's a fair statement about lack of legis outreach, and we just didn't have time, but
            can't tell him that. However, it is also a function of the lack of leadership we can
            confer with and have confidence they're speaking for a majority of the body.

           Just wanted to let you know, Rep Doogan called today as a courtesy to the Governor to let
           her know that he does not support the energy plan. He doesn't want to surprise her when
           he makes public comments.

            His reasons are: 1 ) this isn't a policy  2) too broad, should go to those who really need
            the assistance   3 ) too much of a hand-out




            In addition , he said he thought it may have been helpful to the Administration to get feed
            back from . some law makers prior to its unveiling.




            It is best to know now what some of the concerns and criticisms will be before the
            legislation is introduced.
