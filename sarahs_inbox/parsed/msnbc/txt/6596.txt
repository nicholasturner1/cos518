        Dear Mr. Beadles:



       Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
       response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



       I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
       under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



       I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
       to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



       Sincerely,



       Sarah Palin

       Governor

        Thank you So Much for your thorough, thoughtful and extensive line item vetos of the
        recently passed state budget.



        No, I certainly don't agree with them all, like everyone I have my pet projects... but if
        those projects are so valuable, your veto will be overridden by the legislature. This is
        how it Should work, but it never does unless the Executive uses the line item veto as
        objectively as you have.



        As time goes by there is one practice I believe to be extremely valuable:



        I find a small bit of time when I can be outside alone. I take off my shoes and socks and
        plant my bare feet squarely in the dirt (or snow): Then I breathe in the air of the
        GreatLand.



        Can't tell you how/why this works, but it   certainly does.



        Good on Ya!

        Robert Beadles
