        Dear Mr. Bullington:



        Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
        response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.




        I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
        under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



        I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
        to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



        I appreciate hearing from you!



        Sincerely,



        Sarah Palin

        Governor

        Dear Governor Palin,



        I am happy to see you weilding the budget axe so artfully. Everytime the price of oil goes
        up the legislature thinks they have to spend most of it. Keep up the good work.
