            This '05 article obviously sheds more light on Aniak ' s frustration ... and it's all the
            more reason we weed out bad apples in ranks that lead some Alaskans to have this distrust
            of public safety efforts . Like we said in State of State : this administration will demand
            the highest standards of those serving the public in this safety arena so Alaskans can
            trust us.



            Rhonda - pls let me know what else you find on Aniak ' s (and Bethel ' s)               frustrations and
            issues the communities have with law enforcement . Thanks
