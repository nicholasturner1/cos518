              It's a follow up to Joe and my discussion earlier re: the perception too many people have
              re: us "not allowing" entities besides TC to be heard on gasline ideas. It was also a
              follow to an email I sent Joe today asking if anyone ever responded to Hickel's letter (we
              evidently haven't responded). Hickel's letter from two weeks ago re: their fears about us
              causing frustration due to AGIA...

              We WILL hear from All Ak Gasline supporters, agpa and angda... We are NOT going to "pull
             a Murkowski" and refuse to let others talk about their gasline ideas... even including
             supporting legislative hearings on all the ideas - this "gasline team is refusing..." is
             getting out of hand - we are listening, we will listen... and those applications will
             speak for themselves at the end of the day. We need to fix the misperception that's out
             there.
