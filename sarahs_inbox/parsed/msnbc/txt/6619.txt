       Dear Mr . Gieryic:



       Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
       response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



       I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
       under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



       I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
       to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



       I appreciate hearing from you!



       Sincerely,



       Sarah Palin

       Governor

        I'm writing to express my appreciation for your recent budget trimming efforts via your
        line item veto authority. In viewing the list of cuts, there was not a single item cut
        that I disagreed with (including those in my community). I agree with your approach that
        state funding should not be used to supplement traditionally local obligations/projects
        (particularly without a public hearing process ). I would however be in favor of a form of
        local revenue sharing, which would allow the local communities to prioritize and allocate
        the spending.



        Keep up the great job!
