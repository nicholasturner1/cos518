                 Subject: Remarks for One Lord Sunday

               Governor,
               I wanted to get these remarks to you as soon as possible, so that you could let me know if you'd like changes
               made. I can print these off onto two smaller cards that would fit in your Bible, if that suited you. Please let me
               know at your convenience if the remarks meet your expectations. Thanks so much and have a good day!
