  Kris:

  Although we couldn't make the schedule work for the Monday that the governor was in Los Angeles in
  early March, Leno, Jimmy Kimmel and Craig Ferguson (booker was cute - said something to the effect of
  "oh yeah, Craig's favorite governor!") were all interested.

  The next time the schedule will allow, we'll visit with their bookers again.

  Too bad it isn't Governor Palin with her 80+ percent approval rating on Leno!
