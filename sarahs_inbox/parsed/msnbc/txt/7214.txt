              Subject: Prince Rupert




            Our Emergency Management folks checked with Prince Rupert B . C. regarding the flooding going on in B.C. right
            now. The road and the railroad are under water from Rupert to Terrace , no traffic in or out . It will affect the Marine
            Highway system vehicle and passenger traffic . Marine Highways will be checking in with their folks in Rupert on
            the current status there . It's a forty year flood event B.C. officials indicated that there is no need for outside
            assistance at this time . The Canadians have sufficient resources to handle the situation . There will be a follow
            meeting with the Canadians tomorrow to see how things are going . I will report when I get the update.
