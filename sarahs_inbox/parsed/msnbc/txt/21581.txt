               I've heard nothing from Joe or the writing team , and have no idea if drafts are in the
               works . So I am apologetically sending my thoughts to you directly, as I don ' t know if
               something with my name on it will see the light of day otherwise.




              Unfortunately , today is a disaster -- big things exploding in my oil and gas world, so
              this was a major rush job . And I will not breach surface until tonight .  But here are my
              thoughts , for what they are worth , based upon your original draft.
