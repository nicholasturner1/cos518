          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin,




          I just want to let you know that I was inspired by your appearance on Glenn Beck's program
          a few days ago. PLEASE KEEP UP THE FIGHT FOR OIL!




          But on the other hand, as a member of "Free Republic," I have noticed that your name gets
          floated as an option for John McCain's Vice Presidential Nominee.




          Please do not accept. Fight the good fight in Alaska.




                                                                1




                                                                                                            PRA GSP01_0018926
