            Subject:                Going to arbitration with PSEA




            Governor:

           You may hear that we are only a half a percent apart with PSEA, and that is why
           negotiations have stalled.  Our last offer to them was 5%, 3%, 3% with service steps plus
           3.75% increase for members who receive an Advanced Police Standards Certificate (which can
           be obtained through education, length on the job or both). We continue to hold out for
           language which specifies that dishonesty by a State Trooper or Airport Safety Officer will
           not be tolerated.



           When you look at each contract it's not as simple as the cost of living (the 5% or in SU's
           case 5 .5%) it's everything else that is a cost to the State in the contract. Some
           contracts have "premium pays" like the trooper contract, uniform allowances, etc. while
           other contracts have a 'me, too" clause like SU (whatever a subordinate gets, I get).



           We'll have an update on our web page today and I'll make sure Sharon L. knows it's out
           there.  Not sure when they might start to run ads, but we've been thinking about how to
           address it.
