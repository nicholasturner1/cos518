 Ivy- pis make sure steve gets this (tho it doesn't explain we're talking about an AGIA sp session
issue).

Frank- do we assume Bill will get this?

And pis make suire this goes to all media, not just ktuu. Wesley needs a flippin follow up to make
sure he understands what we're saying here.

 Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request



April 23, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green's request to
expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin today outlined
her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can show a path to success.



 House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial-birth abortion, and House Bill 364, relating to
parental consent, failed due to inaction by the Senate. The Governor expressed disappointment that
Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option during the regular session to move the
legislation.



 "Alaskans know I am pro-life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of every human
life," Governor Palin said. "These issues are so important they shouldn't.be diluted with oil and gas
deliberations."



 Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently than last
session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the full Senate.



                                                   3                               ROSTON 02314
