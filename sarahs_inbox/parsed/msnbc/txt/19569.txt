                I do choose to support this, if for no other reason to prove we're willing to take on the strict
                oversight of anwr development - the question of environmental oversight has been an issue with

                Subject: ANWR/Congressman Ralph Hall - CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY CLIENT
                PRIVILEGE

                Congressman Ralph Hall (Republican, Texas) = called this morning to seek your support for
                draft legislation (pasted = below) that would convey the Coastal Plain of ANWR to the State of
                Alaska = in order to facilitate oil and gas development there. The Congressman is working
                closely with Congressman Young = on the bill and says that he has discussed it personally with
                President = Bush, who would sign the legislation if it gets to his desk. =

                I was non-committal pending this communicat= ion to you. There is no question that the Palin
                administration = su orts res nsible oil and as devel went in the Coastal Plain.&nbS7-- y:

               The legislation would also require a 50/50 = revenue share between the State and federal
               governments and would impose a = prohibition on oil exports. With the exception of a =
               few Alaskans, most people believe that these requirements are = inevitable in any ANWR bill
               that has a chance of passing.

               Recommendation: I don`t know whether the following would be completely = acceptable to Mr.
               Hall, but I would recommend the statement below in = response -
