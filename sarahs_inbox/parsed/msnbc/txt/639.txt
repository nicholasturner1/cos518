Governor, I added Franci to your contact list with email and contact numbers. I also called her to
relay your message. Franci said to "Thank you" for all you do for the Agriculture in Alaska.



I wanted to update you on flights that you had requested from Juneau to Skagway and maybe
Haines. You had asked to come back to Juneau the evening flight on Monday, 09.17.07. You would
then need to get to Skagway to speak at the Southeast Conference on Tuesday, 09.18.07 by noon.
Juneau to Skagway: 10:15 a.m. - 11:15. a.m. arrival. You could then return Skagway to Juneau: 3:40
p.m. - 4:40 p.m. then Juneau/Anc evening flight. This would be on Wings of Alaska. We can not get
you to Skagway and then have any time in Haines but for 1 hour on the return portion.



Barrow Flights for Thursday, 09.20.07 - (Honored guest - North Slope borough Oil and Gas forum).
Anchorage to Barrow: 6:00 a.m. - 10:36 a.m. (2 stops). Barrow to Anchorage: 7:55 p.m. - 10:58
p.m. This would put you into Barrow for all day. If you wanted to go from Fairbanks then the early
morning flight would only have (1 stop) leaving Fairbanks at 7:38 a.m.

Thanks, Janice

It was a nice and uneventful visit and tour of plant, considering the fuss they made last time I tried to
visit. No hairnet or paper shoes were even required, no CEO accompaniment was required, etc.



Pis pass on to Franci Havemeister so she'll know, in case critics try to make something out of my
short and sweet "pop-in" to the plant, so that I could say hello to employees.



I need Franci's email addy, too.
