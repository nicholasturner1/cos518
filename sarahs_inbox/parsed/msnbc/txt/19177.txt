         Mike - the "To Do" list still includes informing Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time (it's overdue) to move on.



          What process are you, as COS, using to accomplish this? Should I put it in
         commissioners ' hands (I spoke with Emil about Privile yesterday and you told me you've
         already spoken with Leo about Privileged .. I'll cc them in this note so they're prepared if
         they have to make the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already
         contacted them?




          I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks' service has
         ended. If I must inform them myself I will, but I need to know your intention on this
         overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better                    Privileged or Personal Mai
        Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


          Thanks
