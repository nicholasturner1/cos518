         Subject:                  Lyda



         I received a call on my personal cell as I was walking into Petersburg speech this
         afternoon - it was a guy mad about ABC Board not granting his fundraiser a liquor license
         permit for their event tomorrow night - asked me to work on it - I explained I was
         hundreds of miles away, it's a board decision, I was about to give a speech any minute,
         etc... So he should call his local legislator instead, if he could. He said he did - it
         was Lyda - and Lyda instead gave him my personal cell #. .



         So next time constituents have issues re: the Valley, we're free to give out her personal
         #, eh?
