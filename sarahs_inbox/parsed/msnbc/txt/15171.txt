               Subject: 05HUNT-Initiative Prohibiting Shooting Bears/Wolves from Air
              A hunting association wrote me a pretty detailed letter asking that I withdraw 05HUNT from the 08 Primary
              ballot given the legislature's passage of a bill specific to game that is on the governor's desk, I believe. The
              group says that under the new definitions in the bill, the initiative language proposes an appropriation of a
              state resource (there's that issue again O) and that the initiative should be ulled because it is not a ro er
              subject for the ballot. I have asked Law to review this issu      Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
