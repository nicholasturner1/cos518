            Very good . I'll think of a cool bill signing for that one - maybe to plug in to one of the
            invitations Janice and Kris have recently received for speaking engagements . Thanks

            HB 326 - the national guard/firefighter pay bill passed the Senate unanimously today.
            Next step is gov's signature.




            Another one down.-thanks to the good efforts of DMVA and DNR, etc.
