           What are the positions that leggies cut in operations, besides DPS and oil/gas? Pls
           advocate for those positions, but I can't imagine why we'd push for more new state
           employees outside those two areas, unless I'm missing something. AP reported we're asking
           them to restore 148 new positions? Outside the two areas, I don't support increasing what
           they cut.
