              Subject:                Lower Taxes on Gas on Bristol Bay




              October 30, 2007 Governor Sarah Palin State of Alaska Juneau, Alaska 99811 Re: Lower Tax
              Rate on Bristol Bay Gas Dear Governor Palin: I note in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that
              there is an effort to include Interior gas in the Nenana area for a lower tax rate. I'
              fully support making sure that Nenana gas and other gas such as may be found in Bristol
              Bay, be given special provisions for lower taxes the same as natural gas produced in Cook
              Inlet. If gas is found by and oil and gas company on lands in the Bristol Bay area, we
              should be given the same low -cost gas consideration as Cook Inlet. Thank you, Nels
              Anderson, Jr. Box 234 Dillingham, Alaska 99576 907-952-7039 cc: Robin Samuelsen-BBEDC,
