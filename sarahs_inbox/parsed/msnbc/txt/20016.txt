          MESSAGE:

          The shocking statistic is that 90% of women given a Down Syndrome diagnosis choose to have
         .an abortion.  Your courageous choice reflects well on you, your values, and the character
          of your family.




          It is horrific to realize that one day we could 'choose' which lives are good enough to be
          had.   Perhaps one dark day we will abort children of the wrong sex, height, orientation,
          or any other 'preference' the selfish parents playing God will decide upon.




          Thank you for bucking the trend, and saving a valuable life. We need more Americans like
          you and your child, to inspire the world to greater heights of-humanity and compassion.




          Hoping McCain selects you.
