         MESSAGE:

         Dearest Governor Palin,rnrn      I was looking over my options for the furture, and
         without a doubt plan to serve in the United States Army. However, I would like to join as
         an officer, and after looking up more information, I would like nothing more than to
         attend the Unites States Military Acadamy at West Point. I understand that it is possible
         to obtain Governor's appointment to the military acadamies, and was wondering how I can go
         about recieving such an appointment from you. I am a senior at Eagle River High School in
         Eagle River, and am an AFJROTC Cadet. I hope that I can hear back from you on this issue,
         as this is my entire future that I am planning for. Thank you for your time.rnrn
         Timothy Kuklis
