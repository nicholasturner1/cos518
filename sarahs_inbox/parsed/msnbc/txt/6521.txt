          Subject:                  extradition


          I have three new extradition orders today. The Criminal Division is hoping to have a
          quick turnaround.  They are...

          1) Fugitive from the State of Washington convicted of assault in the third degree who
          escaped from custody.

          2)  Fugitive from Oregon charged with burglary in the first degree, bribing a witness,
          criminal trespass in the first degree and theft in the second degree.

          3)  Fugitive from Texas charged with burglary (not such a smart guy, he was caught taking
          items from a relative to a pawn shop.



          If you are OK, I will sign them and move them along. Thanks.



          Mike
