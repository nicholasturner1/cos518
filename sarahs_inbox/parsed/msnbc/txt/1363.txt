  I've contacted the DOT person and we're looking into this. My goal is to give Kenny, Brenda and Nick a
  status report, and a "where to go next" point on the issue.

  I talked with Frank Bailey and he asked who would be the person to contact on this issue for the state.
  Frank, it is probably still in your court but Dick, you may know something about it as well. Anyway, we
  need to let Frank Bailey know who should be the contact person on this with Athna. Thanks

  Frank, thank you for following up on this issue. I'm out of state and don't have access to my hard files. I'm
  forwarding this to Nick Jackson and Kathryn Martin so they can have the information you've requested scanned
  and emailed to you.

  I may have some information from previous presentations to past administrations and will see what I can find.

  Again, thanks for following up on this.
