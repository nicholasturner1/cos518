            Governor, is it okay to just use our form for a letter of recommendation for this person? Kari.

            Kari,

            Don Shiest, former Public Works Director with Governor Palin would like to know if the governor would give him a
            character reference for a substitute teaching position in the Mat-Su School District. If a letter of recommendation
            could be written he greatly appreciates that. His phone number is 907-376-1462.

            Thanks,

            Mary A. Havens
