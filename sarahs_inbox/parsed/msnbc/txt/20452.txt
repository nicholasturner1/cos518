              Subject : CNBC next Monday

              Governor-

              Maria Bartiromo with CNBC will be in Anchorage next week filming an hour long special on
              oil and gas. They have requested an hour with you on Monday morning in your office. They
              are bringing quite an entourage with them. 2 cameramen, make up artist, sound guys etc.

              Also, 60 Minutes would like 15 minutes with you to talk about energy issues. They have
              been pursuing a story about oil and gas for about a year now . This will be the second time
              you have spoken with the producer.

              May I schedule both of these requests?
