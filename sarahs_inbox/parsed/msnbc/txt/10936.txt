                        Ron Stroman,

                        I have just checked my mail today . I still have not received any notification from DOT of the
                        Meeting for this evening . It is peculiar that I did receive mail postmarked January 5th from
                        NJ, and Mail postmarked from Anchorage Dated January 7th, but I have not received
                        mailings you state were sent on December 31, 2007.

                        Please reply to me promptly as to your willingness to reschedule this meeting.
                        Thank You,
                        Cheryl Fuglestad

                          Hi Ron,
                         No, I did not receive notice of the meeting, no one I have spoke to has received their
                         notice. I really do believe you need to
                         Give us 30 days notice for these meetings as per AS 44.62.190. It appears to many of us
                         that DOT is trying to have SCERET MEETINGS, with only the chosen fFEW. I request
                         that you cancel this meeting and reschedule with the proper notice.
                         Thanks, Linda
