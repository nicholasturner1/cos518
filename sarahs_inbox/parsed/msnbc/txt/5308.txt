             Mike - Received a call from Commissioner von Scheben this a.m. He wanted

             you to know the good news for DOT. The Concrete Tech contract for $11

             Million can be settled for only          Privileged or   . Russ has verified this with the

             Dept. of Law. Unless we hear from you otherwise we are going to let them go

             ahead with it and the paperwork should be done by this Friday.
