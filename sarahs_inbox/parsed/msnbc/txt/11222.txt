                 Subject: Thank you for your stand on the CON issue for Alaska
                 Governor Palin:

                 Thank you for your eloquent and principled "State of the State" address yesterday . Your love of Alaska
                 and Its people was quite evident. CON repeal will decrease medical costs and increase access for all
                 Alaskans . We are strongly in support of repeal and your administration.

                 Sincerely,

                 Larry Stinson, Elizabeth Stinson, James Stinson, Sarah Stinson, and Matthew Stinson
