             Looks good- will people know, though, that you're talking about the AGIA special session?
             We don't mention that in opening this statement about a sp session.

             Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request



             April 23, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda

             Green's request to expand the call of the special session to include

             abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin today outlined her willingness to

             consider a separate call if the Senate President can show a path to

             success.

            House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial-birth abortion,

            and House Bill 364 , relating to parental consent ,    failed due to inaction

            by the Senate .    The Governor expressed disappointment that Senate

            President Green did not exhaust every possible option during the regular

            session to move the legislation.



            "Alaskans know I am pro - life and have never wavered in my belief in the

            sanctity of every human life ," Governor Palin said .      " These issues are

            so important they shouldn't be diluted with oil and gas deliberations."



            Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do

            differently than last session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a

            vote on both bills by the full Senate.
