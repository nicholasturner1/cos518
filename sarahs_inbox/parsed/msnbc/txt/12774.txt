            Ok- thanks for the update. I've been wondering where it was. I'm double/triple checking on
            the Earmarks op-ed piece too. . .things seem to fall into thin air and I don't hear about
            them unless I'm bugging folks to find out. I emailed Sharon and Beth on the Earmarks piece
            just a bit ago.
