          All:



          The LG is definitely stuck in FBX until abt 11:20 am tomorrow, so he's a no-go,
          unfortunately.  I'll wait to hear from one or more of you as to whether I am cancelling
          the governor's role in the event. The earlier the better...




          I hope Trig is doing well!



          Kate

          Sorry guys, they are pulling my luggage of f the flight. More delays in Anchorage and the
          flight hasn't left there yet. I'm booked on tomorrow's 11:20 a.m. flight.

          One more thing...I was told that your personal event will be re-scheduled (from the
          original 11 AM timeslot) to later in the day, after the Bike Blessing, rather than for 10
          AM.

          I relayed the message that if the Governor's not able to make it to tomorrow's 11 AM Bike
          Blessing, you'll plan to attend on her behalf, if you make it back into town. I know that
          if you do make it out tonight, it'll likely be very late, with an etd of 10:20 PM. if I
          get final confirmation that the Governor definitely won't attend, I'll let you know ASAP.
          There's about an 85 percent chance that that's how it'll work out. I asked Kate to get
          the Governor's remarks (very brief--include part of the proclamation) to you ASAP tonight,
          so you can take a quick look, even if you don't end up needing to go; she'll do that as
          soon as she has her computer up and running. They're still working on getting the
          proclamation signed.

          That's all well and good but my plane is still on the ground in Anchorage due to weather
          and I am in Fairbanks. (If I am in town, I don't mind doing it, but whether I end up
          coming back in time for any of those is now up in the air.)

         Just got news that the Bike Blessing is still scheduled to happen, just won't have all the
         bikes.  It'll be an indoor kick-off to the bike season. Senator Murkowski is scheduled to
         be there, too. Your 11 AM personal event is moveable , I was just told, to the 10-10:30
         timeslot, which would'give you time to get to the Bike event, if you decide to do that.

          See Kate ' s note, below, about possibly standing in for the Governor at tomorrow's 11 AM
          Bike Blessing event at ANC City Church .   You're currently scheduled for a personal event
          from 11-11: 30 AM , which I was just told is moveable. Just fyi , tomorrow ' s Heart Run was
          just canceled , and I'm suspecting that the Bike Blessing might be too , but don't have that
          info yet .   Will you stand in for the Governor , if she ' s not able to make it in? (Need to
          have your yes or no ASAP , in order to answer the Governor , and in order to have your
          current 11 AM meeting moved , if necessary.

          Hi Kelly,




          The Governor is scheduled to present a proclamation at Anchorage                      City Church's Bike
                                                       3

          Blessing tomorrow morning at 11 a.m .   She's planning on attending , but there is a chance -
          between the road conditions and Trig ' s travel plans) - that she might not be able to
          attend.  Would the LG be able to stand by in case she can't make it? I have the
          proclamation and he could have her remarks if he wanted them .   Thoughts and availability?
