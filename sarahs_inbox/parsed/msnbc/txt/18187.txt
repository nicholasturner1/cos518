         This would be great and so appreciated by everyone. Ivy, I'll work with

        you

        and Frank on who to invite and details.

          Right on!     Don't you miss Kerm and the crew? I do. Frank can think of

          some

         names ,   and IN HER SPARE time Kris can think about this and maybe

          delegate to

         Frank the task of inviting the crew - maybe he still has contact info

         for

         the war room group of workerbees that got us here. Thanks!



         If after the Miner's game is too late, how about before it? (Now I'm

         really

         inviting myself.)

         I think he would say, "the more the merrier." I'll send him the info.

         Fun.

         Ivy:    hate to invite my own ideas on to someone else - but here's any

         idea: what if Don invited some of our crew to his bbq after the Miner's

         game - wouldn't it be great to get back together with Kerm and Glen and

         Bruce and other awesome workerbees that helped get us here? I can't

         find many available slots in this summer's sched to have a shin dig with

         our peeps - could we do it at Don's that evening?

         Hi guys!



         Thank you both for great bites of input on educ commisioner.



         Remember the Ed Bd picks and forwards name(s) to me for selection, then

         on to the legislature for confirmation.



         We need innovation in that seat. Both your names brought forward are

         great. Not sure why Ed Bd thinks it needs a nationwide search, which I

         heard recently. I'll ask Lynne Smith to check the status on that and ask

         what my input is worth in terms of their method of soliciting names.



         Thank you guys. You're awesome. Keep up the great work - I miss (six

         months later) our of rag-tag team of hardcore workerbees. Maybe the

         crew can get together for a shin dig soon? I know Kris and Todd miss

         the campaign folks too. Six months zipped by - I'd love for us all

                                                         3
