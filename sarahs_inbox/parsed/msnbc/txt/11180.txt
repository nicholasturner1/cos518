              Hopefully last word on this - Sharon, we did not change the time of SoS

              to 4pm. We gave up, gave in - this was Lyda's change, again. It's being

              reported that I changed the time from 6pm to 4pm.

              Sharon :   "This is nonsense . This was NEVER about acommodating "personal

             .travel arrangements ". Travel arrangements to my son's military

              graduation into the Infantry were made subsequent to Lyda's permission,

              given a month ago, to address Alaskans in the State of the State on the

              first day of the shortened session .     She knows this. And this is an

              unfortunate indication that some would rather spend time and resources

              on things other than working together and progressing this state."

              Sharon/Beth- lyda is saying this is so "the Governor can accommodate her

             personal travel schedule". Be strong and solid in response back on that-

              it's bull, she's again spinning this, and she must be called on this.

              Sheeeesh - lyda just changed it again to 4pm, even tho this may not be a

              "legal" sos because she says they won't convene until 6pm (AFTER the sos

              address ) and you' re supposed to present sos after they gavel in/convene.
