            Steve stopped in to see me today . He left his cell phone number incase you want to call him . He wanted to talk
            to you about AGIA and his interest in the Board of Regents . As far as the Regents go I told him that the next
            available vacancy will occur next year . He's in town through tomorrow. His cell is Privileged or 11

            I can call him if you are busy this afternoon.
