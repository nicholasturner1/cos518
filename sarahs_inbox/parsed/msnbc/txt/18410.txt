       Governor - let me know if you find the card ending in ...3085, we are ordering a card also
       for Todd. We will have you turn in all the "fleet gas cards" and then if you by chance
       pick up Todd's that will work for you too. Good Evening, Janice

       You're a gem for always seeking expedient solutions to our little daily chaos episodes.
       I'll look at those last #s of the credit card - thanks Janice! Go home and enjoy your
       boys.
