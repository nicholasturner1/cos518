          Denby:  Stopped by my sister's dental office so I could hear thunderous applause from her
          boss - Dr. Christine Roloff - who LOVED the outdoor women's retreat thing that F and G
          sponsors... She asked me to pass that along and tell Denby thanks for choosing her team as
          winner in the Moose Calling Contest.



          Also, met w /Clem Tillion - says you guys have good solutions to stopping IPQs and you just
          need the "go ahead " to do what' s right - so " go ahead" and if you need more details pls
          call Clem.



          Leo: plc call Clem re: input he wants to give you on fast ferries. Thanks!
