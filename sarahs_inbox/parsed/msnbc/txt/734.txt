paper, please correct her on who Sarah's dad is.



Thanks Todd




QUESTION ... Is Tom Anderson going to stop off on his

way to Oregon for Thanksgiving dinner at Bill

Sheffield 's place in Palm Springs? He and wife Lesil

McGuire celebrated the holiday there last year with

Lesil's dad and stepmother , among others . Ear hears

the guest list this year includes the governor's

father, Jim Palin.
