             Mike,



             I will have Janice Mason get in touch regarding the Governor's schedule. The first part
             of the week is fairly packed. It might be easier to set up a time with me and Nizich and
             have the Governor stop in for a few minutes, if possible. Look forward to seeing you in
             Juneau.



             Mike

             Hello Mike,



             I hope the session is going well for you thus far. 90 days will be interesting.



             I will be in Juneau next week for a few days and was wondering if it would be possible to
             get a few moments with Governor Palin to thank her for her support for Arctic Power? I
             would, of course, also like to discuss increasing the appropriation for FY2009 and our
             reasoning for the request. I met with John Katz and Larry Persily late last fall and had
             a very good discussion about the role of Arctic Power after the fall elections. Paula
             Easley will also be in town and would like to attend the meeting if we are able to get a
             few moments.  I get into Juneau Monday morning and leave Wednesday at noon. I am
             available anytime that works and recognize the Governor's time is extremely valuable and
             limited.  I also want to meet with you and Mike Nizich to discuss the issue and again
             recognize time and schedule limitations.



             Thank you.



             Best regards,
