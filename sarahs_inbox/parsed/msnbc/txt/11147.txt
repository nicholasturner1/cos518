             Can't do that. She must know my fit is at 8pm and I'd miss it. They're supposed to gavel
             in in the afternoon.

             In our Fagan Free Zone we were blissfully unaware .            :)   just kidding



             I understand now they're gaveling in at 6 p.m. and asking for your speech at 7 p.m. Glad
             you have an 18 minute speech . Can't believe they' re being so petty so early.
