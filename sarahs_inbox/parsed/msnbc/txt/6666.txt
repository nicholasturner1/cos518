            Sorry I missed your call last night! [Privile is still interested in the Health Council , but she's also interested in
            employment. I conveyed that she could serve on the Council or seek employment . She has an interview today
            with Bill Hogan ( Dep Commiss of DHSS).

            Would it be possible to meet with you tomorrow afternoon for a few minutes ? I'll check with Kari.

            Thanks,

            Ivy Frye
