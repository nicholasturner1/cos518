         Subject:                  Dot


         I finally found a good replacement for mike chambers at dot. An energetic and sharp
         reporter who's ready to go on a new path.



         Making positive changes in dot, even in that spot, is part of the "let's get back in
         transition mode" that you promised me we'd get back in.



         It is time. Now. We are back in transition mode and you have promised to help me, mike.



          From DOT, to    AIDEA, to communications folks, to another Leg Liason, to reigning in every
         dept's budget    before they're submitted and I'm forced to make the cuts, to all the exempt
         employees who    are fighting change every step of the way - things MUST change and we need
         to see major,    positive changes starting today.



         Thanks Mike - we can talk about this today as things can't be in this status quo situation
         a day longer or we will not be succeeding with a good agenda for Alaska. We need PEOPLE to
         be there with us, not fighting against us behind the scenes , and not setting themselves up
         for other opportunities a couple of years from now.




         Thank you!
