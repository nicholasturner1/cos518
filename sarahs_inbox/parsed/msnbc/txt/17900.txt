        Also, Joe, the Ethics Bill just passed unanimously in the House. This is very good.



        Things are good here! Despite the continued rain in Juneau!

         Hello Joe:



         Glad the word is out there that we have to take a hard look at the Mat-Su Prison plans.



         The only criticism I've heard about today's coverage of the issue is that no one informed
         Lyda of the concerns we had, and that she wasn't informed of any of this. I have a hard
         time believing that's the truth because I seem to recall hearing that we've briefed her or
         her staff anyway.



         So, if she's been briefed, either she or her press person (Jeff Turner) needs to be called
         on this. We'll suffer the wrath of Lyda and/or her supporters if she's let people believe
         we didn't inform her of concerns over this monumental issue . I don't want them to spin
         this into: "They're not communicating with us."



         Who knows what the motivation was when the reporter was told we didn't keep Lyda in the
         loop with her project, but it needs to be corrected so folks know we're not purposefully
         doing anything to undermine her project - we're just trying to be sensible.



         Thanks!

         Sarah
