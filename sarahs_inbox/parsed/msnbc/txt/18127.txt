        Dear Governor palin,        If I read your email correctly the resignation did

        not go through. It is addressed to Mr. McLaren C. Carter, Chair of

        Creamery Corp. and it reads:

                 Dear Chairman Carter,

                   In light of recent discussion and correspondence, it has become

        apparent to me that the duties and responsibilities that I have

        historically performed on behalf of the Creamery Corptation as its

        President and CEO have been and are being materially reduced.

        Accordingly it is with regret that I must tender my resignation,

        effective June 30, 2007.          Joseph W. Van Treeck"



                It is dated May 31, 2007
