            Subject:                 Gov's bills


            Mike- pis forward the list of Gov's bills that Stedman has put a stop to to all
            Commissioners - they are all affected by his action (and the budget action) - you need to
            call on them to chime in now, loudly, at this time. We can 't carry this all ourselves -
            many Commissioners may not understand these going's on and may assume we have not pushed
            hard enough on these bills and on the budget items that they need to run their depts. Ivy
            has the list of bills, you have the list of budget cuts. Please email Commissioners and
            seek their assistance.
