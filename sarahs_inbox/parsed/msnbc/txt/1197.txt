MESSAGE:

I love that your new baby's name has Paxson in it. Can you say why? My family owned and lived and
was raised in Paxson Alaska since 1959. It is a historic land mark on the Richardson Hwy. My brother
Stan, who was a friend of your Father's passed away very suddenly last November and I know how
honored he would be to know that your son's name has our family's home name in it.

Congratulations on the birth of your new son.

Respectfully, Pat Williams
