             I would be interested in such a thing in Juneau - perhaps a different group of recipients
             for this area? Maybe to benefit the local Crisis Pregnancy Center?

             Governor-

              I have been asked about a baby shower in Juneau. I have already received offers to host
             it.  Please let me know if you would be interested in a similair event.



              I too think the idea of helping young Army wives is fantastic.

             Yes, I'll give him a call initially and then have someone work with him on details. Love
            the idea about the young army wives.

                      Wants KWHL to throw me a baby shower . I say "yes ", if the gifts can go to these
             young Army wives who don't have much , they're far from their families, the dads aren't
             there for the newborns first months , etc. And now Ft. Wainwright ' s aviation unit was
             notified of a four month extension on deployments . Would u assign someone to work with Bob
             on that angle ? Thanks
