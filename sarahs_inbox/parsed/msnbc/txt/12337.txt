             John,



             I read the article and from my base of knowledge the governor's statement is accurate.



             As I indicated previously, Law can talk you through the legal theory but they likely can't
             provide a detailed analysis nor would it be adviseable (in my view only) to do so as it
             would likely divulge legal strategy. The producers know all about their duty to develop
             under the leases--



             I do not know what the context of the governor's remarks was nor what precipitated them
             but I believe her remarks to be accurate. (She's really saying Alaska intends to enforce
             its leases--the state has to live by its agreements in the leases and so should the
             producers.)



             Sean

             I will defer to the Lt. Governor on the legal basis for the Governor's statement.



             Lt. Governor, if you would like, I could contact Marty Rutherford or the Department of Law
             for further elaboration.

             John and Sean:

             Is the Gov on firm legal ground here ?      Is there a strategy for making this threat?
