              Mr. Katz: Whatever I can do to help, I'm there. I'll participate as much as G Gordon wants
              me to.



              Janice: pis schedule those times. And can someone correct the ADN before the erroneous
              info spreads even further that's he's "hired" to do this? It's worthy of an official
              correction. Thanks



              Kris : pls let Tom/Marty know I'm coming in to hear AGIA update at scheduled time, and if
              additional time can be dedicated to the messaging plan I will appreciate hearing from our
              folks on that topic. Thanks!



              Mike: pls ask Bd of Educ to send me, officallly, the next couple of names on their list- I
              want to get going asap on Commissioner appointment. I'm cc'ing Barb and Talis on it t6o. I
              need to know that they've received the official request (mandate) to forward me the next
              two names, so if I can get confirmation of that today I'll be able to scratch that off my
              list. Have them do so asap, thanks.

              Dear John and Larry,




              As I talked with John this morning Larry we have arranged to meet on = May 13th at loam at
              your offices to discuss the G.Gordon Liddy trip to = Alaska this summer . I will be
              bringing along with me Matt Fagnani of = NANA Management Services and Eric Helzer of
              CH2MHi11 who are the Arctic = Power Executive Committee members put in charge of the Liddy
              trip to = Alaska. We would like just to meet with you both and go over the = schedule of
              the trip and answer any questions you may have.  We are = trying to make this event as
              open as possible for the Governor to = participate in, to get her as much air time as we
              can with Liddy so she = can spread the gospel on Alaskan energy.




             Just to recap the trip is billed as Gordon Liddy on Alaskan energy = and what it means to
             the nation.   It will go on air July 14-18 from = Gam-gam each morning Alaska time. The
             first two days will be from = prerecorded material made July 12-13th from the Slope with
             the possibility = that July 14th might be broadcast from Barrow live with Mayor Itta as
             the = VIP guest. From July 16,17 and 18th the show will be broadcast live = from studio
             in Anchorage.   We hope the Governor is available either = by phone or in person in
             Anchorage during one of these days. We are also = looking to get Liddy as a guest
             appearing on other radio shows and = possibly TV nationally during this time.




             As I told John, Larry, the ADN article over the weekend was erroneous = in stating Arctic
             Power is "hiring" Liddy.  This effort by Liddy is = entirely voluntary and he will not be
             compensated in anyway other than = having his airfare/accomodation and meals provided for.




             Matt and Eric will be arriving on the 12th of May and meet with - yourselves on the 13th
             in the morning and then with-Liddy in the afternoon = in VA. On the 14th they are
             scheduled to meet with chairman Young's = staff , and Sens. Stevens and Murkowski's staff
                                                              2
