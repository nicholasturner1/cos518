           I have received a couple of emails from carol letting me know she was available if we had
           any questions. I don't know about a specific meeting request from her. KJR

           I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
           they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



           Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
           ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
           mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And'I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
           one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
           Carol needs to be called on this if she's not being truthful.
