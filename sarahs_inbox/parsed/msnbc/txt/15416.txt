           Dear Mr. Koch,



           I appreciate the City of Kenai ' s interest in DEC's plans for testing the Kenai River this
           summer for hydrocarbons . As you state , it is important to make an accurate assessment of
           the effect on water quality of the new regulations requiring cleaner-burning outboard
           motors . We have noted some confusion among the public regarding our sampling plans. Lynn
           Kent, DEC's Director of Water , will contact you to discuss the full extent of our plans. I
           will be happy to follow up on any remaining concerns the City has.



           Sincerely,

           Larry Hartig
