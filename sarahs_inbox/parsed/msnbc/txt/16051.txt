           Dear Governor:




           Thank you for the excellent job, you are doing. Your vetoes were perfect!



           At last we have a real Governor, "who stands up for us by standing up to us"




           We must prepare for hard times that are coming. Your sense of fiscal reality is
           outstanding!




           Your leadership is inspiring.
                                                                1
