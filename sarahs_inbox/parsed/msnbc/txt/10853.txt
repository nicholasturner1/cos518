            Statehood Celebration Kicks Off at Anchorage Museum



            January 4, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - Governor Sarah Palin unveiled the new Alaska
            Statehood Celebration license plate at a statehood celebration kick-off event at the
            Anchorage Museum of History and Art. The new license plate was designed by Sitka artist
            Dean Potter, the winner of a statewide logo contest.



            The new license plates will be the standard plates issued through 2009. Motorists who
            wish to change their current plates may purchase the new statehood anniversary plates for
            $5 at the Division of Motor Vehicles.



            "This is a great start to what will be a wonderful year leading up to the 50th anniversary
            of statehood," said Governor Palin. "I encourage all Alaskans to take part in the many
            celebrations that are planned around the state."



            The Alaska Statehood Celebration Commission, established in 2005, has organized numerous
            events to commemorate Alaska's 50th anniversary of admission as the 49th state. The
            events will take place across Alaska on dates that coincide with the historical events
