          Still can't believe the anti-predator control mission outsiders are on. Anxious for us to
          reply.

         Governor and Mike,



         I received a call this afternoon from Dale Hall of the USFWS. He indicated that he and the
         Secretary of the Interior just decided to honor the Governor's request and granted a
         fifteen day extension to the state to review the new Polar Bear data and make comments. I
         thanked Mr. Hall for the phone call but indicated the Governor's letter to the Secretary
         requested a minimum of a 60 day extension. He said that it was his understanding that the
         Governor requested a 15 day extension. I indicated again that was a minimum of 60 days to
         give the state an opportunity to review the mountains of new data. He said that is all the
         secretary was willing to go. I seriously doubt they personally read the Governor's letter.



         Denby call and essentially confirmed the same information with Mr. Hall and got the same
         answer as I did. So we got the extension, it's not even close to what we asked for so we
         will just have to make the best of it. Thought you should know. We now have until October
         22 for final comments.



         Mike Nizich
