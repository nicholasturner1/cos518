          Leo- ADN wrote an editorial today re: continued work and expenditure on Juneau Rd. There
          needs to be clarification on my position there, which I thought we expressed to interested
          lawmakers two weeks ago - the letter explained that the Corps had not permitted it, and
          there were many hurdles it seemed before the possibility of permitting... so I don't know
          what "continued work" is that ADN is writing about. Is there money in the budget for the
                                                              1

           more Juneau rd planning? If there is, I need to know where it is, how much, etc. The rd is
           not a priority for our admin, esp knowing the Corps may not even permit it.



           I'm not clear on what the ADN refers to re: cont work on the project, except for the fact
           we're waiting for the Corps to tell us whether it is even permittable. If it is, THEN
           policy decisions are made regarding spending any more money on this project or not. What
           money is being spent today, before we even know of the Corps' decision? My understanding
           is we're NOT spending money on the project at this time, that it's essentially at a stand-
           still until Corps does its thing with its evaluation. Thanks
