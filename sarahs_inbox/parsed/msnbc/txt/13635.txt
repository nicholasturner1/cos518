                Governor Palin:




                Congratulations on a successful legislative session.                 From DMVA's

                perspective, we accomplished our objectives.               No increased personnel and we

                held the line on our budget. Most importantly two of your legislative

                priorities passed this year.



                First, SB 214 passed both bodies and gives Alaska National Guard members in

                good standing free hunting and fishing licenses.                That was a direct response

                to your meeting with our soldiers in Kuwait last year. Thank you.




                Second, the Emergency Fire Fighting legislation which provides pay equality

                for National Guard personnel placed on state active duty for fire fighting

                passed both the House and the Senate. HB 326, the EFF bill, is on the way tc

                your office for signature. This too was a Governor sponsored bill, so I want

                to report that both of the pieces of legislation you requested for DMVA have

                passed the legislature.         Thank you very much.




               10/22/2009

                                                                                                               PRA GSPOI_0015085

                Let me know if there is anything I can do to support you between sessions. I

                look forward to starting the budget development process for our State 2010

                budget later this year .       It is a distinct pleasure working for your

                administration.
