                Kari,

                Can you please contact Lori Cameron, Executive Director of The Energy Counsel, and
                let her know that I will be representing the Administration in the presentation of
                AGIA on Saturday, March 10? Lori's contact number is (972) 243-7788. Joe and I
                will be there together.

                Thank you.

                -Pat
