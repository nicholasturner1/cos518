   Janice,

   Can you check w/Mike Tibbles on this? I faxed materials down on this from Todd and Polar Express yesterday. I
   also faxed to Russ, but realized today that he is still on vacation. I believe the deadline on this is tomorrow so any
   action must be taken very soon.

   The letter will need fine tuning.

   Thanks,

   Kris
