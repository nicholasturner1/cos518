               Gov. Palin vetoes capital projects


               JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) _ Gov. Sarah Palin has vetoed scores of public works projects around the state.

               Palin's vetoes totaling more than a quarter billion dollars were made public on Friday _ the deadline for
               her to sign the budget.

               Palin struck $268 million in roads, school improvements and other local projects from a nearly $3
               billion budget that lawmakers approved last month.

               Palin warned lawmakers there would be vetoes . She said they had failed to build a
               fiscally prudent plan.
