          Bummer.  This was transmitted on 5-12 and due back 3-4. Doing something for memorial day
          would've been perfect. Huggins/Stedman are sponsors but so is Dyson.

           Yep- but does anyone have any plan at all to do something on this, I wonder? We sure miss
           a lot of good opportunities be sometimes no one knows "who's on first". I'm going to check
           around on this and we won't wait for McHugh to orchestrate it for us.

           hunting/fishing licenses that we worked on this session? These troops are worthy of a good
           event to announce the benefit they can receive.



           Pls let me know when and where we'll do this before their fishing season really kicks off.
           Thanks



           Also- Randy- any word on what happened yesterday with the missing proclamation at the Mem
           Day ceremony?
