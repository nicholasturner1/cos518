           Not yet. I ask Commissioner Kreitzer do an electronic search to see if the subject email
           got out of house electronically. She is still working on it.



           I am in Juneau today and have personally talked to my Headquarters and the Southeast
           Management team to let them know how disappointed I am regarding this issue. I told them
           that I thought what happen was a terrible way to do business. I will take the emails sent
           by you and work with them without passing on. I am not sure yet if the email passed
           through SE and on to the outside world but I am 80% sure it did. I also told them that
           you are my boss and theirs and they need to get on the bus of supporting our Governor.
           They heard that message loud and clear.



           I discussed Juneau access road with them and said that we will go through the permit
           process and if the permit comes we will meet with you to discuss next steps. I said the
           legal process will probably be next and up-to-date estimates will be needed. I told them
           to prepare a white paper and dollars and status of the project so I could present to you
           where we are with dollars and work wise.



           I will keep you informed as I find out more. LEO
