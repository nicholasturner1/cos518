           Thank you! It's still pretty surreal ... and we know we'll only be given what we can handle
           by our good Lord. Thanks!

           Todd and Sarah,



            Sharon and I are sooooo happy for you :) It really meant more than you know how special
           it was to hear ahead of time. I hope the baby takes after both of you. Alaska needs more
           people like you.



            God bless and we will continue to pray for you daily asking God to bless you richly.



            Tom and Sharon
