           Don't know if I'll be in Juneau on Friday evening still. My understanding is Foresters had
           a couple of times offered for me to greet them. Also, Janice- pls scoot up Larry Stinson's
           stop-by mtg to earlier in the day instead of 4:30... I spoke with him at lunch today.

           Janice and I had a short conference call this afternoon with Elan Frank, whom you met in
           LA. I wanted to touch base and make sure that you are still onboard with this commitment.



           Elan will travel to Juneau next week to begin filming his "Women of Alaska" pilot.



           He would like to interview you for about 45 minutes (Janice will schedule) and then shoot
           footage of you during some activities on Thursday, March 27 and Friday, March 28, whatever
           is NOT private.



           What we had discussed in his office was some footage of you in meetings and also some
           footage of you with your family.



           He will also video during your Friday evening welcome at the AK Association of Foresters.
