              Governor - Good Morning and Welcome to Sunny Juneau!

              I just received a phone call from the 4th of July Parade Committee here. They had heard that you may be
              in town and would like to extend an offer to you. They have a 64 Thunderbird Convertible that is available
              for you to ride through the Parade in. You would need to be available tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m. to
              do this. Harrison Ford is rumored to be here also (sighting at Baranof Hotel) and they have asked that he
              ride in Parade but because of Security they say he has already left town.

             I also just talked with Bob (ANC office) and he checked on the Caravan for July 20. This would be from
             Wasilla Airstrip to the Fairbanks Picnic and then to Chena Hot Springs. The Caravan is available at that
             time. From Wasilla to Fairbanks is approximately 1.5 hours. Fairbanks to Chena Hot Springs is 20
             minutes . The plane can overnight or come back the same evening.

             Thanks, Janice

              In fact, the only reg or "rule" I've heard on this is that the First Family kids are eligible for per
              diem everytime they travel, but I've never collected the kids' per diem checks and Linda Perez
              had me officially state that we would not be claiming any per diem for the kids so they finally
              quit cutting the checks, as they went uncashed.

              There are no regs specific to first family travel. The ethics code is the driver here. There are always
              invites for the entire family to attend events throughout the state . Communities not only want the
              Governor but more often then not invite the entire family.

             Huh? Is he writing a story on the First Family's invitation to attend a native celebration? The
             state only bought one, one-way ticket for only one other member of the First Family (only the
             return fit), as not all 7 of us attended, of course.
             When we're invited to a family event I do road trips when possible, but Barrow aint a road trip.
             They were thrilled at least Piper could make it out of the first family members.
             And we didn't even spend the night so no hotel!
             And my travel is 1/4 what Murk's was, despite having a large family that's always invited to all
             these Alaskan first family events.

              Governor -

              Just an FYI. I talked with Kyle Hopkins at length about First Family travel. He specifically asked
              about the Barrow trip and why the state should pay for Piper's travel expenses. I explained at
              length that there is a certain obligation and expectation of the First Family to participate in
              community activities and make public appearances. He said/ will say that I could not give a
              specific regulation that spells out First Family travel guidelines. I told him that it is unfair to ask
              me for a specific regulation - after hours - before a holiday and if necessary, I would call Nizich or
              Linda at home. He said that was walking out the door and he would let his editors know of my
              concerns. I insisted that he - attribute to me, that a regulation exists.
              Hopefully, I will portrayed accurately in the paper tomorrow. Thanks.

          I explained that to them . They seemed more hung up on regs than anything . I am hoping for

          Itta DID want the family there- it'd be more offensive to have NOT brought at least one of
          them to such a family-oriented celebration.

          Comparing Murki's travel is key here.



          Also I bet Kris could get Mayor Itta or someone to indicate the desire and/or specific
          request from the community of Barrow for the whole family.



          This is of course ridiculous. The community of Barrow was elated that you and Piper
          visited.
