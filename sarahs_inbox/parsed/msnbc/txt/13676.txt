            Congratulations on picking up the Daily News this morning and NOT             finding another story
           on the business license e - mails . I figure it ' s one of two reasons:        1) Wesley never had
           anything more , and was just trying to annoy you ( not an unheard of           tactic); or 2) He
           wanted to do another story and ran out of time or his editors shut             it down because it was
           nothing new . Either way , good chance this is the end of it.
