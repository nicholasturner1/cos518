        There was a little bit of a snafu over the weekend. DNR requested 600,000 in ARLF funds.
        That was switched to general funds in the Senate. In the house finance committee, Meyer
        cut it in half. . .with our ok. Once the word got back to him that we really needed the
        full 600, he went right to work on it. Tonight, the House adopted an amendment on the
        floor to go back to the full 600.

          Meghan,



          What happened to the $650 , 000 that Rhonda Boyles said was available at the

          last meeting? More drama , more confusion . The word is that the $350,000 is

          being used for some drilling rig operation in Bristol Bayj per order from

          the Govs office?




          Can you please confirm?



         Rob

         Mat Maid makes last grasp for state money, survival

         DAY OF DECISION : Board meeting Thursday could decide dairy's fate.



         By S.J . KOMARNITSKY , Anchorage Daily News



         Published : May 16, 2007



         WASILLA - - The Matanuska Maid Dairy may be in line for up

         to $300,000 in state funding , but it may not be enough to

         save the struggling state - owned dairy and the handful of

         dairy farmers that rely on it to buy their milk.



         State agriculture officials said they ' re not even sure the

         Anchorage-based dairy will get the money.



         As of Monday , the state capital budget still contained $ 300,000

         for the dairy ,    half of the $ 600,000 in an earlier version

         of the bill.
