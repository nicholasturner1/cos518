          Here 's the schedule for three weeks of home games ,             then hopefully we'll have a playoff

          E- when's a home football game for JDHS? Maybe the travel date(s) would coincide with
          catching a game . The girls and I, anyway, could stay over long enough to catch one if Todd
          and Track have to get back after photos.

          Tib- anyone know when the king air has to return from servicing? I assume it has to fly
          thru Anchorage? If so, maybe that's a good way to get my family down here for First Family
          events incl the official family photos (which a year later we still haven't done), the
          mansion Christmas photo shoot (Erika's on it - she'll put wreaths on the door or fireplace
          and we'll call it good... Maybe outdoor shot with wreath on exterior), the Alaska Magazine
          photos with family in Juneau, etc. Otherwise, we need commercial reservations soon.



          The sooner the better on the christmas pics! My kids are getting busier than ever and it
          will be impossible to have everyone together if it's not in the next couple of weeks -
          just for the day is good enough. Do you want Kris to help me on this one?



          Todd- what date's good for you? I can take the kids out of school if need be. Either king
          air or commercial...
