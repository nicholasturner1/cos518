          Tib- anyone know when the king air has to return from servicing? I assume it has to fly
          thru Anchorage? If so, maybe that's a good way to get my family down here for First Family
          events incl the official family photos (which a year later we still haven't done), the
          mansion Christmas photo shoot ( Erika ' s on it - she'll put wreaths on the door or fireplace
          and we'll call it good... Maybe outdoor shot with wreath on exterior), the Alaska Magazine
          photos with family in Juneau , etc. Otherwise , we need commercial reservations soon.



          The sooner the better on the christmas pica ! My kids are getting busier than ever and it
          will be impossible to have everyone together if it's not in the next couple of weeks -
          just for the day is good enough. Do you want Kris to help me on this one?



          Todd- what date's good for you? I can take the kids out of school if need be. Either king
          air or commercial...
