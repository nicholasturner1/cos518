        Governor -



        Commissioner Monegan called me directly and asked to meet with you tomorrow. This is the
        first time the Commissioner has called directly for scheduling. I have not spoken with
        his office to this regards previously. He will be bringing Deputy Commissioner John
        Glass.  Mike T. and Randy Ruaro will be calling in from Juneau to join the meeting. The
        Commissioner knows that it is just for 30 minutes. It is in regards to DPS Issues - Crime
        Lab, Second Aircraft, Public Safety State Employees. Thanks, Janice
