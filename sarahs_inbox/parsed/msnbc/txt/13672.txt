           Janice said rga was willing to pay for staff to travel - ask her if they'll pay for first
           spouse instead of staff

                J- instead of rga paying for staff, and/or rga (or state) paying for Security on this
                Texas trip, pls let them know First Spouse is available to travel instead - they can pay
                for Todd. Pls chk on flt availability for him (on my flts). Thanks
