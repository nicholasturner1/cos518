            Dang!  Does Tibbles know he did that? This is like the fifth time Bill has thiefed our
            initiatives. The online checkbook is Tib's idea and he's been working hard on it. I'm Ic-
            ing him.

            Thanks for the heads up Kim.



            I think we should sit down internally to discuss. Although pride of authorship isn't a
            concern of Governor Palin's, my fear is that Sen Wielechowski is getting out ahead on
            something that originated with Governor Palin and that DOF has already been working on.

            Hi Kim and Jerry,




            Attached is a revised draft of the bill that would mandate creation of an "online
            checkbook" for the state. I think the drafters made all the changes we discussed. Please
            let me know if you see any other problems. This bill is scheduled to be introduced in the
            first batch of prefiles. Please do not forward it to others at this time.



            Thanks,



            Michelle
