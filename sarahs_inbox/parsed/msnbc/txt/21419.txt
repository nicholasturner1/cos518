               Pls keep Friday real flexible. I'm going to do a few things with piper that day... I think
               we'll do that costume thing at the mall that afternoon and I'll have her visit her teacher
               too. Also, is Juneau chamber on sat? I think we'll go to Juneau Christian Cntr on
               sunday.
