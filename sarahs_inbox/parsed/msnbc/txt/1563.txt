Hi Todd,

Thanks for the new address. I've been out the last two days, Kaitlin

has been home sick. I have a few requests that I'll send to you
                                                         1                                ROSTON 02869




 Released to msnbc.com by the state of Alaska and presented by Crivella West
tomorrow. I've had a couple of requests for your daily/weekly calendar,

but since we don't keep one for you, Mike Nizich just said to respond

accordingly. I have an Outreach Calendar that you can review, at your

convenience, and add or delete any necessary events or functions that

you attended. Mostly they would be Workforce Development issues and

issues that you are interested in.

Thanks,

Erika
