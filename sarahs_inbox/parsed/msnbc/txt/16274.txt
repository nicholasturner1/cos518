             May I offer them a phone interview on Thursday? Is this something you could do while
             heading down to Soldotna/Homer?

             According to the Supreme Court website , the Exxon Valdez decision = will not be issued
             today . The opinion could be issued on Wednesday = or possibly Thursday of this week, as
             there are now seven cases = remaining .  We will keep a close eye on this progression.



             Per my discussions with Mike Nizich and Rosanne Friday night , we will = now turn our
             attention to distribution of the ANWR letter and will work = with Rosanne on a press
             announcement.
