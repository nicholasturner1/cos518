           J- as you schedule, keep in mind the Lt. Governor is offering to pick up more of the
          events and speeches that I can't make, so please tap into him. Cabinet members are
          equipped to accept some of the invitations too. Thanks for doing so much, all! I'll see
          you soon- Nizich will be up there tomorrow.
