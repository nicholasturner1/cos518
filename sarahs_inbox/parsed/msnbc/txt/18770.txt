        Mike- you're up on this controversy with Beigel and the emails I've sent Talis to let him
        know about it (and Beigel's request to talk to the AG about it)... Instead of Talis having
        to meet with him on it, pis call Beigel to find out his beef more thoroughly. Frank's been
        running interference here, I wanted to wrap up my comments on this in that final email I
        sent Beigel on Saturday before he went back on the air to "guess" about our position on
        homeschools... Pls call him be it was your name mentioned as the guy who "steered me
        wrong", according to Beigel"s rant on the Fagan show. Try that tactic before Talis spends
        any more time on this - Frank, too.
