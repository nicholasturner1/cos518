            Subject:                 APOC


            I'm going to sumbit my APOC disclosure forms asap, they're due in a few days, so I'll need
            the camapign-recived gift list that discloses those items worth (whatever the amount
            it)... I believe it's held in both the Anchorage and Juneau offices?



           Also, Todd- what's the # for SmithBarney so I can get a list of all your 401K plan
           holdings. And did Bristol and Willow get paid for comm fishing in '07? How much? And who
           were the fish buyers last season? And no changes in properties bought/sold last year,
           correct? The buying/selling took place in '06, I believe? And legally Deb Richter's name
           is off the cabin property, correct?



           Thanks
