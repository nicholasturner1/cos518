           Dear governor palin.   This has nothing to do with the attached email chain .      Unfortunately
           I am on my blackberry.    I just wanted to give you a few updates .   Today in anchorage our
           attys argued the federal case for upholding a city tax exemption for church school
           housing.  One of the arguments is that secular institutions allow it.      Judge Spaan
           apparently focused on whether the exemption established    liaion     The media wa s there in
           force. The anchorage Baptist temple supported our side .  Privileged or Personal Material Redacte

           Exxon supreme court argument. I am sure you have heard about it. My thoughts are that

           Justice Thomas said nothing. The other seven present justices all had questions . Privileged 0

           One other thing there is apparently a daily news reporter trying to check whether I am

            Sharon- I'm shocked and disappointed Chenault' s taking out PSIO positions and BP corrosion
            lawsuit funds out of my budget. Is back here in DC speaking with Cneney ( sat with him the
            entire State dinner last night), will try to speak w/Bush today ... speaking with national
            reporters and all these governors all about AK's proof that we can provide sound oversight
            of resource development, as evidenced by PSIO, lawsuits to hold industry ' s feet to the
            fire re: waste of valuable natural resources , etc... and here while I' m away I find out
            the legislature may undermine those efforts? It ' s unacceptable if the nation is to
            believe we're capable of responsible, ethcial ramped up development that's need in our
            state, for our nation..
