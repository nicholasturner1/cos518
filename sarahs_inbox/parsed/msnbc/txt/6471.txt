            Dear Governor Palin:

            In reference to HB 113, Optometric scope of practice bill, I just noticed in the Primary
            Care Optometry News, 8/1/2007, the following article that is excerpted below and the
            web site if you wish to visit is: http://www.12consul2ersite.com/default.asg?ID=15700

            The quote is from President-Elect Kevin L. Alexander, OD, PhD: "While optometry has
            developed an effective means to credential entry-level optometrists , the profession has
            side-stepped a similarly rigorous method of certifying continued and advanced
            competence ," he said.

            This statement by the President-Elect of the American Optometric Association
            underscores our concern regarding this legislation . Neither the Alaska Board of
            Optometric Examiners nor any national optometric organization is equipped or prepared
            to certify the advanced competence that the provisions of this bill would require. Given
            that this bill would give optometrists one of the broadest scopes of practice in the United
            States, Alaskans would be placed at greatest risk. "Rigorous methods of certifying
            continued and advanced competence " should not be "side-stepped" in this state.

            After reading this quote I believe you will agree with our concerns regarding this bill and
            how it will lower the quality of healthcare/eye care to Alaskans.
            Thank you for your time and consideration.
            Sincerely,

           Carl Rosen, MD
