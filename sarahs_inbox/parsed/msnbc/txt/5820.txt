           Governor,

           Thank you for the clear message . DEC is preparing to phase in an off-shore Ranger Program this
           summer. There will, of course, be details to work out, but we will stay rooted in the legal requirements of
           the initiative . As we progress with our planning , we will be having discussions with the sponsors of the
           initiative regarding how well our implementation plan matches the intent of the initiative.

           Thanks,
           Larry

           FYI - went on record again today strongly supporting the will of the people re: off-shore
           monitoring of cruise ships (as per direction from cruise ship initiative)... strong off-shore ocean
           rangers program, not merely on-shore monitoring.

           thanks!

           also gave kudos to Carl Gatto re: his efforts w/the issue. I probably ticked off Kyle and a few
           other legislators, but I sincerely believe we owe it to the public to fulfill its will as voters did
           approve the ocean rangers program along with the cruise ship tax.
