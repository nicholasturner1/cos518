             MESSAGE:

             I know that you are very busy; but I would like to let you know that I think you are
             doing a great job leading our Great State. I like the fact that you are trying to keep a
             handle on spending and saving funds for hard times.



             I have sent emails to other elected representatives letting them know that I disagree with
             their attitudes and their wanting to spend like there is no tomorrow.



             Thank you.

             President of Chapter # 891 Vietnam Veterans of America.
