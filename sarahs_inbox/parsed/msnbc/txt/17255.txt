             Mr. Dalton,

             To our knowledge, the FBI is not investigating senior DEC political appointees
             concerning allegations they punished regulators for being tough on the oil industry.
             Rather, the FBI as part of the Federal Grand Jury investigation of BP's actions on the
             North Slope has interviewed past and current DEC employees concerning BP's North
             Slope oil spills.

             DEC is prohibited from discussing the content of Susan Harvey's personnel records
             because they are confidential under state law. See Alaska Statute 39.25.080.
