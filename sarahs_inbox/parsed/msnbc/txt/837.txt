      Mr. Stan Hooley, Executive Director
      Iditarod Trail Committee
      P.O Box 870800
      Wasilla,. Alaska 99687.0800

      Dear.
        Mr.Hooley:

      I'd like to thank you, Deby Trosper, and Jim Palin for taking the time to meet with me
      and members of my staff to discuss the continued use of the Willow Airport as the
      Iditarod restart point.

      The State has been honored to have the restart take place on`Willow Airport. Over the
      years, we have been pleased to accommodated, the needs of the restart and have done as
      much as possible to make the restart easy and safe. However, as we discussed in our
      meeting, the Department is unable to offer the Iditarod use of the runway areas offered
      previously for vehicle parking. Asyou .are aware , the Willow Airport is subject to a
      Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Airport Improvement Program Grant. Under
      this grant, the State was required to sign a grant assurance commitment that requires the:
      State to operate the Airport under federal standards.

      As a: result.of the State allowing vehicles to park Yn and around the'rtinway ditrir g the:
      Iditarod event, the FAA has placed the Willow Airport in non. compliance under the grant'.
      assurances and has the de'termined.the"airport is ineligible for feature federal fianding of
      airport projects. As a result of this action] the Department will not be able to
      accommodate vehicle parking as we previously have done.

      To continue the department's support of the Iditarod,: we have offered and continue to
      offer use of an area, approximately 8 acres in size, to the Iditarod Committee that should
      be of sufficient size to handle the anticipated vehicle demands for this upcoming year's
      event and possibly for future events. ,Further, use of this area for vehicle parking will not
      be in violation under the ' federal grant program.

       However, as you're aware, this area is treed and must be cleared before it ean,.b used.
       We received word from AIC, the contractor doing the Hicks Creek project that they are
       willing to offer their services to the Iditarod to do the necessary clearing: The people to
       contact are, Mr. Ken Yakee, President or Mr. Brent Cleaves, whose number is 746 -17`02
                                        -7 7
       There is a weather observation instrument within this area that tTie: State will have
       removed by the time you start your clearing effort,

      It is imperative that the Iditarod Committee make every effort to clear this area to support
      the restart. Again; we are sorry that we can not offer the same accommodations for
      parking but we believe that relocation of the vehicle parking area is in the best interest of
      both the Iditarod and the State.

      If you have any questions please contact me or Ron Stroman,.Chief, Statewide Aviation
      Leasing at 334-2695. Thank you.

                                                             Sincerely;




                                                             Leo von Scheben, P.B L.                 M.B.A.
