              Hi Karl,

              I hope this note finds you well! Nikki Guilford and Susan Dotchin mentioned that you were inquiring
              about the typical participation in the Govs' Youth Program during our Annual Meetings . I wanted to get
              back to you to provide some background information.

              As you may know, our Annual Meetings often have a smaller turnout of Governors (as opposed to our
              Winter Meeting here in Washington , DC). This summer, we are expecting about 35 governors to attend.
              In recent years , the Youth Program has had about 15 -20 participants . The kids range in age generally
              from ages 5-6 up to mid-teens . We have had older teens and even college-age govs' kids occasionally
              participate in selected activities (usually water-themed activities --such as water parks, day at the beach,
              Duck rideltour of waterfront in Seattle , etc.).

              I have attached a chart showing the potential pool of govs' youth who might participate in this year's
              program. Since we have 12 new govs this year (including one who is not married and does not have any
              children/grandchildren), it is a little more difficult to predict how many youth will attend the annual meeting
              and participate in the Youth Program. Based on past history, however, govs' children
              (grandchildren) from Louisiana, Maine , Michigan, Montana , New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, South Carolina,
              South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming have participated in the program. From anecdotal reports, I have
              heard that kids from Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, and Oklahoma may also participate this year.

              Additionally, if you are interested in learning more about states' policies and practices re: use of a state
              plane by the Governor and First Family, I will be happy to post a question on the Spouses ' Staff listserv.
              The spouses ' staff are very active listserv participants and may be able to provide useful information to
              you. Also, during our Spouses ' Seminar this year in Oklahoma , the spouses themselves were discussing
              this issue!

              Please let me know if you have other questions or if I may be of assistance .     Take care, Marcia
