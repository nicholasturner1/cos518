                  Subject: supplemental

                Lyda got to be a bit nervous about the supplemental . She inaccurately claimed that you would support every
                valley project (if it made it back in ). Her shining example was the balifields , which voted unanimously to not
                support the full amount . She can' t possibly think that it is a good use of state resources to fund the Palmer Arts
                Council . And she got too far out supporting restoring the $5 million for the Palmer-Wasilla Highway , which is not
            i   needed until FY2010. In my last conversation with Stedman , I passed along that we are finding problems with
                some items in the supplemental . He is very anxious to know which ones and claimed , "there is no need to throw
                rocks." My response is ... of all the nerve.
