           Governor,



           Alex thought I was working late at the House and I think he called and got you...
           Thinking it was HIS mom- he gave the phone to Brent- who thought my friend & I were joking
           with him- Brent was thoroughly confused... so he hung up. So if that's the strange call
           you got just a bit ago... sorry about that- it was my goofy family.



           I can't wait to see your kids & mom tomorrow!



           Erika
