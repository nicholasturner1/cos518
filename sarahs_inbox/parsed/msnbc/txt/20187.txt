             Governor - Meg just emailed me with the request for an Interview with Investor 's Business Daily with
             Reporter Monica Showalter (15 min.) Regarding AGIA. Kurt Gibson would be available to join you also.
             These must be the talking points for that Interview request . We just need to pick a time. Janice

              Governor,

              My sincerest apologies. I forwarded to Sharon an outdated copy of the national talking points earlier today.
              Attached is the latest with the most recent It is all the same information as you had last week for Kudlow, with the
              exception that we added an AGIA section toward the top of the document and then potential AGIA questions
              under that section, too.

               Thank you. And again , my apologies. Kurt had to slap me up-side the head tonight before I realized what I had
               done!

               Meg
