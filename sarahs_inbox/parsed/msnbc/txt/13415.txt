                                     Governor Palin Responds to Expanded Call Request
               April 23, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska - In response to Senate President Lyda Green's request to
               expand the call of the special session to include abortion bills, Governor Sarah Palin today outlined
               her willingness to consider a separate call if the Senate President can show a path to success.

               House Bill 301, which prohibits the practice of partial-birth abortion, and House Bill 364, relating to
               parental consent, failed due to inaction by the Senate. The Governor expressed disappointment
               that Senate President Green did not exhaust every possible option during the regular session to
               move the legislation.

               "Alaskans know I am pro-life and have never wavered in my belief in the sanctity of every human
               life," Governor Palin said. "These issues are so Important they shouldn't be diluted with oil and gas
               deliberations.
               Governor Palin called on Senate leadership to explain what they would do differently than last
               session to ensure that Alaskans will finally see a vote on both bills by the full Senate.
