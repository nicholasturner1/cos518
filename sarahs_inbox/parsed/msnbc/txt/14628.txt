             Gov. Palin,




             I read that you have given birth to Trig, who has Down's syndrome. Our daughter Akia also
             has Down's syndrome. She is now 32 years of age and continues to be the joy of our life.
             Should you wish to contact us to hear our experiences that may be useful to you and your
             family, please feel free to reach out to us.



             We wish you and your family the very best.



             Norton & Santa Bonaparte
