             Governor,



             Good morning! Here is the Wasilla budget information you requested yesterday. Kris will
             print off a copy to bring to you at the luncheon. I will also make sure Kelly has a copy
             with her. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need anything else. Just
             a reminder that the entrance to the Grandview Hotel is through the Chili's
             driveway/parking lot on the Parks Highway. Thank you!



             Kate
