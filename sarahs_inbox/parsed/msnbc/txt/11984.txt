           Okay - I will let Sharon know that something else has come up and you will not be
           available for the interview.  I think this is a wise choice especially for Track.

            I jsut talked to track- he said this may tick off his leaders so really dreads it and asks
            that I not- says he will be treated differently if anyone makes a deal out of it and does
            not want any special treatment. I can't blame him

            I'll talk to them since I just got another comment re: questioning my support of him being
            in military (ie. perception that I haven't wanted to talk about it be I may not be
            supportive? Geeez ). I'll talk to them, put it to rest and show support for all militaryl
