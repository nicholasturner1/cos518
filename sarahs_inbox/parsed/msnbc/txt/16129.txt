              Fallico, 66, had cancer, said Ann Potempa, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Health
              and Social Services.

              Fallico retired from his job as the state's lead medical examiner in April, a position he held since
              2001. He had been on extended medical leave since October 2007.

              During his tenure, he was a well-known figure in courtrooms, in the news and among law
              enforcement around the state. He performed 1,577 autopsies, including those for some of
              Alaska's most gruesome crimes.

              In 2005, he appeared in the Werner Herzog documentary "Grizzly Man" about the bear mauling
              of Timothy Treadwell. His brief onscreen interview telling the morbid and riveting details of
              what happened grabbed the attention of national film critics. A New York Times reviewer said
              he was a "character around whom an entire reality show could be built."
