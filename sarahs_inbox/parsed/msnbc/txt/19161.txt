         Mike - the "To Do " list still includes informing
         that the state thanks them for their service and now it's time ( it's overdue ) to move on.



         What process are you, as COS , using to accomplish this? Should I put it in commissioners'
         hands (I spoke with Emil about Privile a yesterday and you told me you've already spoken with
         Leo about )''Privileged 6.. I'll cc them in this note so they're prepared if they have to make
         the notifications), should I contact them myself, or have you already contacted them?



         I am ready to go on seeking replacements - pls let me know that these folks ' service has
         ended .   If I must inform them myself I will , but I need to know your intention on this
         overdue action that will allow the state to move forward with better Privileged or Personal Materi^
       Privileged or Personal Material Redacted


         Thanks
