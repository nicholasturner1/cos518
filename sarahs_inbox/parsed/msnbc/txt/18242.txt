         Msg also has to include: "the creamery bd voted to close MM, hence their work is done and
         they'll not have any task in front of them anymore..." (Is this accurate? Wasn't their
         entire mission to operate the now defunct MM?) "...hence the need for a new bd with new
         focus..."
