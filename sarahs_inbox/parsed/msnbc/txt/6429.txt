        Messaging special session: can we say it's about restoring trust and creating a climate of
        investment here (leading to jobs for Alaskans and a fair share for the state)



        The restoring trust part of the message is about removing the taint of corruption and
        starting anew, the creating a climate of investment part speaks to what's in it for
        Alaskans and says that we are about creating new wealth here ...we are not about moving
        money from Alaskans' pockets to fund state govt. (Philosophically we're saying we support
        giving everyone the opportunity to prosper through new investment to the state--wealth
        creation, not redistribution.)

         Whitaker said that they would make it work should Fairbanks be considered... and would
         submit a proposal .  I kept it kind of vague since it was before the pending announcement
         and final messaging . Malcolm is also enthusuastic about helping . He and I are meeting
         tomorrow afternoon to discuss that and other items.

         Sharon- would u correct with Steve Quinn the fact that I've only traveled outside once
        since session ended? He wrote online ( will be printed tomorrow ) that I've spent my time
        traveling out of state during the interim . The correction is I was in Michigan for the two
        days before traveling to Kuwait , but otherwise have been wrking from Anchorage and
        traveling within the state.



         Also , ktuu made it sound like we'll have details on sp sess tomorrow, incl location and
        incl Pat's analysis. He's not ready to reveal findings on that, nor propose solutions yet,
        so tomorrow ' s messaging will have to be well thought out . We also dont have location
        chosen yet either as fairbanks and Anchorage will hopefully be competing for the session

         (Kris spoke with mayor whittaker on this, I haven't heard yet if anything was decided from
         their conversation and/or other conversations with the Capt Cook in Anchorage...).



          I'll cc the others so they can help with messaging for tomorrow. I will focus on taking
         up Speaker Harris' request to revisit ppt back many weeks ago and the reasons he gave then
         as to why leggies need a sp session.
