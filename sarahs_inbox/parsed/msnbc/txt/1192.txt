MESSAGE:

Dear Governor Palin,



Yesterday evening as I was flying back to Juneau from a business trip in Seattle, I had the pleasure
of chatting with you and your husband Todd in the Alaska Airlines boardroom. It seemed as though
you were engrossed in a book so I spoke mostly with Todd and tried not to intrude on your
opportunity to relax. Little did I know that your were in labor at the time. I'm impressed that you were
gracious enough to speak with me even though you both obviously had much more important things
on your mind. In retrospect, it would have been totally understandable if you had just asked to be left
alone. My prayers will be with you, your new son and your family.



Sincerely, John Carlile
