         Well. As well as the BP call. Exxon , as per expected , wasn't encouraging - but TRex does
         say he'll meet me in person.



         Unless I sit down w/Mulva (he should be in AK in July), I'm not sure we'll be getting an
         app from them, despite his promise they would during session . I so encouraged him - told
         him ideally they would be partnering with us on the gasline. He was most concerned about
         CP's rep in AK. I said it's good. Quite good.

           His staff called my land line, got Tony on the line - fine conversation.



          Let's make sure the other calls are as logistically smooth as possible. I hate to keep
         people waiting when I. know their schedule is packed too.



          So now my understanding is the next call has been cancelled and I'll wait to hear back
         when I'm supposed to try again. Sooner the better in knowing when Mulva is next available.
