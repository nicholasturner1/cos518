         Dear Mr . Stock:



         Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
         response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



         I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
         under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



         I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
         to control spending, live within our means , and save for the future.



         I appreciate hearing from you!



         Sincerely,



         Sarah Palin

         Governor

        using the veto to trim the budget. Looking at the cuts from the Fairbanks portion

        of the budget I concur with each. Our State should not be funding non-profits.

        Alhough I voted for you, you were really an unkown, to me, at that point. Your

        efforts have been impressive to date and I believe you have earned my vote and

        support in the future.
