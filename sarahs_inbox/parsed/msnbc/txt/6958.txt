            Kris is right. Bill is a member of the AK-Alberta Bilateral Council . This board serves at the governor's pleasure. I
            will draft the letter of removal now and also contact him, and send an electronic copy of the letter to the press
            office.

            Thanks,

            Ivy

            yes - pis follow up with Linda or have someone do follow up for you.
            pis work with ivy to remove bill from any and all B & C's he's on.
            pis work with Gary/Bob at Security, as I was told by a security person yesterday that bill allen did travel
            with Murkowski - don't know how many times, but they'll know.

           Ivy - we'll ask Meg to do a presser today on removing bill alien from B & C service.
           Kris - pis CC -in Frank Bailey on these issues, thanks.

             I just learned that Bill Allen has served , and still serves, on the Alaska-Alberta Bilateral Council. This

             attended the working group meeting in Edmonton in May of 2004 . Murkowski attended as well as Greg
             Renkes and a number of other state officials . I have a list of attendees that I'll be faxing to Karl. The

             will fax a copy of that agenda and participants as well.

             In November of 2004, Bill Allen attended the Council of State Governments trip to Thailand with
             Murkowski , Mrs. Murkowski and Margy Johnson . Murkowski was president of CSG at the time. Veco
             sponsored the trip for $ 15,000. Documentation will be faxed . Following the CSG trip to Thailand, they all

             Kari - would you document for me the times Bill Allen accompanied Murkowski and/or Clark
             on trips, incl the international travel(s) - some of these also included Margy Johnson.

             It will be necessary for you to ask other commissioners/staff for info on this.

             Kris may be able to get some of that info with you. Thank you
