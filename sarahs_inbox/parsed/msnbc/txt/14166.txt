             It is something involving BP and Conoco. They will have a press release out at 9 am with
             a press conference at 10 am.

            Just in case you hadn't heard this already ... rumor ...



            Two major oil companies will hold a press conference in Anchorage tomorrow, Tuesday, to
            make an announcement.



            Company officials will be in the capitol later that day to answer questions and give more
            details.
