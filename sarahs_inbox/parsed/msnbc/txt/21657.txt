              Hello Governor,



              Yes, I received it and we'll get it taken care of with the least amount of fuss .



              When this phase of the plumbing project is        over I had requested to have the portable W/D
              moved to the 3rd floor linen closet, so it        shouldn't be an issue. I apologize for
              involving Linda in these kinds of matters.        My understanding is that she was not opposed to
              taking care of this ; she wanted to work it       so it wouldn't appear like something out of the
              norm - i.e. using areas that were closest to      existing 220 outlets and running the conduit
              from there .   I think that we're fine if we      include it with the w/d on the 3rd floor.



             .It's good/helpful to know how you want things handled, so I appreciate your feedback!



              On a day like today-I wish the bed was ready to go for you to use right             away!!



              Thanks,

              Erika

              Thanks Erika.



              I misunderstood and didn ' t realize the bed was already in the cedar closet . Yes, see what
              it would take to get the power extension there ... it shouldn ' t take much and should be
              compared to a situation such as during this renovation had we had a need for a dryer to be
              placed upstairs instead of in this guest bathroom - what would that extension take? I just
              don't want Linda making a big deal out of this- and don ' t want family requests to be made
              public in any way as they had through Stephanie . Thanks!
