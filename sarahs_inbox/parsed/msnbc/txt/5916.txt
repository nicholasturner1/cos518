              Any chance the Governor can be back in Alaska on the morning of July 28?

                Because of the number of scheduled visits to Kuwait, the Department of
                Defense would like to postpone your Mid- East trip from July 16 to July
                .23rd.

                NGA's summer meeting begins on July 20th and ends on July 23rd. I
                mentioned that these dates might conflict with the rescheduled trip. DoD
                responded that you could begin the trip on July 24th rather than the 23rd.

                 However, since Friday is the Sabath in Kuwait and Iraq , nothing much happens
                 that day, according to DoD . Therefore , a sequence which usually takes five days
                 would be compressed into four.

                With all of this in mind , I ask for your guidance on what you would prefer. Would
                you want to leave NGA early, assuming you are going? In the alternative, would
                you prefer to start on July 24th or to postpone the trip all together for a while? I
                believe that DoD will not schedule additional gubernatorial trips after mid July
                until the fall because of summer heat in Kuwait and Iraq.

                P.S.
                I'm sorry that I wasn't able to participate in more of the Cabinet meeting on
                Friday. I hope my comments made some sense notwithstanding static and
                echoes . If you get the chance some time , perhaps we could do a teleconference
                with the Chief of Staff to catch up on federal issues that might be of interest.
