  Randy,

  See Todd's notes below re: our conversation this morning on fuel. Thanks for slowing the
  process down so that we could introduce some logic into the equation.

   when fuel is bought and sold with net,your paying for
   what your getting with weather conditions factored
   in,like it is today.

   buying net and selling gross does not compensate for
   the weather.

   currently today refineries are selling diesel at net
   and retailers/wholesalers are selling diesel at
   net,which is temperature compensated to 60
   degrees,which is all fair.

   I want to make sure that Randy/Leo understand that
   selling gross does not compensate for temperature when
   it is bought at net,


   thanks
