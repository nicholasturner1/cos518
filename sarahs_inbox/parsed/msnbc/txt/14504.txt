                Subject: Wayne Anthony Ross - DNR permit decision

              Governor:

              I spoke with Wayne and let him know DOT feels very confident its' permit appeal will be successful and the
              decision by DNR to not allow the asphalt plant next to the river will be reversed . I will let him know when formal
              action is taken by DNR . (This will probably take another 2-3 weeks).
