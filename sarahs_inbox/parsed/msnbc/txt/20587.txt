              Importance: High
             Governor,

             Here are your remarks and event info for tomorrow's event. Please note that the LG will be just landing
             when the event begins, and so will likely miss the opportunity to speak in the opening ceremonies. Sen.
             Ted Stevens will be present, and Congressman Young is unconfirmed at this time. I will ask Susie to
             keep an eye out for any legislators or dignitaries and provide you with a list to add to your remarks. Susie
             will also have an extra copy of your remarks, just in case.

             Just as an FYI, if Piper is with you for this event, there are tons of kid's games and contests to participate
             in. Please Jet me know if you have any questions or concerns and have a beautiful weekend!
