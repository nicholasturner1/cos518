               Thanks Governor. Randy is in committee right now and will let us know what happens . I don't think he'll
               make a decision on the bill today - it sounds like tomorrow morning . We will do our best to work with
               committee members and state agencies on a final proposal that will then go to H FIN.

               Governor.

               Both Co-Chairs of the C & RA committee, Rep. LeDoux and Rep . Fairclough and some members of
               House leadership , Rep. Olson, Rep. Chenault? want to amend the resource rebate bill as follows:

                 1. Add the $1,200 per person resource rebate payment as a separate line item on the PFD checks
                    and check stubs / 1099's (for people that get direct deposit)

                                                                                                                     Page 2 of 2



                 2. Not have any supplemental application process for persons that did not quality for a 2008 PFD. (This
                    removes an estimated 40,000 persons that our supplemental process in our bill are estimated to pick up).
                    This would save 40,000 x $1 ,200 in payments (over $40 million) and the $500,000 cost of Revenue to
                    running the new resource rebate program . These are persons in Alaska who don't qualify for a PFD
                    because they have not been here long enough, etc).

                 3. So that we do not miss veterans who receive VA benefits that are reduced by PFD payments so they do
                    not even apply for the PFD and would otherwise be left out in the cold by limiting the $1 ,200 to persons
                    getting PFD's, they would creates a new alternative payment program for just those veterans . The cost for
                    picking up the veterans alone is probably under $7 million.

              In my opinion , we cannot get the bill out of the committee without these amendments but will defer to Kelly on her
              measure of the committee.

               Mrs. Palin -

               I cannot believe you threw such a fit when Randy Ruedrich was conducting R Party business
               during work hours. YOU have been conducting personal business on state time. What's the
               difference? I am ashamed that you presented yourself as so truthful and honest and you are
               nothing more than a liar and a joke now in this state. You talk about moving Alaska forward and
               you have done nothing more than take us in the opposite direction. I hope Walt runs for governor
               after the investigation forces you to resign.

               Good riddance and the best of luck to Trooper Wooten!

               Rina
