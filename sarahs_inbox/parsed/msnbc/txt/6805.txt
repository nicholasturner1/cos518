        First, and most important, all board members serve at the pleasure of the governor. Mike
        Barnhill from Law confirmed this for me in March.



        Second, Don Giles' term expires 6/30/07. He was appointed by Murkowski 5/13/2004.



        Duncan Fields and Kevin Adams also have terms expiring 6/30/07.



        The statute doesn't specify if the president/ceo of a seafood processor must sit on the
        board.  I think Law would agree the statute is open for interpretation and you could
        choose anyone employed by the processor to represent the processor. I will make sure this
        is the case.



        It does specify that the processor must have an annual payroll in Alaska of $2.5 million
        or more.  Large processors currently on ASMI:

        Trident

        Icicle

        Peter pan

        Ocean Beauty



        All Alaska processors with an annual payroll of 2.5 million or more:

        Trident

        UniSea

        Icicle

        Peter Pan

        Westward

        Ocean Beauty

        North Pacific

        Norquest



        Large processors on the board currently:

        Joe Bundrant, VP of Trident
                                                                  1



                                                                                                              PRA GSP01_0001384
