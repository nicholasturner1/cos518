                Governor-

               The media got wind that a sexual harassment complaint was flied against Commissioner Kopp in
               2005. The accusation was investigation and found to have no substance. Commissioner Kopp said
               that he spoke to you and the It. Gov about the allegation during the transition. I just want to make
               sure you are aware of this - reporters are asking if you knew about this before he was hired.
