            The discussion yesterday went a long ways towards getting the Creamery Corp headed in a
            good direction.  They need to liquidate their remaining equipment and assets, sort out
            what obligations will be potentially outstanding (like the pending personnel lawsuits),
            and can then turn to dissolution of the corporation.

            we're overdue in soldifiying the shuttering of MatMaid plan. Pls ask Dick, or Joe A,
            what's the plan? $39g, plus the miners' money to be given to farmers, then the case is
            closed, correct?
