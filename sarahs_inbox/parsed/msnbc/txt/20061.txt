          Kelly- this is assuming you'd NEED and/or want to be there for the ceremonial bill
          signing. If not, we can swing it without you. We have wanted to use the event to honor AK
          women, especially.

            Joe- gotta kill a few birds with one stone on my trip up there, so if I could meet with
          miners, state employees, whomever needs a visit... I'm happy to do it on this Fairbanks
          trip.

             Janice- any chance the King Air would be available? Thanks, all.

         .Since I'll be in Nenana on Friday for the bridge ceremonial bill signing, I can get up
         there the day before to meet with Mayor Whittaker on his energy issues.

            Possibility in getting out there to meet with Bernie (at Chena) to hear his geothermal
         ideas too, during this Fairbanks visit.

            Remember part of the purpose for the Nenana event is to honor AK Native women w/naming
         the bridge... so besides Britta and Kelly staffing me for that (and Joe needs to get to
         Fairbanks so we can talk energy, too), I would think Rhonda and/or Tara Jollie would want
         to participate? And if Kris wants to staff up there, then great... If not, that's cool
         too.
