              FYI



              The reporter from the Sunday Times of London never called me back after I told him that I
              may be able to swing 5 minutes with the Governor.



              Governor-

              May I use Larry ' s response should he need something in writing tonight?



              "My approval ratings have nothing to do with it . Nor do ' political smarts' and
              independence . Nor does anyone ' s prediction that the listing is inevitable . As the governor
              of Alaska , I believe the listing is premature , a misuse of the law and a wrong answer to
              the problem of global warming . Whether that is a popular stand does not matter ; I believe
              it is the right stand . And regardless whether polar bears are listed , I have a
              responsibility to speak out and comment during the public process . I disagree if some
              think I am wasting my time ; it's never a waste of time to debate important public policy
              issues."
