Yup no sweat on the trip . 5pm tonight is the deadline on tkts so if its a go we ' ll need to know before
then, but I can understand Todd' s concerns as well.



You have no idea how jazzed I am about Michael W!!!!! Been to several of his shows and performed
his songs since the early 80's. Thank you SOOOOOOOO much. Too bad about Annette, she is a
really good person and would have loved to make it I'm sure.

Hi fb. I'm talking to todd about trip if/when he calls this morn. He thinks it makes no sense, the
logistical headaches plus the costs for a short amount of time. He may be right - so don't sweat it if it
doesn't come together - I'll let u know as soon as he let's me know.



Annette was invited to join us for Michael W Smith lunch - shell be out of town and is so bummed be
he's a favorite of her's. She told Janice shed be crying herself to sleep in her pillow knowing she
missed meeting him.



I guess the Gov's House is pretty torn up w/repairs, hope he'll overlook that!
