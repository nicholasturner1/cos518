             MESSAGE :

             I heard on the news that you were considering endorsing Senator McCain but you were going
             to talk to McCain and Huckaby first. I don't feel that you should limit your conversation
             to McCain and Huckelby . Romney should be considered as well. I think that he is one of
             the best candidates.  He holds very strong convictions in the various topics of
             discussion. The Economy, National Security, Immigration, I really don't like the way
             people media has been portraying him to be non Christian and when you think of the title
             of President he resemble a President. His background is clean and he shows dedication to
             his sense of Family. Which is what America is all about; protecting and preserving our
             great land for our future generation to be raised in a safe and strong country. He
             displays a strong sense of Integrity, Knowledge and willingness to work with both sides
             for the improvement of our Country.
