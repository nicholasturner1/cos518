          Dear Governor Palin,

                 If you want me to talk to you with Comm. Monegan let me know . I was going to the
          Denali Commission special meeting where theoretically the entire cabinet will attend,
          however, just send the word and I will step out to either call or walk over to your
          office.



                    Talis

          A quick brief of the Togiak's Tribal Court's Banishment order of their City Police Chief -



          Last week , I spoke to the clerk to the Tribal Council, Anna Ferguson , who wanted me and
          AST to be there when they banished Police Chief Aaron Parker .  I advised I could not and
          that AST does not have any authority to carry out a banishment order . from a tribal
          council .  She paused and reflected on that but Rhonda McBride believes that they still
          intend to carry out that order on 5/8.
