                 Subject: Meeting with Mayor Hornaday / Homer

               Governor:

               There is a meeting scheduled for 2 :00 pm with Mayor Homaday . His main transportation issue is probably the
               one-time reduction in ferry service that starts in December , 2008, when the Tustemena goes into drydock for
               extensive repairs. AMHS has scheduled the Kennecott to provide backup service but there will be a reduction in
               the amount of service. The Kennecott is the only other Ocean Certified vessel that can replace the Tustemena
               but it costs twice as much to operate . ($420,000 a week ) and the Homer run only generates about $50,000 a
               week in revenue. AMHS decided that given the costs , etc., the proposed level of backup service provided by the
               Kennecott was reasonable . Mayor Homaday probably disagrees.

               Other local officials like the City Manager of Kodiak , Linda Freed, have said they are happy with any amount of
               backup service when the Tustemena goes down because prior to 1998 when the Kennecott was built, they used
               to get no backup service.
