         Sorry this took awhile to track down. The attached is an explanation of the two items you
         asked about, deployment of the AANG and the August 30 funeral service.



         In short this office was not informed of the deployment of the 15 members from the AANG to
         Afghanistan



         We regretted the funeral because this is a monthly ceremony that the base does and was not
         specific to any one individual that was killed in action. These ceremonies's occurs once a
         month and this one in particular was for the active duty Army component not for the ANG
         troops.



         Mike
