           Sure. And glad the public can now tour it- since 9-11 it's been off-limits for public
           tours, now we can see it again.

           Governor-



           Channel 11 would like your thoughts on the port tour today. May I tell them you look
           forward to the expansion project and the positive economic impacts this will have on the
           state?
     I


           Apparently - someone gave Channel 11 amateur video of the tour - they were not out there.
