           sadness at the loss of Brig Gen Tom Tinsley, 3rd Wing/CC and a good friend to

           Alaska.    Please include a short quote from Governor Palin which specifically

           mentions her condolences for the family and a quote from me concerning the

           great relationship between the Air Force and the Air National Guard that Brig

           Gen Tinsley had fostered.



           Need to get this one out in the next couple of hours. Please run it through

           Mr. Cramer.



            Thanks
