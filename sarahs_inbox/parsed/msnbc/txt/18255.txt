          Dear Mr. Rhode:




          Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and encouraging
          response to my administration's action regarding SB 53, the FY2008 Capital Budget.



          I have heard from many Alaskans that they are excited and hopeful that we can get spending
          under control, manage our revenues and resources efficiently, and cut wasteful spending.



          I am working with my commissioners on developing the FY2009 budget to meet my budget goals
          to control spending, live within our means, and save for the future.



          I appreciate hearing from you!



          Sincerely,



          Sarah Palin

         Governor

         for selection was right on. While it would appear that there are disappointments in every
         corner of the state , this aggressive budget management is exactly what we have needed and
         reflects what the voters have asked for. Keep up the oversight.
