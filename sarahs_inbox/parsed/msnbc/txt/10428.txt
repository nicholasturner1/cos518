              Wanted to let you know I just got a phone message from Jim Bowles that they had a leak on
              a flow line at Kuparuk. He said he feels it is under control and contained, his man has
              contacted Jonne, and he just wanted to communicate with us. I already called Bruce. As
              we get more details Bruce will let us.know. Tom
