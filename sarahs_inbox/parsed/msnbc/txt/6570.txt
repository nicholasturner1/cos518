             The only real reason for the Juneau day next week is the Juneau Superior Court interviews. I almost hate
             to say it but we can work something out that would be easier than flying in Tuesday morning and flying
             out Tuesday night.

             Ok. But next week will be a bear trying to get to Juneau (instead of today and tomorrow) with Todd on the slope.
             I'm not sure who's scheduling next wk's Juneau appts, but the ideal is for Juneau mtgs to take place when todd is
             home - so he can take the kids. Don't want to be picky about it, but the schedule should ideally reflect my work in
             Anchorage when todd's on slope, Juneau when he's in wasilla. Almost a week-on, week-off sched until next
             semester starts when the girls can be with me in Juneau.

             Confidential be people gossip too much about my sched already. Thanks!

            IT get the kids in school today, then, unless Tibbles is already in Anchorage for our ppt mtgs tomorrow, I need to
            get to Juneau tonight and spend the day there tomorrow. (Otherwise I won't get there again until next week.)
