  Subject : October - JNU Dinner/Game
  Governor - I spoke with the Juneau Football Coach - Bill Chalmers this afternoon. Mr. Chalmers would
  like you and the family to be the "Honorary Coaches" for the Saturday evening 8:00 pm. play off game.
  You would all be recognized and be able to stand at the side lines with the coaches. Mr. Chalmers also
  asked if the dinner could be Friday night instead of Thursday. We would like to bring you down on
  Thursday so that you could speak to the Alaska Travel Industry Association Annual Convention. I am
  asking for an afternoon speaking time. This includes 500 Tourism Leaders throughout the state. Friday
  would be meetings here in the Juneau office with the football dinner that evening from 7:30 p.m. - 8:30
  p.m. at the Mansion. Saturday would be the play-off game. Then Sunday you would travel back to
  Anchorage on morning or afternoon flight. Another family consideration for Juneau would be to view the
  HUB youth center. Pastor Rose is asking for a letter of endorsement for the HUB project, to be used in
  their fund raising efforts. (We have one drafted for you). Thank you for your consideration, Janice
