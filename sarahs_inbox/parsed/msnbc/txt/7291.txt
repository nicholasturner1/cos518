          Fyi - mat maid situation is a mess . And being denied the tour is an odd

          thing to have just faced . Hmmmmm. Mr . Tibbles, et al, will help us get

          to the bottom of this. And I will be replacing the board asap . As soon

          as I know the proper steps to do so via Tibbles and ivy.

         Mr. Tibbles:

         Waited as long as we could for my noon tour of Mat Maid           - VanTryck never

         showed up though he knew we were there. He was the only one " authorized"

         to let us tour .      Kris was communicating with him for over two hrs trying

         to track him down - this was amazing.



         Rumors running are that VanTryck has been working on a set up deal to

         bring the water bottling back on line with him as owner / operator. Other

         rumors have to do with his very golden parachute ,        thus his and the

         board's hesitency to release contract and other info I need to get to

         the bottom of the issue here.



         Bottom line - he submitted a letter of resignation that the bd still

         hasn't accepted. Mat Maid's management appears to have run the business

         in the ground without fair notification given the entity's owner (the

         state).
                                                            2

          We stuck our neck out asking legislators for the funds to keep this

          running while a plan was put in place - as requested by MatMaid - then

          they ripped that opportunity out from under us, the farmers, all

         Alaskans, and he decides to resign before the closure "emergency".



          I need an investigation of this entity' s management asap because this is

          a cluster and certainly there's got to be a consideration of malfeasance

         on someone 's part here. Businesses don't just go belly-up overnight.



          Farmers are holding their breath, counting on us to help. MatMaid dumped

          a nuclear situation on our lap.



         Does the board have attorneys working for members and VanTryck -

         protecting them and their information - from the AG's office or the

         private sector? I hear they do have attorneys from somewhere on board.
