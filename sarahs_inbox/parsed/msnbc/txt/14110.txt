            Hi guys: do you know what time Hse or Senate meets today? Wondering if I should get things
            done around here before heading over to the office.



            Nice editorial in the ADN today, pointing out the posturing of leggies re: Sp Session and
            their request for expanded call.



            Talked to a reporter on Friday's return flt to Juneau - he said he's hearing Senate
            intends to gavel out on Friday, with or without House ' s completion of work. Does that mean
            the House finishes up when they need to, and it' s an assumed concurrence by the Senate on
            the final product then?
