            They will meet you at the reception - they know you will be arriving                approx. 10 min.
            early.  Janice

            Is there a location set up for me to meet this Shell CEO here in the Cpt Cook? I'm headed
            in now - I'll be in the lobby until I hear where I'm supposed to go.
