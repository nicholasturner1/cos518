              Subject:                Request for Input for 2008 ECS National Forum




              Dear Governor Palin:

              As your state liaison to ECS, I'm writing to encourage you to mark your

              calendar for the 2008 ECS National Forum on Education Policy, June 30-July

              2, in Austin, Texas, and to ask for your input. This year, to make the

              meeting as relevant to our constituents as possible, we are asking our

              commissioners to share key issues that you are currently facing in Alaska

              that you would like addressed at the ECS National Forum.




              Your suggestions will directly impact the topics and discussion themes that

              will be woven throughout the Forum program. Please forward your ideas to

             me by close of business on October 26. Thanks very much.
