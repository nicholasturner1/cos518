           When I learned the impact of making the polar bear an endangered species, I thought if I
           was governor of Alaska, I'd be talking about seceding from the United States!




           I hope that your lawsuit with the US will change the polar bears ' status. I am at a loss
           for what is happening to our country... I am beginning to think our congress is selling
           our country out for their own benefit.




           Congratulations on your new          baby. We know five families who have down syndrome children
           and each one would say that         their down syndrome child brought special blessing to each
           member of their family. (In         our case, our neighbors son, Joe, is like a brother to our
           sons - and even though they         are all adults, they still get together for special football
           games!)
