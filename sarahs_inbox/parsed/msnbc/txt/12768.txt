             Fyi forgot to tell you Sharon that I met her in the seattle airport returning from DC. I
             appreciated that she was bold enough to come ontroduce herself, tell me she's still
             interested in working for our admin, etc. Just fyi for u to keep in mind if Privll s gig
             doesn't work out and/or we need admin support in Communications office for Anc orage. Beth
             and her gal can be in Juneau, sounds like... So let's concentrate on filling any and all
             Comm needs in Anchorage, as that's where everyone is nearly 300 days of the year. We won't
             worry about having enough resources for more in Anchorage office, we can squuze folks in,
             and our Gov's office has enough $ as we switch Security funds and positions into Comm line
             items. Thanks
