           Governor,



           Tomorrow is the deadline for budget amendment to the House Finance Committee. The
           subcommittee reports are in and now is the typical time that the administration submits
           requests to the committee for reconsideration of problematic budget reductions .  Right now
           it looks like there was approximately $ 100 million reduced from our amended budget. This
           includes the $7 million for fish and game to replace federal funds , nearly $5 million for
           the BP corrosion lawsuit , quite a bit out of health and social services and even the
           university.



           I wanted to run a strategy by you.         Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
