             My family wishes you the best wishes on your new little blessing.  God has given you a
             very special angel and I know that he is in such good hands. Your husband had such a
             sweet loving look on his face and you were so quick to Thank God for what you have. Your
             family will be blessed many times as will we, the people of Alaska for having a Governor
             so willing to even speak the name of our creator. Many blessings and best wishes. Joan
