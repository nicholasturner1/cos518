  Subject : King Air Availability - December Return
 Governor - I spoke w/Gary earlier today and he mentioned that the King Air will be available to return you
 and family to Anchorage the morning of December 15 (Saturday). If you would like they can return you all
 on December 14 (Friday) evening after the Open House. The Open House will be done @ approx. 6:30 -
 7:00 p.m. If you got out by 8:00 p.m. you would be in Anchorage by 10:00 p.m. Please let me know if this
 is what you would prefer to do. Thanks, Janice
