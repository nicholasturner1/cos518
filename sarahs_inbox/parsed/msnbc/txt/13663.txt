           Governor:



           One thing we may be able to do to help our soldiers (that at least one

           other state) has done is donate old cell phones and blackberries to

            "Cell Phones for Soldiers".        They take the old phones, give them to a

           recycler, and use the payment from the recycler to buy prepaid calling

           cards for troops to call their families while overseas.



           Linda / Annette:



           Any thoughts?



           Randy
