                 I looked last night, too. It's the same 10 people over and over again, including Ridle. I love how they
                 suggested that one of my press people could do a blog. Obviously, they think we're still part of the
                 Murkowski admin and have 8 wandering around, instead of the two right now.

                 Meg -

                 Shoot. I made the mistake of looking at the ADN blog to find out about today's "Sarah Palin the
                 Blogger" issue ... I knew I shouldn't have looked through it!

                 The first entry I looked at was a slam of you or your answer to the blog issue. The rant sounded
                 familiar - like someone we may know. It was ridiculous and offensive.

                 The other entry I looked at was a question about my ethics... it said I was trying to get my
                 "Dad's best friend the deputy job at F & G". (Obviously referring to the Mat-Su guy, Corey
                 Rossi, whom a lot of game guys were lobbying for - my dad passed on a few comments from
                 guys he was hearing from that were favorable to Corey.) I just called my dad, he confirmed that
                  1.) Corey Rossi is not his best friend 2.) he's not lobbying for anything for Corey, he was passing
                 on comments from Alaskans who wanted to make sure I heard their input 3.) he would never try
                 to sway me to hire anyone 4.) he knows I'm not micromanaging Denby and the choice of
                 Denby's teammembers is in Denby's hands.

                 It was another offensive blog entry.

                 And it sure leaves me puzzled as to the rumors that are able to spread like wildfire. Kind of
                 makes my stomach turn over.

                 Looking at that blog was also my reminder to NOT waste my time and energy peeking at it to
                 find out what's on readers' minds.

                 Tibbles - where is Denby on putting together his F & G team? Until he gets his deputy(ies) in
                 there, we'll keep hearing controversy re: who's doing what.
