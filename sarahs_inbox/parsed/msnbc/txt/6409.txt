          We'll keep leading by example - surprised anyone would even ask if they could book full
          fare - they need to be efficient with use of public funds. And I'd hope they already knew
          that.

          Subject: First Class travel




          Governor:



         I may have misunderstood, and perhaps read more into the situation early on, but it seemed
         you made a statement about not flying first class and I believed you wanted commissioners
         to take that to heart.



         With that in mind, and with the following statute, I need some policy direction from you.
         I have bolded the most relevant parts, but you need to read it in context, of course.



         Sec. 39.20.140. Travel costs and travel outside the state.

         (a) The Department of Administration may not pay an official or employee for per diem or
         transportation costs unless the travel is clearly necessary to benefit the state.

         (b) The Department of Administration may not reimburse an official or employee or pay for
         more than the lowest tourist class fare for the most direct route unless

          (1) tourist class accommodation is not available;

         (2)   waiting for tourist class accommodation would occasion a delay harmful to the state;
         or

         (3) the Department of Administration finds that travel by tourist class accommodation is
         not in the best interest of the state, and authorizes other accommodation.

         (c) When the Department of Administration authorizes more expensive travel under (b)(3) of
         this section, it shall file a justification for that authorization with the travel
                                                                  1



                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0003540

          voucher. when fares other than tourist class are authorized under (b) of this section, the
          Department of Administration may not reimburse the official or employee or pay for more
          than the lowest first class fare available.

          (d) Officials and employees are authorized to travel only the least number of days
          necessary to transact the business involved, to secure return passage, and to return.

           (e) Every official and employee shall, unless otherwise authorized by law to travel
          outside the state, obtain prior approval for travel outside the state from the head of the
          official's or employee's department or from an immediate supervisor, or from the
          Department of Administration if the official or employee is not within a department or is
          not under the direct supervision of an official or supervisor. If an employee deviates
          materially from the travel authorized under this section, the employee must obtain
          approval for the deviation from the person who approved the travel before the Department
          of Administration may reimburse the employee for the travel.

          Sec. 39.20.160. Regulations.

          The fixing and payment under AS 39.20.110 - 39.20.170 of travel and per diem allowances
          and of advances and recovery and reimbursement of travel expenses shall be in accordance
          with regulations adopted by the commissioner of administration. The regulations shall be
          uniform for all officials and employees, and all agencies and departments. The regulations
          shall also govern the use of public transportation facilities by officials and employees.
          The regulations relate to the internal management of state agencies and their adoption is
          not subject to AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).



         When I fly coach, I have been telling people (it comes up) that since the Governor flies
         coach, the Commissioners fly coach.  Apparently, this is not the case. I have a request
         from one department in front of me for the commissioner, Deputy and another employee to
         have all flights booked full fare so that they can be upgraded to first class .  As I read
         the above statute, that is inconsistent. It also seems inconsistent with the appearance
         you have tried hard to give of us not being "government insiders." It is difficult to
         travel frequently, I'm sure you are well aware, but I don't think it gives us a "right" to
         be in first class seats as a result of booking full coach fares.

         We all need the tools to do our jobs and there are some who have medical issues who might
         need a first class seat, but in general, when we all fly first class, I have to ask what
         that says to the other Alaskans on the plane.

         If you want Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners to get waivers for upgrades, I will
         sign them, but just need a little guidance here.
