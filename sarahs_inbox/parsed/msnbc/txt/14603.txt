          Governor - I just received a phone call from Jim Bowles office. Mr. Bowles is requesting
          to speak with you via phone before 9:20 a.m. today, Wed., 04.30.08. They have two
          announcements that they will be making at 10:00 a.m. and wanted to make sure you knew
          before the public announcement.  Mr. Bowles can be reached via his cell Privile ed or we can
          set up a call for afternoon (but announcement will have been made). Janice
