                 Subject: Community Health Centers
                It is abundantly clear to many of us who work in health care that a significant number of
                Alaskans are very marginalized when it comes to health care and even access to health care.,

                This includes the "working poor", homeless people, the non-working poor, seniors across the
                state, children who fall through the gaps in coverage, those people that some health care
                providers just don't want to see anymore, and those with no insurance.

                It is clear that emergency departments are not the answer to this health unavailability.

                Community Health Centers can provide a most important interim management in the short haul
                until something can be done about access to health care and universal coverage. I worked at the
                first Neighborhood Health Center when it was created in Anchorage and have been involved
                with this modality of care over the years. I strongly support this access to health care and ask
                that you give your focused attention and support for this funding.

                Thank you for this consideration.
