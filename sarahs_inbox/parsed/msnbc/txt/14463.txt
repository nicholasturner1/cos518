          MESSAGE:

          Governor Palin:

          Congratulations on the birth of your son, Trig. My wife and I have had 11 children and
          each one has been a special blessing.

          I wish that this were all that I had to write, but certain state employees have created a
          problem for me that has recently cost me my position as the Radiologist for Wrangell
          Medical Center.
