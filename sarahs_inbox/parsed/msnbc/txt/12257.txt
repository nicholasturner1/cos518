            I think a quick confidential call from me giving Steve a heads up that he will be your
            choice would be a good idea so Steve doesn't worry that he continues to be tied up in a
            bureaucratic process.  Also as long as you agree we want to let him know DNR will help him
            and work with him all we can.



            Will also stress to Steve this is just notice and formal announcement must come from you
            and the board. Tom

            Do you want to inform Steve of our pick of him for Energy? I won't wait on the letter from
            Emil, as it may take a couple of days to get here, I'm told - and my understranding is the
            letter's content says he was top candidate and they await my confirmation of their pick.



            It's all good.
