            Janice and I have continued to research this and she has now found that the letter was
            rec'd in March and forwarded to Joe since it had something to do w / gas pipeline hire. I
            spoke w / Joe and he said he asked Jessica to forward to scheduling and B and C since it
            touched more on those. He's not sure of the status of that forward and will check
            w/Jessica tomorrow. Unfortunately Janice could not (initially) find it in the tracking
            system which is what I firmly relayed to Dr. Green. I was - albeit professional - ticked.



            Janice will get a copy for you tomorrow.



            All that being said and aside from the communication issue, we have worked with these
            folks: attending the African American Summit, Dan is a member of NAACP; they are reaching
            out and I know they've made some recent appointments. I met with Mayfield today and told
            him that we'd have staff at their upcoming scholarship meeting and he didn't even give me
            a heads up about this.
