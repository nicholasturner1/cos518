                  Dear Governor Palin,

                  I have asked Toby Keith to produce a video with me , True North Video Productions , LLC, for the 50th
                  anniversary of statehood for Alaska . Nothing is more appropriate in my humble opinion than Johnny
                  Horton ' s North to Alaska.

                  So you think I am sending you this email about money, no as a matter of fact that is not the entire case B,
                  I think you would make a fine Jenny and hope you would consider making a cameo as Jenny?

                  Please contact me, Mr. Keith has not agreed to this idea at this point in time, your interest might
                  encourage him to consider this opportunity.

                  Gunalcheesh
