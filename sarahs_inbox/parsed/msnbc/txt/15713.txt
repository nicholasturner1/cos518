         MESSAGE:

         I know that you've said that you don't want to run as VP but I wish that you would
         reconsider.  You are precisely what the Republican party and more importantly, the
         American people need in the white house. The thought of an Obama/Clinton regime is
         absolutely frightening and without someone like you as McCain's running mate, that's
         exactly what we are going to get. PLEASE reconsider.
