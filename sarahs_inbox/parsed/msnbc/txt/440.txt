Hi Todd-- right now we don't have a schedule for June , so this can sure work if you and the Governor
want it to . I will get it into scheduling so she/you can look at the whole month before you confirm
anything. Kari.

Kari,



I'm not sure what the Governors schedule is for the

26th,) think she would like to go depending on her

schedule.
