              He was a regular attendee, and those he was outside for he called in for.

                Governor.

                I just got off the phone with Meghan Stapleton. She is sending an addendum about the rural trips that
                mentions those trips we know occurred that she has been able to confirm. Do you want to see this before I
                send it on to Megan Holland? Or, as Megban has suggested, can I send it in a new seperate e-mail to
                Megan?

                Thank you. Best if has mayor porter and manager koch with him. He MUST be candid, honest and must
                ask to be held accountable because he has nothing to hide as he tells truthfully of the situation ... is my
                opinion based on what I've been told. I have no reason to NOT believe him based on info I am aware of...
                now Alaskans need to hear clearly why he is to be believed. Solid and strong and truthful. (I hope he
                realizes how bad some folks want to crucify us - he needs to be strong. )

    I          Here is my understanding about the press conference tomorrow scheduled for 2:00 at public safety.

               It began with the 5:00 channel 2 news cast Jason Moore reported that they had uncovered a memo from the
    1          City of Kenai written by the city attorney indicating that when the allegation/complaint came into the
               department the city removed Chuck from all supervisory duties. They made it quite sinister as you can
               expect like there is still something that he and the city was hiding.

                I called Chuck immediately after the news segment was over and asked if he could walk through this with
               me. Bottom line is he was already at his attorney's office and on the phone with the City of Kenai attorney's
               office working on a strategy.

               The city did what any responsible employer would do in the situation. Its a human resource response when
               you have any allegations made about any of your employees as it relates to sexual harassment, you remove
               immediately the person from the any of supervisory duties (in this situation Chuck directly supervised this
               woman) until you can substantiate or unsubstantiated the claim. In this case they could not substantiate the
               claim and eventually Chuck returned to normal duties.

                Chuck is having a press conference tomorrow to end this situation by going public with what he can and
                set the record straight. He will have the city Mayor b y his side and she will attest to the situation in favor of
                Chuck. Privileged or Personal Material Redacted
                Privilege or ersona
                That is what is going on. They were working on the statement for tomorrow and he will call me in the
                morning with some more follow up.

                My understanding, just based on short convo with Kris, is that Kopp got an attorney and is going to hold a
                press conf to defend himself and explain the allegations from a kenai woman? And the kenai mayor will be
                standing with him? If there are any details I need to hear them- like when this will take place, what
                prompted this new action, etc.
                 He does need to take all action, solidly, to dispel any untruths out there, asap. I've had very good
                Alaskans say that this is NOT a good situation he's in.
