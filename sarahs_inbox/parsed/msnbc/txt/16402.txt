           Not yet, but I can only imagine what it says and am absolutely sick (not to mention
           pissed). I'm going to call Faircount, after all the frustration dealing w/this company
           they can step up to the plate and also deal w/this crap and get the truth out there.

           I'll defer to Mike/Janice on that as I do not know.



           I spoke w/Joe last night and he is working on rescheduling the 10:30am mtg in Barrow so
           you can leave Wasilla at 9am. I'm waiting to hear back and will let everyone know as soon
           as I do.

             Did linda Perez say we'd have to pay for Barrow ' s jet to be allowed seats on it tomorrow?
             How much will it cost the state to reimburse them if we fly their aircraft?
