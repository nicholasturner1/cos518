          MESSAGE:,

          Dear Governor Palin,




          I have lived in Alaska since 1976 and have worked in the aviation business until my
          retirement this year.




          I have acouple of ideas that could help Alaska's seniors and still be cost effective.




          Please consider the following administrative actions:




                                                                1




                                                                                                           PRA GSP01_0022842

          1)  The State could issue Seasonal Senior Passes to the State Park System .  These passes
          could allow residents age 62 or older free or reduced fees for parking and camping. The
          State of Florida has an existing program that might serve as a guideline.




          2)  The former University of Alaska program that provided Alaska's seniors free tuition on
          a space available basis, was a good idea that could not have cost much .  This program
          could be reinstated.




          Legislative Ideas that would cost the State:




          1)  The Legislature could look at property tax relief as a form of future revenue sharing
          that . could be targeted towards Alaska ' s seniors . The City of Anchorage had a good senior
          program that was cancelled a few years ago.




          Thank you for your time and all the positive changes you have made in Juneau.




          Sincerely,




          Allan Jones
