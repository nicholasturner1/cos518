   Ivy,
   Thank you for considering me for the "Regents, University of Alaska Board of'. At this
   time, I am not interested in this appointment. Ivy, please express my appreciation to
   Sarah for consideration. This is not the right position at this particular time.
   I do wish to "Serve" Alaska in some capacity in the future. Sarah is going to be an
   awesome Gov. and if I can work in a way to help complete her vision, I would be happy
   to do so. I would consider other assignments in the future, should there be a need.
   Good luck to you Ivy. You have been very informative, thorough and cordial in
   sharing information regarding the potential appointment. Thank you for the job you are
  doing.
