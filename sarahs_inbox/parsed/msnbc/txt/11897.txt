            I don't understand .   I thought everybody was on board with Privileged ( all 3 commissioners,
            Frank , Marty , me, Mike Black ). Does this need to be so comp l icated? Why would the board
            proceed in this inefficient way without consulting with the workgroup?

              The AIDEA/AEA board voted to hire a search firm. They put out a quick

              RFP.     The contract should be signed this week and names should come in

              soon.
