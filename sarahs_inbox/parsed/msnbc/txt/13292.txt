             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on the arrival of Trig Paxson Van Palin. We are blessed to have a 15 year
             old son with Down Syndrome and I can't imagine what life would be like without him. He's
             added fun, challenges, lots of love, a reason , to slow down, lots of friends we wouldn't
             have had otherwise, introduction to Special Olympics, lots of joy, and maybe a few gray
             hairs!!!  I appreciate so much your positive attitude and your acknowledgement that his
             creator is the same as the rest of ours ! We pray God will bless you and encourage you as
             he grows up and develops. Your older children are going to be the best thing for him.
             Enjoy a new journey of which many of us are a part. The Lord is with you on this
             wonderful journey.
