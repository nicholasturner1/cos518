            Subject:                   Update on Rock Creek Mine in Nome

            Governor, Mike,

             FYI.   DNR just learned that earlier today the federal Corp of Engineers

             "pulled " their recently issued         ( late Summer 2006 )   404 Wetlands Fill

            Permit from the Rock Creek Mine .           Rock Creek Mine is located near Nome

             (with two pit locations )         and is a midsize open pit gold mine. it is

            similar in size to the True North and Illinois Creek gold mines. Rock

            Creek is owned by Alaska Gold which is now a subsidiary company of

            NovaGold , which is a Canadian mining company .             NovaGold purchased Alaska

            Gold within the past few years .          Alaska Gold is an old - time Nome gold

            company and is the largest private landowner in the area .                 The state and

            the feds just completed the permitting process on this . mine.                 The

            project will eventually employ over 100 people and last for

            approximately 5 years .       At this juncture the project was just beginning

            to be constructed and I am unaware of the size of the current workforce.



            I am advised that a recently organized environmental group sued the

            federal Corp of Engineers on the 404 permit because a full EIS

            (Environmental Impact Statement )         was not completed .      Instead they did an

            EA (Environmental Assessment ), which is typically done for a project of

            this size .    The full EIS process adds years and millions of dollars of

            cost to a project ,     and in this instance would probably have killed the

            economics of the mine .        The environmental organization was asking the

            courts for an injunction but the courts never ruled on the question as

            the Corp took an administrative action to pull the permit .                 Thus the

            project is now stalled.




            I wanted you to have some baseline information on this Corp of Engineers

            action in case you are asked .          It is also possible you will be asked if

                                                                    1

            you intend to intervene in the litigation, on behalf of the mine. If

            you are interested in considering this option I will get some additional

            information pulled together for your consideration and involve the

            appropriate attorney(s) at the Dept of Law.
