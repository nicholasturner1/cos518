         I called Pat. We read through Sherry's blog entries from yesterday together. They are so
         hateful and hurtful. He said he banned her once already. Her husband asked that she be
         allowed back on and that she'd behave. Pat agrees the entries are over the top, he said to
         ask people to "flag" the ones that are lies or whatever- he was very nice about ti, but
         said they don't have time to censor all this - I said I don't have time either. Todd may
         call Sherry or Tom and ask them why they lie like they do.

            I think our security guys should check into her because the times she's blogged about
         Todd's schedule and what we drive have really infringed on our privacy rights and
         potential safety when psychos know when Todd's out of town.

         Ok dokay- enough is enough. I am calling ADN, as Todd just called from Dlg and said Sherry
         Whitstine (aka crazy hater) blogged yesterday that "Sarah had an affair with Todd's best
         friend while he was on the slope". No, I haven't read it- others have - it's flippin
         unbelievable that the ADN allows lies like this to be posted. I'm calling.
