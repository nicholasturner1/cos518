          I need the speech as soon as possible this morning , hopefully in near-final form. I want
          AGIA communications folks to edit it and to make sure our message is consistent,
          energetic , and meshes with the iogcc participants ' agenda . Thanks



          If it ' s not complete , pls send it to me anyway be I want to hustle on this
