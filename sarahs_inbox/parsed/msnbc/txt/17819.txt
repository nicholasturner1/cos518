             Subject: FYI- Telephone Switch over Thurs. 5/10 (Cisco IP)

           Hello,

           This Thursday at 2:00pm. the House will switch over to the new Cisco IP phones. These are the same phones
           used in the Anchorage offices, but we're the first location in Juneau to have them installed. I think we will also
           have wireless capabilities for the computers on Thursday.

           Where would you like the wireless phone (only 1) upstairs? If I don't hear back I'll put it in the master bedroom.

           Most of the intercom numbers will stay the same, but you'll have a new list on the phones. I can run through the
           basics of the "how tos" with the girls and make a cheat sheet to leave by the phones. There's also a hand out that
           will be under the phones.

           Finally, the House will have decent phones instead of ones that are one step above the rotary dial!
           Erika
