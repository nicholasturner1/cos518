             My understanding is that you were committed to this before Kelly joined us...she can give
             you more detail than I.



             Please let me know if you have any questions about any of the tomorrow's events . I am
             available by Blackberry for the rest of the evening.

             We've not done this before - signing ceremonial after the fact. We've ceremonially signed
             BEFORE we had the bill in hand, but isn't this an odd way of doing this? Kinda' double-
             dipping after the previous ceremony where the Bethel students participated with the
             lawmakers already?
