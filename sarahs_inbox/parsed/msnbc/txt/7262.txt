        Governor,

         I'm glad you were able to meet with Marathon. Kevin Banks and I called Marathon last
        night and set up the LNG Export License follow-up meeting for this coming week. It will
        be at the staff level to determine if the state and the companies can find "common
        ground" on the three conditions. Late this week DNR and the A.G.'s Office met together to
        discuss what specific actions by the companies would meet our three conditions and how to
        respond to the concerns we've heard from the companies. We also wanted to ensure DNR and
        the A.G.'s office were in agreement on the flexibility the state has going into the
        "negotiations" with Marathon and CP.  Kevin Banks tells me he thinks we have identified
        reasonable ways of meeting our needs that will convey flexibility to the companies, so
        I'm hopeful we can find ways to meet the state's needs and yet respond to the commercial
        concerns voiced by Marathon and CP. The goal s being to convey Alaska is open for
        business,  reasonable, and yet protects our citizens energy needs.

        I hope you received the e-mail I sent yesterday regarding phone calls to the three
        Producer CEO's.  If you did not, I also copied Mike Tibbles and Meghan. Have an
        enjoyable, and safe, trip.

       Marty R
