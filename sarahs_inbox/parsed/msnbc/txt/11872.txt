             He is a sinful liar. He's got to be called on this - I'm not going to keep on letting his
             be be ignored and even accepted. Sharon and Beth need to help on this too, to communicate
             with mainstream media that they're discredited when they go to Halcro as a legit source.



             Who could have even spread that lie to Halcro? Bitney? Anyone else around here?

            I have never "shuttled" kids to school on state time-or any other time. Anybody who
            knows anything knows the governor takes her kids to school by herself or with security
            every flippin' day. Anytime I hang out with you and your family it's because I want to!
            This guy is a LIAR! I am ticked! I'm calling him on the flippin' carpet. I'm glad he's
            given me a reason to take the gloves off!
