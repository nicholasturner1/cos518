           Governor,  I felt bad that you had to ask about Reeves and AIDEA.  You should know that I
           have regularly discussed these with the COS. Also, on the potential land trespass issue,
           that was to be a simple, personal informational discussion directly by the COS with you
           before your travel, not by email. I will be more aware to keep you up to date on these
           things.   Tom
