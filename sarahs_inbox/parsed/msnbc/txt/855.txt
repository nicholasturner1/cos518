  Hi Todd,

  Randy asked if we want to have Pam Knapp (or someone not coming into regular contact with lobbyists)
  start calling them . There' s a list of lobbyists from the APOC website and I could ask her ( I could help too)
  to get started if you think that's a good idea.

  Chuck Collins from Copy Express is taking 10 tickets to try and sale.

  We were able to take down all of the decorations; the House was ready for the lunch and the press event
  this afternoon.

  Thanks,
  Erika
