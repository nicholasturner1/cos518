              Governor , for lack of nothing more original or inspiring to say , you're awesome! We
              support you and Alaska supports you.



              I'm truely ashamed of the senate president and to have worked for her. Tonight I've lost
              any respect I had left .  Never in my wildest dreams could I think anyone would make a
              person pick between addressing their state or honoring their only son as he graduates from
              boot camp and will go on to be a great defender of our country . I'm really just sickened
              by the abuse of power . I'm with Kris and Frank - send her a flippin ' dvd in the mail-she'd
              be lucky to even get a copy-she sure as heck doesn ' t deserve the honor of seeing your
              address in person.

               And tell Track we love 'em and thanks for serving our country.

              What next? What a way to kick things off...



              I really cannot believe this situation. I pray that what the enemy means for evil, will
              turn out for good.
