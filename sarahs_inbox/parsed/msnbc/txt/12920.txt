               Dear Governor Palin-

               Just wanted to send you a quick note and thank you for the appointment to the North Pacific Fishery
               Management Council.

               It is most definitely an honor, and if the Secretary of Commerce approves the nomination, I look forward
               to working with your administration on the fisheries issues that are so important to our state.

               Again thank you so much,
               Eric Olson
