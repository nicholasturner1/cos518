          All,



          I just got off the phone with Kelly and the LG is happy to cover the event - if he can get
          out of FBX in time. He's stranded there right now.



          Should I call the event contact and cancel for the Govan with the LG as a hopeful backup?

          Last we heard it was still on but will be held indoors and they won't be on motorcycles.
          But with the heavy snow warnings that will affect turnout.

          Do we know if tomorrow's motorcycle event is canceled? If roads are bad I'm not driving
          in- esp if not many participants are there.
