            Good morning, Governor.



            Attached is the forum speech that should last roughly 25 minutes.



            Kurt and Bruce have reviewed and marked it. This speech is in its final form from us. As
            you will see, Thursday's speech was the foundation for this speech and much of the basis
            of the Forum speech comes from the press conference remarks. Where this speech differs is
            in the expansion of the details to address some of the critics over the last few days in a
            very positive way.



            Do not hesitate to repeat yourself. This speech should sound more like your State of the
            State address in that this is the first time many in the public, including legislators,
            will hear your words directly from you and not deciphered through the media. This speech
            will reach not only those here in town, but throughout our state, including in our rural
            villages.  This is the first time in awhile that many will hear you speaking about this so
            you want to make sure that the whole package is there and explained thoroughly for those
            watching.  Additionally, this is the speech that will be recorded for historical purposes
            and so a complete picture for those purposes is important as well.


                                                                 1




                                                                                                            P RA_GS P01 _0018329
