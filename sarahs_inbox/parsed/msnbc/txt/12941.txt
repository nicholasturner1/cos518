            Pls add yesterday 4pm visited APOC office, met staff members.



            Noon- visited Div of Elections, met staff members. Spoke with various reporters. (Also
            conducted interviews at 10am).



            1-3:30 met on gasline issues.



            Eliminate 7pm intriduction last night (they changed the agenda and I wouldn't have even
            begun the comments until 8:30-ish... The day was long enough without staying in Anchorage
            through the extended evening).



            Today: I'll conduct ADN interview with Wesley Loy re: budget and gasline.
