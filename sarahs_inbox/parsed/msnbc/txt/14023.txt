             What's up with TC refusing to go on camera - not even willing to answer questions of
             leggies if KTUtJ's camera was present - darn it, that's a top story now and was reported by
             Ramras. We need to respond by the 6pm news.

             If we do press avail tomorrow in Anchorage, then Rhonda should join us to speak of
            impacts in rural and how committed we are to helping with energy needs.
