            MESSAGE:

            Dear Mrs. Palin,




            To be short and to the point, I like your views and the stance you have taken on issues
            important to me, I believe that you are the only hope for the next presidential election
            not to go Democratic, My thinking is that you could inherit alot of the youthful
            enthusiasm that has been stirred up by Obama, you seem to have the ability to get-things
            done. I sincerely hope that John McCain can see what you could bring to the table and
            picks you as his running mate . If he doesn't, thanks anyway for standing up for what
            America should be. I am actually a registed democrat, but can't vote that way anymore.
            Best wishes to you and your family. Thank you.
