           Mike - sorry to bug you again, but who was answering the letter? And Cora informs me we -
           incl the dept of law- have been investigating this Penney/Stevens issue since "I" received
           the letter? Are you aware of that?

          Im reading today's article, ADN, about Penney' s earmark from Stevens - it says the
          governor received a letter Sept 14 questioning the funds. Was that me , or was some letter
          sent Sept 14 during prior administration?



          Because i have not seen, nor heard about, any letter. In fact, except in passing when I
          heard Larry and Mike mention the ADN was on to another Stevens/Penney issue, I have never
          been informed nor privy to any info on this issue.

                                                                      3

          I feel I need to be informed of these issues that deal with the state and end up on the
          front page of the newspaper . Please , if that letter was sent to me, allow me to see it. I
          would think I'd be asked about this issue, and we're lucky I wasn't already asked when a
          couple of reporters stopped me last week for Stevens' issues/comments.
