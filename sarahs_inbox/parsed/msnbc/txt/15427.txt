          So carol' s request was from a YEAR ago? We've met with her in that year.



          And Karen did take care of Fran's concerns- UA was all taken care of. (I haven't heard
          that's she's been put off - I was told it was Carol and Begich taking issue with our
          process, so if I'm missing something there I need to know)



          And Begich asked to "meet on budget" - he did - he had 1.5 hrs with some of my top trusted
          budget advisors just a few days ago (while I was working on AGIA) to hear him out on his
          lobbying cries for more Anchorage money. And I've attended numerous events with him
          recently and never has he told me he had to talk to me about budget.

          Governor -

          I have checked through scheduling, etc. Carol Comeau has not called or corresponded in
          recent months to the JNU office requesting to meet with you on budget. We do have a
          letter dated August 2007 that Carol sent asking to meet with you and Mike Tibbles on
          Education Funding.  Mike was going to meet with Carol directly in this regards.



          When I was in Anchorage on Wed., 05.14.08 I let you know that Fran Ulmer had called asking
          to meet with you regarding budget and that Fran had been in contact with Karen several
          times.  Also, I sent an email on Fri., 05.16.08 to let you know that Mayor Begich had
                                                                 1




                                                                                                               PRA GSP01 0018145

          called and requested to meet on budget as he did not feel that you were getting the
          information you needed especially on the Wind Farm Project.  He is worried that he is
          going to get caught off-guard with your budget. Janice

          I have not heard anything definitive on this phone call- who gave you this info and did
          they say what specifically I am to talk about to Fentie?



         Also, did Carol Comeau ever ask for a mtg with me on budget? She and Begich were just on
         ktuu saying they couldn't get in to see me - I was just with Begich yesterday and he never
         mentioned needing to see me on the budget. And I've never seen a request from Carol. Did
         one come in? Because if it didn't I want our Comm folks to correct the ktuu story and
         Carol needs to be. called on this if she's not being truthful.
