             Are there any uniform or consistent concerns ? Or just an underlying caution?

             Speaking of updates, Cora and I hit about half of the leggies we need to hit for BOF.
             More meetings tomorrow, the presser's being drafted for a release of Tues morning (at
             Sharon's discretion).



             So far all I have spoken to are cautiously positive on our plan for the 3 slots.

            Ok- thanks for the update. I've been wondering where it was. I'm double/triple checking on
            the Earmarks op-ed piece too... things seem to fall into thin air and I don't hear about
            them unless I'm bugging folks to find out. I emailed Sharon and Beth on the Earmarks piece
            just a bit ago.
