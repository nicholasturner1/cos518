                   Subject: Christmas Eve Thank Yous

                 Governor,

                 Attached are seven pages worth of 'thank yous" from happy State employees who are so appreciative of your
                 thoughtful gesture to excuse them from work on Christmas Eve. Commissioner Kreitzer wanted to make sure you
                 saw all of the positive responses that have brightened the Christmas season for so many State employees
                 because of your giving spirit.

                 Incase you' re checking from your blackberry, I've pasted some of my favorites in this email.

                 Merry Christmas,

                 Ivy

                 THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! What a wonderful gift and so nicely said. You
                 have given us a great blessing . Merry Christmas to all of you too.- Cathy J. Kane

                 Tell Sarah we are all doing a happy dance! And thank you very much! -Gretchen Collier

                 God Bless You!!!! I've worked here since 1987 and this is a first. Thank you so much.-Janet

                 I wish that you would pass on to Governor Palin how extremely thoughtful this is, to know we
                 have leave ahead of time, and also the time given is very generous. I have worked for the
                 State for 22 years now and to my knowledge this is the first time such an announcement has
                 been made.
                 We appreciate your gift and the thoughts behind it..
                 Thank you
                 Lavonne Rhyneer
