             Governor - Thanks - those boys deserved it. I will make sure that these events are
             covered and that you get on earlier flight out of JNU on Sat.



             Rhonda - you should have copies of all requests and I will work with you early Mon. a.m.
             as there is the Sealaska one in JNU this week and others in ANC also. Janice

             J- my return from Juneau on Sat puts me in the valley after midnight (and that's if the
             flt is on time). Can a flight be found that gets Trig, Piper and me in earlier than that?

             J-   first, congrats on the boys state championship ! Awesome job Bears!!!



             I'm looking at sched for the days I'm in Juneau - there are a number of worthy events that
             Rhonda has commented on... since I can't make these rural-oriented events that week she is
             welcome and encouraged to go in my place. Pls make sure she's aware of the details of
             these invitations.  There are so many events all over the state these summer months, I
             really want our office represented at as many events all around the state as possible, not
             just in Juneau and Anchorage.



             For Rhonda's consideration this week to represent me, there's the Holy Cross event, the
             RurAL CAP event, Sealaska's event, and Chenega's event... plus others. Pls pass on to her.



             Also, events like Friday's big VFW event- I won't be back for it in Anchorage but want to
             make sure someone is there representing me.



             There are big events all over and I want to make sure we have someone at as many of them -
             esp the big ones - as possible.



             Attending as many as poss allows us to touch base w many communities and constituents as
             we seek boards and commission members also , as we seek community priority input, etc. If I
             can't be there pls run these invites by the LtGov so he's given the opportunity to attend
             also. Thanks
