             settlement planned for Thursday. I don't know where the "Mega" is. I will try to find

             We do intend to have press conference in the Mega at 9am on Thursday. BP will not be
             invited to attend.  This is just now taking shape so we have not sent notices. We would
             be pleased and honored to share the podium with you or Talis or the Governor. Please let
             me know if that will work and feel free to call to discuss. 317.8577

             Dan,




             I am glad you mentioned that dan, Nelson is coordinating the press conference. We fully
             anticipated the state's involvement but hadn't discussed who would be appropriate to
             attend.  I guess I would leave that up for you to sort out.   Nelson?

             Has Carol mentioned or is it your intention to hold a press conference Thursday to
             announce the resolution ? The AG and Governor would be (potentially) interested in
             attending . Would that be problematic from your standpoint?
