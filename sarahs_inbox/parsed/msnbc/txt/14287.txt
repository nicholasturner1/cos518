             MESSAGE:

             Congratulations on your new baby!  I read the story online and later saw Glenn Miller
             speaking of you and and your husband . I think the both of you are amazing for "feeling
             blessed and chosen by God."



             I wish you and your family many blessings.



            Warmest Regards,



            Brandi Volpe
