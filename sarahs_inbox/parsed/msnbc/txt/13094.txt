          True- absolutely agree with that principle and goal be it's Alaskans' money. But let me
          ask the others whats evolved in budget since early rebate discussions.

          Governor-




          Wesley Loy is asking if you support the idea of energy rebates. I seem to recall at a
          press availability several weeks ago you said you favor putting money back in the pockets
          of Alaskans - or words to that effect. Am I way off?
