           Hello gasline team- checking in- hoping all is well with all of you. I hear some of the
           anti's are griping about TC-Alaska again, let me know if I need to answer any of their
           gripes. You're doing great and people around the country are very excited about AK
           resource development.

            I hear that Exxon is attending the Monegan hearing(s)? That's odd.

             Again, hoping all is well and let me know what you need. Thank you folks!
