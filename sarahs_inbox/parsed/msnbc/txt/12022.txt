              You probably think I am crazy- it does show sometimes.



               I think the meeting was worthwhile also.             Tom

             Nah- it was just my party yesterday, but the rest of the family enjoyed themselves and
             Grandma's cake she brought for the crew- they understood why I wasn't there. My real b'day
             is today so it was not a big darn deal to get that CP update accomplished yesterday - in
             fact I'm so glad we did it so I could hear it all for myself.
