             Just fyi- clearing up the crap that critic(s) are spewing re: my girls riding with
             security (and me) while we're in Juneau. It'll be easier to just clear this up and do what
             I do in Anchorage - drive myself and not worry about whether it's appropriate to have the
             kids with me or not.

            It's hard to believe school staff would have commented, certainly they'd have no
            complaints re: anything being done unethically because nothing is being done unethically.
            Security just confirmed to me again that they've always served the entire first family. I
            told them, AGAIN, I want that in writing.



             I also just told Fred that I will do here in Juneau like I do in Anchorage - use Security
            very minimally, drive myself (esp when the kids are with me so no one perceives any abuse
            of priviledge). Here in Juneau I will drive the vechicle that is parked in the Gov's House
            garage and not ask for rides. I am also trying to use the house staff as minimally as
            possible (don't want them working any overtime, am not asking them to stay to clean up
            after events, etc... we as a family - and I personally - am doing as much of this as
            possible).



           There are too many other issues to have to worry about with my job - this type of issue
           must be cleared from my plate, and will be cleared, by not using Security as it's been
           (evidently) used in the past and accepted as common practice. This also brings up the
           matter of how many Security staffers are necessary, and I'd like Mike Nizich to work
           through that issue and bring me a recommendation.



           The complaints that are brewing re: my family' s use of Security should have been
                                                                1

             addressed, in writing, some time ago (when the criticism began), as it's an unnecessary
             burden and a timesink to continue to have to worry about this.



            I feel I've had to defend myself on this for months, and because others have advised that
            I just ignore it, I apologize for sounding curt on this but I do want it addressed, I do
            want recognition that my family is under a sharper microscope than evidently past Gov's
            family were, and we can't ignore that. We also need to come to terms with Security staff
            numbers and assignments to be fair to those Alaskans who are concerned about my family
            utilizing security services that were offered (but scaled way back) since my election.



            Another disturbing comment brought to my attention by an administrator this morning is
            that the only ones who could be complaining about this would be either staff at the house,
            or Security staffers. I don't believe that could be the case, especially not with house
            staffers because I am confident I don't ask them to do anything out of their specific job
            descriptions.



            Mr. Nizich: pls work through the issue of security, including the number and location of
            necessary staffers , and the policies regarding allowing my kids to be with me in
            vechicles, etc. Pls make sure it's fine that I drive the Gov's House vehicle to/from work
            and wherever else I need to go while in Juneau.



             Sharon: pls work to dispel any misperception that's out there, those rumors that have
            been spewed re: state employees "complaining", and state employees' duties and
            relationship with the First Family.



            Erika: again we'll be.ever vigilant to make sure no one can even be perceived as going
            outside their job description re: cooking or anything else at the house that they weren't
            hired to do.



            Thanks, hopefully this will be quickly resolved so no one's left guessing what's legal,
            what's not re: Security services provided by the State. Thank you.



            Final note: if there are ever complaints by state staff that willow and Piper stop in my
            office for a quick visit after school before they had to the hosue, that will be the
            kicker here. I've hard just one rumble about that - but if there are more, please let me
            know and I'll speak to whomever has a problem with my allowance of the girls visiting me
            here. They shall continue to visit me here as often as they'd like to.

             Hi Sharon,




             I only posted that comment about Ivy after I had confirmed it with three different
             sources . In fact this story has been out there for months including some school employees
             who wondered why state employees were shuttling kids to school on state time.




             If you are telling me it is not true then I will retract the comment.




             As far as Mat Maid, I have been getting information from very reliable sources and had no
             reason to doubt the comment about Joe Austerman moonlighting at Mat Maid. And for Ralph
             Carney's salary, I had several confirmations that his hourly wage was higher than what Van
             Treek's average hourly wage was.




            Again, if you'd like to provide me with additional information I have no problem
            retracting what I considered reasonable posts.




            Hope all is well. I saw your sister two weeks ago and she looks great.




            Cheers!

             Hi Andrew-



            I just read your most recent blog item regarding Ivy Frye and I feel compelled to respond.
            Ivy has never "shuttled" the Governor's children to school on state time-or any other
            time.  Furthermore, she has never even been asked to baby sit the Palin children. Where
            do you get this stuff? Leaving your readers with the impression that Governor Palin uses
            her staff for personal business is outrageous. in fairness, I think you should retract
            the erroneous information that was posted. Andrew, I have noticed many errors in your
            blog postings - especially items dealing with Mat Maid. I just shake my head when I read
            posts such as the one about Joe Austerman getting paid twice or the one about Mat Maid
            hiring a new CEO who was getting paid more than Mr. Van Treek etc. I feel posting
            misinformation is a great disservice to Alaskans. If you ever need clarification on
            anything, I hope you know you can always call me.

             Again, the FBI declined to share its evidence with the Department of Law, but we continue
             to monitor the evidence coming out in the trials.



             The Governor has NOT said the whole legislative process has been tainted. However, the
             outcome has been colored by the guilty pleadings of two executives and the actions of a
             few legislators. That does not make the Legislature as a whole guilty.    Here 's what she
             had to say last week:



                       "Aside from the corruption scandal where oil service company      executives have
             plead guilty to bribing certain lawmakers for a particular     oil tax outcome last year,
             and of course those corruption trials beginning            tomorrow, there's been a lot
             discussion out there in the public on that issue. There were obviously some lawmakers
             engaging in activities their          fellow lawmakers did not condone regarding the oil
             taxes and we have        many fine Alaskans serving in our Legislature. They're serving
             for the    right reasons and I do look forward to working with these legislators in      the
             coming weeks-and months-on new oil taxes."



             The audio file is attached.

             Sharon,




             Thanks so much for the quick response.




             So just so I'm correct, no internal   investigation has been done but the administration
             still feels the indictment of three   lawmakers proves the whole legislative process was
             tainted. (I don't want to put words   in your mouth but I'm trying to relay the truth as
             succinctly as possible. Let me know   if I'm off base.... and yes that is an open ended offer
             regarding any subject :) .




             Also just a reminder if the governor has some time on Tuesday, I'd be honored to have her
             on as a guest on Mike Porcaro's talk radio program.




             Thanks.
