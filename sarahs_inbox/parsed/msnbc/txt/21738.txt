                    I wanted you to be aware of the current situation.

                    We're working with the remnants of Arctic Power and others to promote some
                    counter battery fire.


                    ANWR: Lieberman renews bid for permanent drilling ban
                    A quarter of the Senate has signed on to keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
                    off-limits to oil and natural gas drilling.
                    Backed by a group of 25 senators, Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) introduced a bill
                    today that would designate the coastal plain of the Alaskan reserve as an official
                    wilderness area, thereby precluding any oil and gas activities.
                    "America's strength is not in our oil reserves but in our reserves of innovation,"
                    Lieberman said in a statement . "The answer is not to drill in our national
                    treasures but to increase our energy efficiency and find alternative and renewable
                    sources of energy."
                    All 26 sponsors are Democrats , excluding Lieberman and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-
                    Vt.).
                    The coastal plain is currently off-limits to drilling rigs, but Lieberman and other
                    lawmakers want permanent protection . Legislation in 1980 that expanded the
                   Arctic preserve deferred a congressional decision on managing energy resources
                    on the 1. 5-million-acre coastal plain.
                   Alaskan lawmakers and others seeking to boost domestic production have long
                    sought to tap an estimated 5.7 billion and 16 billion barrels worth of oil in the
                   region. Republicans came close to opening the area in the last Congress after
                   expanding their majority in the 2004 elections but fell just short.
                   The ANWR issue is not wholly partisan, with several pro-drilling Democrats in
                   favor of development and moderate Republicans having sink efforts to open the
                   reserve in the last Congress.
                   Opening the area is not on the table under the Democratic leadership of
                   Congress. At the same time, permanent protections are also considered quite
                   unlikely given the difficultly associated with getting the 60 votes needed to pass
                   such a measure.
                   Reps . Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) introduced House
                   legislation in January to designate the coastal plain as a wilderness area. House
                   and Senate legislation to create permanent protection has also been introduced in
                   previous sessions of Congress.

                      Dear Governor Palin,

                          The KAFC is an organization composed of scientists and concerned users of the
                      Kenai Peninsula waters . KAFC membership includes biologists (retired State and
                      Federal) which provide over 120 years of experience on the Kenai River and other
                      Peninsula waters in all areas of research and management . We consider the KAFC to be
                      a "Joe Fisherman" organization since we have no commercial interests.

                          It is our considered opinion that the state, and our fisheries , would best be served if the
                      Habitat Division were moved back under the auspices of the Department of Fish and
                      Game. As this is the only department with a mandate to protect these most valuable of
                      resources, we feel this would be the best path to insure the future health of our fisheries.
                      It would also be in the best interests of our state to begin this process as soon as possible.

                         We appreciate your time and attention regarding this very important matter.

                PRIVACY GUIDANCE

                On October 30, Secretary Spellings joined Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez and Secretary of
                Homeland Security Michael Chertoff at a high school in suburban Virginia to announce the
                availability of three new brochures that present guidance on the Family Educational Rights and
                Privacy Act (FERPA). In the wake of the Virginia Tech University shootings, these brochures --
                one for K-12 officials, one for higher education officials, and one for parents -- seek to empower
                schools to better balance students' privacy rights with school safety concerns by explaining the
                agency's interpretations in plain language. "I think it is important for people to understand what the
                current law allows," Secretary Spellings said. "It does allow [student records] to be shared,
                particularly when the student is a dependent (a child -- not an emancipated adult). So, before we
                leap into legislative changes, let's make sure that we're maximizing all of the flexibilities and
                information and latitudes that the law does provide within the context of privacy." The brochures
                also include contact information for obtaining additional assistance and guidance. FOR MORE

                 ADOLESCENT READERS INITIATIVE

                 On November 2, Secretary Spellings announced the national distribution of 520 ,000 free, new books as part
                 of the 2007 Adolescent Readers Initiative. The initiative, a joint venture between the Department and the
                 non-profit entity First Book, is designed to improve the literacy skills of struggling young adults in low-
                 income schools and communities. Most of the books donated for this effort are from Townsend Press's
                 "Bluford Series ," a batch of 13 novels that focus on the lives of a group of young high school students and
                 their families . Set in contemporary urban America, each novel addresses topics relevant to the lives of
                 today's students . Since June 2006, the Department, First Book, and major book publishers have
                 collaborated to distribute more than 1.65 million children's books to schools , libraries, and organizations
                 serving low-income students in hurricane-affected communities and throughout the country. FOR MORE

                Also: A recent study by the Center on Education Policy (CEP), "Reading First: Locally Appreciated,
                Nationally Troubled," finds the Department's Reading First program , while embattled in Washington, is the
                most highly rated No Child Left Behind program in terms of its effect on achievement . More thanthree-
                fourths of states and two-thirds of school districts with Reading First grants reported that the program's
                instructional initiatives and assessment systems were "important" causes of gains in student achievement.
                And, the program's impact is felt beyond just participating schools : over half of Reading First districts
                reported using elements of Reading First in non -Reading First schools and in the upper grades. Therefore,
                CEP recommends fixing and expanding the program. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO

                A COMPETITIVE EDGE

                The next "Education News Parents Can Use" broadcast (November 20, 8:00-9:00 ET) will focus on how
                 the Department, institutions of higher education, and other key stakeholders are working together to better
                prepare students for postsecondary education and the jobs of the 21st century . Today, more than 90% of
                the fastest-growing jobs require higher education and/or training . Moreover, three-quarters of those jobs
                require a college degree . Yet, 60% of Americans have no postsecondary credentials , and only one-third
                have a degree . At the same time, many Americans want to go to college but decide not to, either because
                they are unprepared or cannot afford the cost. In response to these challenges, in the fall of 2005, Secretary
                Spellings formed the Commission on the Future of Higher Education , facilitating a dialogue on the vital
                issues of accessibility, affordability, and accountability. Then, based on the commission 's findings, she
                developed and began implementing a detailed Action Plan
                (http :// www.ed.gov/about/ bdscomm/list/hiedfuture / actionplan-factsheet .himl). The broadcast will

                HIGHER EDUCATION REGULATIONS

                In a Federal Register notice (http://www.ed.,zov/legislation /FedRegister /proprule /2007-4/102207a. html),
                the Department declared its intention to establish one or two negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare
                proposed regulations for changes made by the College Cost Reduction andAccess Act to Title IV of the Higher
                Education Act. The actual number of committees and their organization will be based upon comments
                received in writing and at regional hearings . FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO
                http: / /www. ed.gov /policy/highered /reg/hearulemaking/2008 /-index2008. httnl.

                During the week of October 29, the agency published in the Federal Register three regulatory packages
                implementing changes to current federal student aid regulations. First, it published final regulations for
                Academic Competitiveness and National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) grants
                (http ://www.ed. og v/legislation /FedRegister /finrule/2007-4/ 102907a .html). Second, it published final
                regulations for the Federal Perkins Loan , Federal Family Education Loan, and William D. Ford Federal

                addressing, among other items, preferred lender lists, prohibited inducements, and "total and permanent
                disability" discharge. Third, it published final regulations for general provisions
                (http ://www.ed. gov/legiislation / FedRegister/ finrule/2007-4 /110107b .html). All of the regulations become

                CHARACTER EDUCATION
                On November 5, at a LEAGUE town hall meeting in New York City, Secretary Spellings highlighted the
                critical role schools play in developing character and teaching lessons like integrity and responsibility. "In
                today's competitive world, our students obviously need solid academic skills to succeed," she said. "But,
                they also need the ability to make responsible choices, the courage to stand up for what's right, and the
                compassion to help others ." At the event, the Secretary released a new guidebook , "Mobilizing for
                Evidence-Based Character Education," with a roadmap to help educators fully evaluate their programs.

                DOING WHAT WORKS

                Earlier this month, the Department launched a "Doing What Works" web site (help://dww.ed.gov/) to
                provide educators with recommendations on effective teaching practices to improve student achievement.
                The site has a user-friendly interface to quickly identify teaching practices that have been found effective by
                the agency's research arm, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), and similar organizations. It also cites
                examples of possible ways -- although not necessarily the only ways -- this research may be used to help
                students reach their academic potential. For example, teachers interested in successful strategies for helping
                English language learners can watch a video of eight techniques that teachers at one school use to teach
                vocabulary. Classroom scenes, student reactions, and graphic aids can all be viewed. In the future, similar
                resources will be available in the areas of cognition and learning, early childhood education, literacy, math
                and science, high school reform, and school restructuring.



                QUOTE TO NOTE

                "I don't think the way to do it is a one-size-fits-all national standard that morphs into a national curriculum
                that morphs into national textbooks. It's the wrong way to go, and it's a giant time-waster."

                -- Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings (11/5/07), answering a question on national standards during
                an interview with U.S. News & World Report

                  Stat Alert - November 8, 200 7
                 ACT has recently released a report, State of College Readiness for Latino Students,
                 that shows progress in our nation ' s performance on getting Latino students ready for
                 college. Based on their scores on ACT's battery of assessment tests, it suggests that
                 the improvements are due in part to more Latinos taking more rigorous , college-
                 preparatory coursework. Details can be found in the report located at
                 (htt ://www.act.org
