                Dear Governor Palin,
                   I hope you have access to the Mat-Su Section of the ADN today . The article on Pippel and his new city
                manager argues that had Allen been the city manager last year then Alien would have successfully used his
                connections to prevent the vetos of Palmer projects.  Talis
