            With the rising cost of fuel,I dont expect to see as many tourist as we seen in the
            past-If our State could some how manage to lower our gas prices for the tourist season.We
            would attract the moterhomes campers ect...it would be a great econmic shot in the
            arm.Shop owners B&Bs,charter boats,and everone related to the industry would benifit.Also
            it would be good for us Alaskans for just afew months to pay lower gas bills.It was just a
            thought have a great day.
