             Janice - I spoke with Nick and they have arranged the following. If this doesn't work, let me know and I can get
             back in touch with him.

             Governor - Nick also said that if you need anything (staff, arrangements, etc.) while you're down there, they are
             happy to assist in any way.

             Hi Kris-

             Please have Governor Palin come to the Oval Suite at the Willard Hotel at 10am on Saturday, February 23rd. This
             will be after she attends the RGA Business Meeting from 8:00-9:30. Other governors will be attending this coffee
             hosted by Senator McCain, but Nick assures you that he will make sure Governor Palin has time to speak with the
             Senator.

             Thanks,

             Christie
