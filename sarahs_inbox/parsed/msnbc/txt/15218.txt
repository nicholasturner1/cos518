                Chamber of the Americas CEO Gil Cisneros will lead a commercial visit to Belize from
                May 28th to June 2nd. Recognizing that Belize is an increasingly important player in
                U.S.-Latin American commerce, attracting international businesses and tourists,
                Cisneros is excited about the business opportunities presented in Belize. The Chamber
                will explore and discuss those possibilities during the commercial visit.

                Belize is located at the northern tip of Central America between Mexico and Guatemala.
                For tourists, the country's predominant allure is its eastern coast bordering the
                Caribbean Sea. However, the Chamber wants to inform its membership about Belize's
                other commodities as well, including the country's thriving real estate market and oil
                industry.

                "The U. S. is the biggest trading partner with Belize ," said Cisneros. "There are many
                Colorado business people in Belize involved in real estate development and tourism.
                Colorado is the second largest diving state ; and many of our state 's residents frequent
                Belize. Also, the country' s oil industry has been discovered by Colorado business folks."

               The Chamber's membership extends well beyond Colorado, with members located in
               34 states and 26 countries . Cisneros said that the Chamber wants to acquaint Belize
               businesses with their international counterparts and create commerce opportunities,

                especially in real estate, construction and the hospitality industries.

               "The goal is to make the proper high-level introductions so that we may start to introduce
               companies to one another," said Cisneros. "The other goals include strategic partnerships with
               various Belize organizations, a potential sister chamber office there, and a reverse trade
               mission. Since Belize is a struggling country, any business we can create between companies
               will provide jobs for Belizeans and other members alike."

               Cisneros will spearhead numerous discussions between American business representatives
               and Belizean dignitaries and commerce leaders during the five-day commercial visit. The
               itinerary includes meetings with the U.S. Ambassador to Belize Robert Dieter, Head of
               Corporate Banking of the First Caribbean Bank Glen Smith and Head of International
               Department of Atlantic Bank Ricardo Pelayo. Other meetings are scheduled with Tropic Air
               President Johnny Grief, Bowen, Bowen LTD President Sir Barry M. Bowen , The Belize
               Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Emile Mean and Town Council of San Pedro
               President Elsa Paz, among others.

               The commercial visit participants will witness first-hand some of the country's beauty when
               they travel to Belize. The Chamber wants to introduce its membership not only to the nation's
               boardrooms, but also inform them that the tourist mecca is both aesthetically and commercially
               attractive.
