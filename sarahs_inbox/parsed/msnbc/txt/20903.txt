          that she and Nizich had a
                                 -discussion about the issue and potential response but I have not
          had a chance to focus on the details.   I guess Cora also sent me an email that is my
          fault for not getting to.

         Mike - sorry to bug you again, but who was answering the letter? And Cora informs me we -
         incl the dept of law- have been investigating this Penney/Stevens issue since "I" received
         the letter? Are you aware of that?

          Im reading today' s article , ADN, about Penney ' s earmark from Stevens - it says the
          governor received a letter Sept 14 questioning the funds . Was that me, or was some letter
          sent Sept 14 during prior administration?




         Because i have not seen, nor heard about, any letter. In fact, except in passing when I
         heard Larry and Mike mention the ADN was on to another Stevens/Penney issue, I have never
         been informed nor privy to any info on this issue.




         I feel I need to be informed of these issues that deal with the state and end up on the
         front page of the newspaper. Please, if that letter was sent to me, allow me to see it. I
         would think I'd be asked about this issue , and we're lucky I wasn't already asked when a
         couple of reporters stopped me last week for Stevens' issues / comments.




                                                                   4
