              What a weird thing she'd spread about dr downing - whether true or not (and I can't
              believe it's true), strange she's talking about it in the context of midwife bd.

              Sen Green stopped by to shoot the breeze about 2 appointments Downing and Ekstrom. Said
              there is concern with Downing on the midwives board because she "apparently" nursed her
               on until he was 8, and she thought she was sanctioned.... but Green liked all of the Med
              Bd.  Ekstrom, predictably, didn't like how he wrote the Cowdery resolution.
