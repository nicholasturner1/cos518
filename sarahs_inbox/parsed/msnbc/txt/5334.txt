                   Dear Steve Flory,
                   Somehow I received this (your) message and now I can not , not, reply to you; and et al.
                   First, (your) passe, colonial, concept of "owning " Alaska 's (natural) resources is truly an amazingly parochial
                   concept and attitude, especially in this day and age. And here is exactly why:
                   We actually own nothing of the natural world-- but we do and should work hard at treating it wisely and with
                   utmost respect and consideration in perpetuity.
                   This acquired wisdom and respect may involve an intense 21st Century education, as well as, a thorough
                   understanding of the Alaskan Natives' own, ages old , mature credo.
                   This credo basically follows and results in a humble acceptance of the precious gifts presented by our land,
                   water, air and by all the original natural inhabitants found therein.
                   What it is not about, as you have written, is "bio-greenie "s, "Good Old Boy networks " or "Urban-Rural
                   Divide." It is also not about politicians or department heads and it is certainly not about blatantly dissing the
                   Governor of Alaska, in your obvious rush to arms.
                   Your call to arms of the " Sportsmen" of Alaska totally misses the target and does nothing at all to promote
                   unity or a better understanding of the complex and interdependant nature of all species and their individual
                   uniqueness in this total web-of-life that exists, both in Alaska and in the wide-world out there . Thank you for
                   giving me this opportunity to respond to you.
                   Sincerely, Alan R. Munro

                   Fellow Sportsmen,

                   Sarah said she would make changes , get rid of the Good Old Boy networks , and get tough with the Feds.
                   She championed the Constitution , which states that Alaskans own the resources and should use them.
                   She made that promise all over the state . She said , "Hold our feet to the fire".

                   Now more than ever, we have one last chance to let the Governor and her staff know that we invested
                   heavily in her , and we are going to hold her to her abundance management promises.

                   A virtual conspiracy placed Denby Lloyd as her Acting ADF&G Commissioner. With supporting ethical
                   shenanigans by the Joint Boards of Fish and Game , the Governor was handed a "list" that consisted of
                   one name, Denby Lloyd.

                   With callous disregard for state statute , the Joint Boards ignored the fact that the law directed them to
                   provide "a list of qualified persons", from which the Governor was to chose. The Good Old Boys couldn't
                   take the chance she might pick one of the others originally "short-listed" by the Joint Boards . This is a

                  sad commentary on the Governor who campaigned for transparency in government , higher ethical standards, and
                  changes in the status quo.

                  Now Lloyd has selected a "bio-greenie", Ken Taylor, as his Deputy of Game . You heard it right, the same
                  Ken Taylor that brought us Knowles ' wolf neutering fiasco , and helped reintroduce wolves into
                  Yellowstone (see the attached document for his full list of "accomplishments").

                  We cannot wait! Our moose populations are crashing around us , and Federal intrusion is at an all time high! This
                  may be the last chance we have for the next generation to enjoy the life style that Alaskan 's live for - an Alaska
                  where wildlife abundance is the rule, not the exception.

                  Candidate Sarah lifted the hopes and sprits of Alaskans and crossed the "Urban -Rural Divide" with her promise to
                  restore game populations to the shining star they were before political correctness crept in and captured
                  our ADF&G . She has written us the check of hope, it is now time to present that check to Governor Sarah for
                  payment.

                  There is one more chance to send her a message that you want changes . On Friday, March 2 at 3:30 P.M. the
                  Legislature's Resource Committees take up the confirmation hearings for Denby Lloyd and others. Call your
                  legislators and ask them to vote NO on Lloyd's confirmation. If they do, the Governor can begin an honest process
                  and request the Joint Boards to rethink their " list" definition . We Alaskans who elected Sarah Palin Governor
                  deserve no less.

                  Now is the time to call and/or email your Legislators today and let the will of the people be heard!
