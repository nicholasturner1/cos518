         The online "411" with the State is the outside email that goes to Constituent Affairs
         (sara h .pa li n @ a l as ka .g ov ) .



         The only google hit was on Newsminer's blog a blogger named "5050" back on April 17th put
         out the govpalin@alaska.gov address in response to an editorial by Chris Eshelman.



         Someone in Fairbanks has it...and is handing it out.



         That's an easy one to change if you'd like us to do so.

               Today, for some reason , I'm getting emails at this address that look like they're
         part of some mass gasline lobbying effort... can you track down how folks now have this
         address? It hasnt received mass emails in the past. Thanks

                 I would like to know what happen to the "All Alaskan Pipeline"? I am tired of the

                high cost of fuel in Fairbanks and Anchorage pays cheaper for fuel than Fairbanks.

                All three of you need to go to http://www.fairbanksgas.com/ and find out what the

                problem is and find a solution to it. I have already petitioned the federal

                congressional delegation about stopping oil speculation buying crude oil that is

                driving crude oil price up.




                I want a gasline that will benefit all Alaskans not just a few communities. I

                believe this proposal only benefits Anchorage and not Fairbanks or the State of

                Alaska. There needs to be more proposal submit before jumping on the first one that

                comes around.



                Thank you

             everyone else to get up here and see the swath of land for themselves. I've spoken w him about ANWR
             but don't remember if in that conversation 5 months ago I repeated our open invitation for him and other
