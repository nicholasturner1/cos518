                There were 11 people in the meeting. For the State, they were Marty, Tom, Pat, and
                Larry.

                Then, there were Senator Stevens and three of his staff: George Lowe (Chief of Staff), Kate
                Williams (Legislative Director), and Kevin Simpson (Energy). Also present were Senator
                Murkowski and two of her staff: Isaac Edwards (Legislative Director) and Chuck
                Kleeschulte (Energy).

                I can't figure out how Halcro got the information and don't know of any way to check at
                this end. Senator Stevens has always insisted on the confidentiality of such meetings and
                that has been respected by all concerned.

                We've spent part of this morning correcting some inaccurate information that came out of
                the meeting from the Senate side.

                  My first question is how did Halcro get this information. Someone in the meeting
                  obviously provided it. I don't like that. Such disclosure is not consistent with the
                  relationship we hope to have with the delegation.

                   In our debrief with the gas team afterwards , we discussed each DC meeting and what,
                   if anything, we need to do. We concluded that we should ask for a separate, low profile
                   meeting with Senator Murkowski in Alaska just to review the facts, and I have
                   requested this but have not heard back.

                   Senator Stevens is adamant ( and probably so is Senator Murkowski ). In our collective
                   opinion, we need to continue to educate and inform , not cut off communications.

                  Fortunately, we're not asking for anything now from Congress or the delegation. If
                  there is activity, it will be at FERC and perhaps DOE. The reality is that AGIA is the
                  only game in town, and I believe that the delegation understands that.

                  Larry and I are continuing to respond to specific questions from the delegation, and
                  hopefully that dialogue will help. The next big DC event is FERC's next report to
                  Congress on the gasline. Collectively, I believe we've done everything we can to help
                  FERC understand the current situation.

                  Because of the importance of your question, I'm taking the liberty of adding the
                  Governor to our email exchange.

                  P.S.
                  On a more optimistic note, all of the other meetings went very well. The participants
                  were interested and receptive.

                  Jan 30: Mr. AGIA goes to Washington

                  Last week, the AGIA architects traveled to Washington D.C. to deliver an AGIA update
                  back to Alaska's Congressional delegation.
                  With a year behind us and little progress, DNR Commissioner Tom Irwin and DNR
                  Deputy Commissioner Marty Rutherford ran head first into two skeptical Alaska
                  Senators.
                  In a meeting with both Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Irwin
                  and Rutherford encountered Senators unwilling to accept their sales pitch. Both
                  Stevens and Murkowski were reportedly cranky and blunt about AGIA.
                  Stevens apparently told Irwin and Rutherford, "You're not listening and you didn't
                  listen last time."
                  And, at one point, Stevens cut off Irwin as he was waxing poetic about the benefits of
                  AGIA and said, "Don't philosophize with me."
                  As a friend of mine pointed out, it's great political theater but it doesn't build a
                  pipeline.
