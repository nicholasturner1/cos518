FYI, Elsa Sargento (formerly of the Alaska State Community Service Commission) is the President of
Bridge Builders and Angelina Burney (from Commerce) is the Vice President. From what I learned
today, you will be sitting at Elsa's table. Also, Reverend Patterson from Shiloh will be performing the
Invocation. He is sitting with Malcolm Roberts.




Janice told me that she spoke w/you and it is not necessary that I staff tomorrow evening's event. I
did want to let you know that I (and Clark) will be there, although at a different table. Pastor Thomas
Davis invited us to attend.
