              What was the quote emailed from Sharon? What Russ said yesterday was fine tho we'll be
              expected to say more soon. I agree with Doogan. He doesn't deserve to be caught off-guard,
              he gets enough of that within.

             War over oil taxes may start again

             ROLL BACK: Huggins bill would change start date, abolish limit on

             deductions.



             By SEAN COCKERHAM

             scockerham@adn.com



             (01/19/ 08 04 :21:36)

             JUNEAU -- The war over oil taxes was rekindled Friday with a bill that

             would roll back parts of the multibillion-dollar tax increase on the

             North Slope oil companies that the Legislature passed only two months

             ago.

             Senate Resources Committee Chairman Charlie Huggins sponsored the bill.

             It would reverse the Legislature's decision in the November special

             session to make the oil tax hike retroactive to June 30.

             It also would abolish the limit on how much oil companies can deduct

             from their tax bill for operating costs at the Prudhoe and Kuparuk

             fields. Those are the two biggest and oldest North Slope oil fields.

             Huggins said putting a cap on deductions was never studied in Senate

             committees before it became part of the bill. And making the tax

             increase retroactive to June 30 wasn't fair, the Wasilla Republican

             said.

             "If I was an IRS man and said I was going to make a retroactive tax

             provision for you and your neighbors and everybody else in the United

             States, you would not be too happy," Huggins said. "For us to just

             summarily do that in Juneau to one of our business partners is a

                                                                  5




                                                                                                            P RA_GS PO 1 _0010339

              questionable process." His bill would make the tax effective on Jan. 1,

             2008.

             Anchorage Democratic Rep. Les Gara said reversing the retroactive part

             of the tax would cost the state about $600 million.

              "I don't think giving state money back to oil companies who are making

             record profits is the way to go," Gara said.

             Anchorage Democratic Sen. Hollis French pledged to fight Huggins' SB

             242. French said he expects it's going to be contentious.

              "My first thought was, here we go again," said French. "I'd hoped we had

             finished that debate and put it behind us."

             The limit on how much the oil companies can deduct from their tax bill

             was a huge issue for Democrats in the November special session on oil

             taxes.

             They managed to amend the tax to cap the growth in operation-expense

             deduction at Prudhoe and Kuparuk to no more than 3 percent a year.

             Many Democrats said they would never have voted for the oil tax without

             the cap on how much companies can deduct. One problem with the previous

             tax was that it wasn't bringing in nearly as much money as the state

             thought it would because of rising deductions, they said.

             Democrats called the cap a compromise that let them accept an oil tax on

             profits.

             Many really wanted a tax on the gross value of the oil -- which they

             argued would be less vulnerable to manipulation by sharp oil company

             accountants claiming deductions from their state tax bills.

             The cap on deductions is to go away after three years unless renewed.

             That's a sign lawmakers aren't comfortable with it, Huggins said, and

             are worried about what it is going to do to oil production in the state.



             FAST TRACK

             Senate President Lyda Green sent the bill to only one committee. That's

             an indication she doesn 't want it held up. The bill is going only to the

             Senate Finance Committee , where Sitka Republican Sen. Bert Stedman said

             that he'll hold hearings on it.

             The Senate passed the oil tax hike in the November special session over

              the objection of majority Republicans including Green, Huggins and

             Stedman. An alliance between Democrats in the bipartisan Senate majority

             and Republicans in the minority caucus got the tax through.

             The all-Republican minority had tried to keep the tax from being

             retroactive. So they could have sympathy for Huggins's attempt to roll

             that back.

             Senate Minority Leader Gene Therriault said he's surprised, though, that

             Republicans in the majority want to change the oil tax again so soon.

             Part of the argument in November against raising oil taxes too often was

             that it creates an unstable business climate, Therriault said.

             State House Speaker John Harris, R-Valdez, supported the oil tax

             increase but did not like the fact it was retroactive. Harris said he'd

             consider Huggins' bill if it can make it out of the Senate but does not

             know how he'd vote on it.

             PALIN SURPRISED

             Gov. Sarah Palin was the one who proposed the oil tax increase. Palin

             administration officials were surprised to learn of Huggins' bill on

             Friday.

             "i think it would be something that would inspire a lot of internal

             discussion," said Russ Kelly, the governor's legislative director.

             The oil company BP had a cautious reaction to the proposal to get rid of

             the retroactivity and the limit on how much it can deduct.

             "These are two elements of the (oil) tax bill that concerned us very

             much," said BP spokesman Steve Rinehart. "But we are still assessing

             Senator Huggins' legislation."

             According to Sen . Charlie Huggins, R-Wasilla, his bill would:

             * Change the start date for the oil tax increase the Legislature

             approved in November. The tax would start on Jan. 1, 2008, instead of

             June 30, 2007.

             * Abolish the limit on how much oil companies can deduct from their tax

             bills for operating expenses at the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields.

             The law now limits growth of those deductions to 3 percent a year.
