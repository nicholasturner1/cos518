              Make sure Mike's in the loop, but feel free to email me directly any time. Thank you
        very much for the meeting on Friday. I'm so glad to hear we're all on the same page there
        in recognizing it's long overdue to change some structure and bring in new energy to
        address the huge energy needs in Alaska.



               Bruce Anders and Marty Rutherford are also working on a plan to address
         comprehensive energy needs throughout AK. I'm ccing them so they're in the loop also.



              I'll be out of pocket for a few hours as I do two speeches in the Valley, then
        Anchorage, but feel free to email and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.



                 Thanks for helping on this. I'll cc Mike also so you two can communicate on this.



                 I sincerely appreciate your passion on this Emil. Thanks for moving forward.

                 Governor;



              Leo and I have a meeting with Privileged or at 10:00 am today. We will inform him at
        that time.  Do you have anyone in mind or a replacement? If not we could name an acting
       Privileged or Personal Ma Is it ok that I email you directly or would you rather I go through
        the COS.



                 Regards, Emil Notti
