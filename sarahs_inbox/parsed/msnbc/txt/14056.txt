                We do need the back up information for it. He threw it on Sunday's calendar and that is when we realized that we
                didn't even have a hearing request for it. Anything you all can get us would be good!
                Thanks!

                Suzanne,

                Thanks for the email. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Rep Meyer-he's one of my favorites. I wouldn't
                reference his name without first talking to him about it

                Would Rep Meyer hear HB 106 if he received a hearing request?

                Ivy

               Ivy,
               Thanks for the phone call yesterday. We appreciate it The funny thing is, I went back and looked at hearing
               requests that I have received, and we haven't even received a hearing request from the administration for HB
               106.

               Suzanne
