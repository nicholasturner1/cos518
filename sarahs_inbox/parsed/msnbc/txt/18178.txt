          Richard's work number is 269-5156.



          Geez, I'm sorry you haven' t been able to make contact .                 I thought everybody was like me
          and slept with their cell phones under their pillow.

         Tried both their cells, did not lv msgs again but neither were answered. Didn't try either
         one at home as it's a workday and I assume they wouldn"t be home. Guess I'll try the
         numbers here in this email again later.
