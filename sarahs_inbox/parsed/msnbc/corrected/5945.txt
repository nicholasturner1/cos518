         Isn't this a large mtg ? New info makes it sound like moving it isn't

         possible

         Anchorage Governor's Office?          Kari.

          The meeting is with the heads of the 13 Regional Corps, it is their .

          board meeting, and no speech, they just wanted to update you on their

          issues and just to meet you, they've been asking for this meeting since

          you were elected.

          What is the mtg this afternoon? Who

          invited me? What' s the agenda?

          I have the address and time, but that's it.



          I will not be speaking - I have not been told anything about speaking

          there so sure don't want to be caught off guard - they'll be just

          presenting some info to me on what's going on with their Native Corps?

          I'm guessing.

          In fact ,   is there any way the two ladies (Buretta and who else?) Can

          meet me in my Anchorage office instead of me driving over there after

          Karl Clausen ' s event? I don't know what time his gig is over with.
