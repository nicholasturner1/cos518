                    Subject: Mental Health Trust Nomination

                  Governor and Mike,

                  Jeff Jessee sent the MHTA nomination on February 22 (after the confirmation list was due to the Legislature).
                  I've included a memo with the nomination . If its good , I'll prepare a letter and send it down to the speaker and
                  president they already know this was going to be late. I provided a hard copy of the memo and the resume to
                  Karl and Janice yesterday so it may in your piles of reading material.

                  Also, when you guys have time, Local Boundary Commission is heating up. Privileged or Personal Material Red
                 Privileged or Pe, I'll explain why when I see you guys.
                  Thanks,
