               Dear Governor,
               CONGRATULATIONS! I was so happy and proud to hear the news this morning, like someone from my family
               was picked! In the short time we spent together and through our in depth conversationstinterviews, I not only
               enjoyed your company , but I realized what a great person, lady you are (as well as Todd, by the way, and we
               spoke about that too). I was for McCain before (you know, Air Force Pilot to Air Force pilot thing...) but now ifs
               a LOCK!
               Please remember I have great , In depth interviews with you that possibly could help you in your campaign (as
               well as great footage of your overall activities as a governor , wife and mother, and even beautiful shots of you
               playing the flute by the window , with snow falling outside).
               Let me know if I can be of help in any way.
               Again - Congratulations and good luck to you and Todd!

               Yours,
               Elan

              Dear state employees,

              As we take the opportunity at the end of our Alaskan summer to spend time with friends and
              family members this Labor Day, I want to thank you, the hard-working employees of the State

              we thank you for all you do to support the needs of your fellow Alaskans. Enjoy a safe and

              Governor Sarah Pain
