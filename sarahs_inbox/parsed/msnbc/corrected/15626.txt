               Subject : Parks Hwy MP315 Signs
               Dan,
               Received your letter dated 5/27/08 outlining AKDOT corrective action for oxidation on sign backs. Seems
               a bit heavy handed to replace sign panels that have been up and directing the Alaska public
               for the past seven months and show no sign of degeneration. The $60,00.00 warranty bond also seems
               somewhat high for a job that totals about $72,000.00 and you have paid only $42,000.00.
               It also flys in the face your offer to accept the job if the reflective sheeting manufacturer warranted their
               product in spite of back of sign oxidation. See both attached letters. Yours and theirs. I also have
               attached a new letter from my aluminum supplier backing up our claim and the accepted submittals you
               already posses stating the chromate conversion coating has indeed been applied.
               Taking into account this new information, if Jolt is still in non-conformance with Standard Secification 730-
               2.01, please detail precisly what that non-conformance is.
