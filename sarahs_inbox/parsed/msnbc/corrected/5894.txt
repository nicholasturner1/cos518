             Subject: DMVA
             I did not know about Rep. Dahlstrom's bill re: no political allies in promotion of DMVA high-
             level, but read about it in today's ADN.

             It gives a good opportunity to advise Craig Campbell on his need to fill the DMVA Dep.
             Commish position with someone with military experience. (I've struggled with the idea of NOT
             having militiary exp. fill that role - it's ironic that Nancy was working on such a bill.)

             Anyway, we need to be proactive here and remind Craig of progress on that bill (and JB - pls tell
             Nancy I support it).

             Could THIS opportunity be one for thinking outside the box and promoting someone with a
             "diverse" perspective on AK issues for a high-ranking position in the Palin-Parnell admin?

             Tib - remind me to talk to Craig about this today please.

             The Lt. Gov. and Kris Perry know of our need to broaden our search for candidates in particular
             areas of public service.

             thanks!
