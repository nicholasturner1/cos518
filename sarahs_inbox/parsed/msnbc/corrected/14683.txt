                Both Anna Kim and I will be in Anchorage on Monday. I am meeting separately with Kris to review all issues with
                departments in my portfolio, but Anna and I were hoping to be able to meet with you for 10-15 minutes each to
                cover the high priority issues. Please let me know if you have any time available on Monday.

                Thanks

                 Randy
