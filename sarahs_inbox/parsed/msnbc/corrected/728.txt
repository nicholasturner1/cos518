I will respond via email so that all are up to date. I checked on the Open House progress this last
Friday. We have three vendors that are making the baked goods (22,000)from here in Juneau. The
Christmas tree from Thorne Bay that is donated to the House will be delivered the week of
Thanksgiving. The Juneau Republican Women will be decorating the House (all volunteer). In return
they like to help staff during the Open House ie-answer door, etc. A list will be going around this next
week to staff so that they can sign up for staffing at House. The Commissioner's always do the
serving of goodies and hot cider outside to those waiting in line.



Todd had asked if we could do something for the Republican Women that volunteer. An idea could
be a reception or luncheon that you host at the House for them after the holiday season even.
Thanks, Janice
