             Subject:                Thank you!


             Rhonda: thanks for traveling to Galena! Todd is so excited to have seen some success
             stories out there and I'm very thankful you were there too. Thanks for your obvious
             dedication to rural, Rhonda, and for helping us think of things we can do to celebrate the
             successes and help with the challenges in rural.
