                  I'm sure you've been to Pt Mack Correctional Farm before, but just in case: Travel along Pt. MacKenzie Road
                  until it dead ends at the T. Turn right at the T onto gravel, proceed a few hundred yards and turn left onto Ayrshire
                  Road. Approximately 2 miles down Ayrshire make a left hand turn onto Guernsey Road and proceed
                  approximately 1/2 mile to the Farms main gate.

                  See you there at I lam. It was fun today, thanks.
