  Hello Todd.

  I really hate to bother you, as I'm sure you're busy with summer in full swing! I need a little help with Willov

  Here are some events from the Governor's calendar during that time period:
   /13 Soldotna Global Awards: 6/13 Visit Mat Maid Dairy; 6/13 AK Global; 6/14 Nine Star to Read to Kids: E

  Did she happen to attend any of these or do you know of any others not on the calendar- I just need one?

  Her new TA from Jnu-Anch begins 6/19 and has the Mat-Su event as the purpose, so she could fly back it

 Call or email if you have any questions.

 Thanks!
 Erika

   hank you,
   rika
