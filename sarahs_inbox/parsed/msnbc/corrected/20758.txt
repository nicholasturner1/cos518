           This is the information that we have used to respond to the press on

           this topic. Mi. Katz and his staff helped put this together. I have

          more information if you need it! Bottom line - the previous high was

           $550 million requested in FFYO5 down to $197 million requested in FFYO9.

          Alaska's self-sufficiency has always been a top priority of the

          Governor. Consistently, from year to year, this goal has been reflected

          by a reduction in the number of appropriation requests submitted by her

          Administration. Since taking office, Governor Palin has reduced this

          number by half.



          For FFYO7 the Murkowski Administration submitted 63 earmark requests

          totaling $350 million. For FFYO8 Governor Palin reduced the number of

          requests submitted by the state to 52, totaling $256 million. Most

          recently, for FFYO9, the Governor further reduced the number of

          appropriation requests submitted by the state to 31, totaling $197

          million. Of these 31 requests, 27 represent continuing or previous

          appropriations.

          Appropriation requests submitted by the state only represent those of

           Governor Palin's Administration and do not include those requested by

           other local entities, the University of Alaska, or the Alaska Rail Road.

           The state typically does not advocate on behalf of these groups.



           In regard to the $550 million figure cited in the Governor's March 2008

           Fairbanks News-Miner Op-Ed, the article should have specified that the

           $550 million figure was referring to appropriation requests from a

          previous year. In particular, Governor Murkowski submitted 116 earmark

           requests totaling $550 million in FFYO5.
