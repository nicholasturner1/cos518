          Thank you Governor. I'm sure I will work well with Chuck.



          I'm sorry to read the stories in the paper. I know that's not the full story. It's been a
          tough weekend.



          If there is anything we can do to help, just let us know.

          We're replacing Walt with Chuck Kopp from Kenai. It's all good. Except we asked Walt to
          move to the ABC Board Ex Dir position so he could utilize his talents and connections with
          Rural Ak and help address the bootlegging problem (leading to horrendous other problems)
          in our villages... he said no to that offer. Chuck starts on Monday.

             Governor.

             I am really looking forward to working with Chuck and accomplishing some priorities. With Chuck's leadership, I
             think we can get more done in the area of public safety this next session than we have in the last two.

             I will be in Anchorage on the 17th and would like to spend as much time as possible with him reviewing issues
             and personnel.

             He should also meet with Commissioner Kreitzer right away as she has ideas on how to change some existing
             DPS policies that impede recruiting. They also need to coordinate on all the staffing studies, etc., Audie
             Holloway has been working on. I will talk to her about this tomorrow and see if she is also available on the
             17th.

             I am also working on a draft press release / announcement for Sharon to review on his hiring and will mention a
             few specific areas that he will be focusing on right away. I will coordinate with her and Mike Nizich today. I will
             cc: it to you for review. Thanks.

              Thanks Governor,

              I hope Walt can exit gracefully. I worked with Chuck on the Police Standards Counsel , and he seems like a well
              spoken , proffessional guy. Once announcements are made, I'll call him and offer support and welcome him
              aboard . Your recent example of supporting "clean -up" and ethics within public safety is loud and clear in the
              public, so he should have no problem moving the right way.

             thanx for the heads up , talk to you later

             Joe

              Governor,

              Thanks for your email . I look forward to working with Chuck and supporting his efforts in any way I can. You
              have a good team of cabinet members and I know he will get everyone else 's support as well. Helping rural
              Alaska transition to a new regime of higher fuel prices and tightening budgets will take all our creativity and
              teamwork.

              At DEC, we are seeing impacts from the higher fuel prices in our Village Safe Water program . Villages are
              spending money on fuel that use to go to maintenance and replacement parts . A number of villages anticipate
              not having enough money to purchase the fuel they need this winter to heat and run the systems . In some
              instances, if a system freezes, it would have to be replaced. I am having our staff inventory where all of the
              villages we serve stand going into the winter. We will then assess what additional support we might be able to
              bring, with the help of others, to the villages.

              I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming picnics - lets hope for a break in this weather.

              Larry
