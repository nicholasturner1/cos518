            Hi,


            I have a card of congratulations         here that never got sent. Are you          and the 'first
            girls/family' coming to Michigan         for the Governor's Conference? We          live only forty
            miles away and would love to see         you all. We understand that Track          is playing
            hockey in the state. We read the         Frontiersman daily and follow all          of your
            adventures.

            Missing Alaska,
            Mrs. Mac
