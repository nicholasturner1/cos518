           Governor - I just received a phone call from Representative Bob Roses. Rep. Roses would
           like to speak with you directly regarding a campaign kick-off that he is arranging and
           would like you to be a part of.




           He can be reached at     Privileged   (cell)




           Thanks, Janice
