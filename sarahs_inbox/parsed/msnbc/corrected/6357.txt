             Governor:

             Congressman Young 's office called this morning . They are about to send out their
             newsletter which includes a picture of you and the Congressman . I left a message
             requesting a copy of the picture and cutline . Given the news stories of late , they wanted to
             know if we had any strong feelings about running it.

             Any thoughts?
