             Did you hear john harris on the news??? There shouldn't be a conflict w chenault running
             the fin committee b/c there's not a conflict having todd on the slope. HUGE difference!
             Todd isn't a lawmaker! He's not considering or voting on any legislation that will effect
             our entire state.
