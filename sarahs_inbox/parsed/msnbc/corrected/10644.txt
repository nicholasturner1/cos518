              Sounds good for Lt. Governor to attend AGIA mtg. Still haven't heard what time team wants
              for mtg, but last wk it was noted that the mtg would be held in the afternoon.



              Kaylene can come in before that mtg.



              Still not sure on coming in on sat for zoo opening.



              Christmas was great! Hope it was for your family too.



              I'm in the Anchorage office if you need me.

              The Lt. Governor's office just called and said that the meeting the Lt. Gov is referring
              to tomorrow is the same gasline meeting that is being requested by the gasline team. The
              Lt. Gov is on personnel leave right now but will come in for the meeting. Janice
