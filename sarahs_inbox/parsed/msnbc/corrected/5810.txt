            Subject: Re: Press Availability Notes
           Joe B. will craft a letter for VP Chaney to edit - it shall be supportive of our agia process . (We'll
           see where Chaney's edits go, ultimately, but at least he took me up on the offer to voice his
           support of agia anyway.)

           So what was the overall tone of Huggins, et al? Do the reporters know it's futile for the producers
           to essentially be revisiting their wishlist from Murkowski's deal? Does Huggins know that?

             Would like to make one of you available to Steve Quinn , Bill McAllister and Christina
             Grande re: the AGIA questions posed.

             From the press conference, you wouldn't know what's going on behind the scenes.

             Thanks,
