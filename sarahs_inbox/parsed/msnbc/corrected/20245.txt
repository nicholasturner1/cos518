          If they need me today in Juneau they can chat w me in the office... I haven't have an
          availability since last week- hopefully we'll have a good topic to kick off a press
          availability, and/or we'll have to strategize on keeping leggies over if they can't
          compromise on Energy Bill (I'll be asked about that today in Juneau)
