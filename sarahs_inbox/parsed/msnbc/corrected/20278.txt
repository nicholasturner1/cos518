          Never mind- I hear now that I'm not the keynote. I guess I just introduce the guy.

         Joe/steve: I'm the keynote at tomorrow night's renewable energy fair in Anchorage, but the
         speech Kate sent me is just a couple of minutes long and doesn't say much about
         renewables. Have you guys been asked to add to the speech?

         I'm reading the keynote for tomorrow's renewable energy speech- it's only a couple of
         minutes long... are you sure I'm the keynote? I'd think this should be much longer. Did
         Joe or Steve add to this?
