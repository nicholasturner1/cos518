         We're replacing Walt with Chuck Kopp from Kenai. It's all good. Except we asked Walt to
         move to the ABC Board Ex Dir position so he could utilize his talents and connections with
         Rural Ak and help address the bootlegging problem (leading to horrendous other problems)
         in our villages... he said no to that offer. Chuck starts on Monday.

              I think its great. If anyone has anything else, that's fine... but it looks to me like it's good to go.
