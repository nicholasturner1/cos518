         Governor - In checking with the USPS the time they have set for the ceremonies is 11:00
         a.m. in Wasilla. I wanted to make sure this is not too late for you to begin.




        Also, you then had listed on the FYI sheet as a 1:00 - 1:30 p.m. speech - (ANC) Opening
        Ceremonies for the DVAM - victims of domestic violence, which you may not make if doing
        the USPS event.




        Scheduled for the afternoon would be NEA and hopefully             Rep. Neuman .      Thank you, Janice
