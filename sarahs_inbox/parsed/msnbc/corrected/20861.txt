             I am very angry after hearing of the increasing involvement of Mr. Patin in state business , meetings and emails.
             As an Alaskan resident of almost 29 years , I am almost in disbelief of this seemingly accepted practice in the
             governor's office and business.

             We did not vote for Mr. Patin, and unless he holds an official capacity , he has no business attending meetings and
             being cc'd on state business emails . I feel that Governor Patin is throwing aside common sense and especially
             respect for Alaskan constituents to condone and encourage this type of political behaviour : I'm so disappointed
             and disgusted. I will continue to monitor this development and speak out against this practice . Send Mr. Palin
             home and give us a good explanation of why you ever thought this was going to be OK with Alaskan residents!
