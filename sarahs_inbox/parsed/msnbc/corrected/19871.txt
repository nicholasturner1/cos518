           Dear Gov. Palin,




           I have known Chuck Kopp all of his life; he is a man of integrity and there is no one who
           could do a better job both for rural and urban areas.  He grew up in rural Alaska and
           understands the problems we face.




           He has an excellent grasp of rural issues in our villages. Fort example, alcoholism,
           resulting in abuse of our children, as well as underage drinking, are common. He knows
           how to deal with this problem.




           I,   as




                                                               1




                                                                                                             PRA GSP01 0021844
